                    REPORTER'S NOTE.
                    The experience of these reporters has determined the impracticability of
                         making just parliamentary reports of the Proceedings and Debates of the
                         Legislature in connection with the Daily newspaper press. Their experience
                         has also determined that the work itself is practicable, desirable,
                         valuable; and they think too that it is neither a difficult nor a desirable
                         job. They have been working through thirteen volumes without the protection
                         of copyright, and from this it is plain enough that the price they have
                         received for the BREVIER does not invite competition.
                         Their suggestions in the last volume as to the continuance of these Reports
                         have not been entertained by the legislative mind, and, need not be
                         repeated. They say now that the BREVIER is a failure
                         without the positive sustaining hand of the State; and because that hand
                         has not been extended to these reporters, they accept it as notice to quit
                         work with the regular session of the body they are serving.

                         SESSION, IN THE CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS, 1872.
                    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.

                         elect of the House of Representatives of the XLVIIIth General Assembly of
                         the State of Indiana, were convened this day (Wednesday, November 13, 1872,
                         at 2 o'clock P. M.) in their respective halls in the Capitol, in
                         the city of Indianapolis, in pursuance of the following proclamation by the
                         Governor:
                    STATE OF INDIANA,
                              EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.
                    WHEREAS, The public welfare requires that the General
                         Assembly of the State of Indiana should be convened in special
                         session:--Whereof,
                    In pursuance of the constitutional provision on that subject, I, Conrad
                         Baker, Governor of the State of Indiana, do, by this proclamation, call a
                         special session of said General Assembly, to be held at the State House in
                         Indianapolis, commencing at two (2) o'clock P. M. of Wednesday,

                         members and the members elect thereof to meet at their respective Halls of
                         Legislation in said State House at the time above designated.
                    In witness whereof, I have hereunto subscribed my name and caused the seal of
                         the State to be affixed, at the [L.S.] city of Indianapolis, this 22d day
                         of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two.
                         CONRAD BAKER By the Governor.
                         JOHN H. FARQUHAR,
                         Secretary of State By O.M. EDDY, Deputy 
                    
                         IN SENATE.
                         
                              WEDNESDAY, November 13, 1872.
                         
                         At 2 o'clock P. M. this day, the hour designated in the
                              proclamation of the Governor for convening an extraordinary session of
                              the General Assembly, Hon. JAMES W. COLE, the Assistant Secretary of the last regular session of
                              the Senate, recently elected a member of the House of Representatives
                              from the county of Tippecanoe, rapping on the President's
                              desk, called Senators to order and said:
                         
                         Inasmuch as the Principal Secretary of the last Senate is absent, I will
                              appoint Captain Olive to organize the Senate, as he was my assistant
                              two years ago.
                         Mr. WILLIAMS. The Senator from Fulton [Mr. Smith] has a written
                              statement from Mr. Harrison, the last Secretary of the Senate, in
                              relation to that matter, which I would like to have read to the
                              Senate.
                         The CHAIRMAN [Mr. D. H. Olive in the chair.] I suppose it would not be
                              out of order to read it.
                         Mr. SMITH read a letter from Mr. W. R. Harrison, late Secretary of the
                              Senate, stating that circumstances preventing his being present, he
                              desired Senator Smith should act in his stead at the opening of the
                              Senate, and make for him a proper excuse.It is as follows:
                         
                              
                                   
                                        MARTINSVILLE, IND., November 11, 1872.
                                        
                                             Hon. Milo R. Smith:
                                        
                                        DEAR FRIEND:--Usage
                                             probably requires that I should, as late Secretary of
                                             the Senate, be present at its organization.
                                             Circumstances, family sickness and important business,
                                             both combine to prevent my being present.
                                        I desire that you will act for me at the opening, and
                                             render for me the proper excuse. The principal thing to
                                             do, I suppose, is to call the roll of Senatorial
                                             Districts, and aid the President in organizing.
                                        The Librarian, Mr. DeSanno, will deliver to you or my
                                             successor the Secretary's calendar, desk or
                                             secretary--the one in which we kept the bills and other
                                             papers properly filed--also the register of last
                                             session, and the bills left over as unfinished
                                             business.
                                        My abstract at the close of the last Senate Journal will
                                             indicate the state of each bill at the close of
                                             business.
                                        You will find the table of Districts Senatorial at the
                                             opening of the last session's BREVIER REPORTS. I will be
                                             up and render any assistance in my power to aid useful
                                             legislation, as soon as disengaged from present
                                             engagements and difficulties.
                                        My partner, Mr. Shirley, who will deliver this, is a
                                             member of the other House, and will aid you in any way
                                             he can. You will find him anxious to do right, and a
                                             zealous worker.
                                        
                                             Truly yours, etc.,
                                             W. E. HARRISON.
                                        
                                   
                              
                         
                         Mr. WILLIAMS. There can be no doubt but that Mr. Harrison would have the
                              right to organize the Senate if he was here; and in the absence of Mr.
                              Harrison, Mr. Cole would have the right; but if there is to be a
                              deputy appointed, the question is who has the right to appoint? Has
                              Mr. Harrison, who was the Principal Secretary, or Mr. Cole, who was
                              the Assistant? To remedy this, if it meet the approbation of the
                              Senate, I will make a motion that the Senator from Wayne [Mr. Beeson]
                              act as Presiding Officer of the Senate until its organization, and
                              that the Senator from Fulton [Mr. Smith] act as Secretary, as by
                              authority from Mr. Harrison, the ex-Secretary. I have not consulted
                              with my friend over the way [Mr. Beeson], but I presume that would be
                              satisfactory all round. Some objection may be raised to Mr.
                              Smith's acting as Secretary because he is a Senator elect,
                              but we had a case in point in 1863. Thomas M. Browne acted as
                              Principal Secretary in 1861, and it was his duty to organize this body
                              in 1863. In 1863 Mr. Browne was a Senator, and notwithstanding he was
                              a Senator, we gave him that right and he exercised it.
                         Mr. THOMPSON said that the reading by Senator Smith could not be heard
                              in that part of the chamber, in consequence of which the remarks of
                              Senator Williams were not fully appreciated.
                         Mr. SMITH. What I read was simply an appointment made by Mr. Harrison,
                              former Secretary of the Senate, and an excuse for his not being
                              present on account of sickness in his family.
                         Mr. TAYLOR. I insist that there is as yet no organization, and that the
                              Chair can not entertain any motion.
                         The CHAIRMAN [Mr. D. H. Olive.] I was waiting till Mr. Williams should
                              get through with his remarks. As the Senator [Mr. Taylor] says, there
                              is no organization yet, and consequently no motion can be made, Mr.
                              Cole being present by proxy as he has appointed me to speak for him in
                              this case--I hold that there is nothing in order but the calling of
                              the roll, and that no motion should be entertained until the
                              organization of the Senate.
                         SEVERAL SENATORS. "Call the roll."
                         The CHAIRMAN. I will first call the roll of old members--the members
                              holding over.
                         
                              
                                   
                                        SENATORS HOLDING OVER
                                        answered as the counties they represented were called, as

                                        Senators holding over all answered to their names
                                             excepting M. T. Carnahan, from the counties of Posey
                                             and Gibson.
                                   
                              
                         
                         SENATORS ELECT.
                         The CHAIRMAN. The next thing in order will be the calling of the roll of
                              Senators elected. As they are called, they will please answer.
                         Mr. ROSEBROUGH. The question is rather a novel one, but the question is
                              this : The Secretary of the Senate is the proper party to call the
                              Senate to order. That is a matter of precedent. When the Secretary is
                              absent, whether the appointee of the Secretary or the appointee of the
                              Assistant Secretary shall call the Senate to order don't make
                              much difference in public policy or parliamentary usage, except so far
                              as precedent goes. I don't suppose there can be any advantage
                              gained by the present or any further call that might be made. That is,
                              I don't suppose it would advantage either party in the State
                              as a political measure, whether the Secretary should call or whether
                              his appointee should call, or whether the appointee of the Assistant
                              Secretary should call the Senate to order, and call the roll. Now, the
                              question is this : What is right and what is just in the premises?
                         Mr. DWIGGINS. (Interposing.) I rise to a point of order. I like to hear
                              the gentleman [Mr. Rosebrough] talk very much, for he talks very well
                              ; but it seems to me there is nothing before this body. It seems to me
                              that nothing is in order except to call Senators, that we may
                              organize. Therefore, I think the gentleman is entirely out of
                              order.
                         The CHAIRMAN. I think myself discussion is altogether out of order. But
                              I suppose there is no gentleman in the house who objects to hearing a
                              few remarks. I want to do just what is right, so far as I am
                              concerned.
                         Mr. DWIGGINS. I think the call should proceed.
                         The CHAIRMAN. I think there is nothing else in order.
                         Mr. ROSEBROUGH. Does the Chair sustain the point of order?
                         The CHAIR. Yes, sir.
                         Mr. ROSEBROUGH. Then I appeal from the decision of the Chair.
                         The CHAIRMAN. There is no Senate to appeal to.
                         Mr. ROSEBROUGH. If there is no appeal, there is no Chair.
                         Mr. BROWN. (In his seat.) There is one, for the Senator from Ripley [Mr.
                              Rosebrough], if he is disposed to take it.
                         Mr. ROSEBROUGH. I am not disposed to take it until compelled to by the
                              action of this body.
                         SEVERAL SENATORS. " Call the roll."
                         The CHAIRMAN. There is nothing in order but to call the roll.
                         Mr. ROSEBROUGH. I appeal from the ruling of the Chair.
                         The CHAIRMAN. There is no Senate to appeal to.
                         Mr. ROSEBROUGH. The question is, whether the gentleman acting; as
                              Chairman can act as Chairman of this body.
                         SEVERAL SENATORS--"Call the roll."
                         Mr. ROSEBROUGH--Is this a mob, or a deliberate body?
                         Mr. BROWN. (In his seat.) I think it is a mixture.
                         The CHAIRMAN. Senators elect, as their names are called, will please
                              step forward, hand over their credentials, and be sworn in by Judge
                              Downey, who is present.
                         The Senators elect then presented their credentials, as their districts
                              were called, in the following order:

                                             From the counties of Delaware and Madison--James

                                             From the counties of Adams and Allen--John D.

                                             From the counties of Lawrence and Monroe--George

                                        Senate:
                              I am profoundly grateful to you for this mark of your confidence
                                   and respect. To be called to preside over the deliberations of
                                   this body, composed as it is of gentlemen of so much experience,
                                   learning and ability, is a compliment for which I am sincerely
                                   thankful. I cannot but regret that your choice had not fallen
                                   upon one more worthy, and better qualified to discharge the
                                   important duties of this position, However, with your
                                   co-operation I shall enter upon and discharge its duties as best
                                   I am able, promising you zeal and impartiality in the discharge
                                   of its duties.
                              And in conclusion may I not express the hope that we will, as far
                                   as possible, banish party feeling from this chamber, and remember
                                   only that we are legislators for a great and growing
                                   commonwealth; and that we will earnestly address ourselves to
                                   such matters of legislation as will redound to the honor and
                                   welfare of the great State of Indiana.

                                   Doorkeeper for the Senate.
                              Mr. TAYLOR nominated Theodore W. Pease, of the county of
                                   Marion.
                              Mr. FULLER. I put in nomination Jamee W. Cookerly, of Monroe
                                   county.
                              There being no further nominations, the ballot resulted--for Mr.
                                   Pease, 26 votes; for Mr. Cookerly, 22 votes.
                              The PRESIDENT. Theodore W. Pease, having received a majority of all
                                   the votes cast, is declared duly elected Doorkeeper of the
                                   Senate. 
                         
                         
                              NOTIFICATION OF ORGANIZATION.
                              Mr. ORR. I offer the following resolution:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             Resolved, That the Secretary be
                                                  instructed to inform the House that the Senate has
                                                  organized by the election of Hon. George W.
                                                  Friedley, of Lawrence and Monroe counties,
                                                  President of the Senate; David H. Olive, of Boone
                                                  county, Principal Secretary ; P. P. Culver, of
                                                  Tippecanoe county, Assistant Secretary; and
                                                  Theodore W. Pease, of Marion county Principal
                                                  Doorkeeper, and that the Senate is ready to
                                                  proceed to legislative business.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              The resolution was adopted.
                         
                         
                              NOTIFICATION TO THE GOVERNOR.
                              Mr. WADGE. I move the appointment of two Senators to act with a
                                   committee to be appointed by the House, to inform His Excellency,
                                   Governor Baker, of the organization of the General Assembly.
                              The motion was agreed to, and--
                              The PRESIDENT subsequently appointed Messrs. Wadge and Fuller as
                                   such committee on the part of the Senate.
                         
                         
                              RULES OF THE SENATE.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS. I offer the following resolution:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             Resolved, That the Senate adopt
                                                  the rules of the special session of 1869 for its
                                                  government, until such time as permanent rules
                                                  shall be adopted.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Mr. BROWN. I move to amend the resolution by saying that we adopt
                                   the rules of the regular session of the last Senate, with the
                                   exception of this amendment of the 8th rule, which is to add
                                   after the word "the," in line 2, the words
                                   "Presiding Officer of the Senate." It will then
                                   read, "thirty-one standing committees, of not exceeding
                                   seven members each, shall be appointed by the Presiding Officer
                                   of the Senate at the commencement of the session." The
                                   reason I do this is that these rules are more familiar to the
                                   majority of the present Senate than the rules the Senator over
                                   the way [Mr. Dwiggins] has referred to.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS. The rules of the last Senate were the rules of the
                                   special session of 1869, with the amendments offered then by the
                                        Committee on Rules, with the exception of
                                   the amendment that the committees be thirty-one, instead of
                                   twenty-eight. I think they are better without the amendment than
                                   with it.
                              Mr. BROWN. The only change necessary, I think, is to place the
                                   power of appointing the committees in the hands of the Presiding
                                   Officer instead of the body.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS. They also provide for the meeting of the Senate at 2
                                   o'clock P. M. each day.
                              Mr. BROWN. There is no necessity for meeting sooner than 2
                                   o'clock now. The rules I have proposed provide for the
                                   meeting at 2 o'clock, just the same as the others.
                              The amendment was agreed to; and the resolution, as amended, was
                                   adopted.
                         
                         
                              REORGANIZATION OF THE JUDICIARY.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS. I have still an additional resolution. With the
                                   permission of the Senate I will read it myself.
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             Resolved, By the Senate, the House
                                                  of Representatives concurring. That a joint
                                                  committee, consisting of one Senator and two
                                                  Representatives from each Congressional District
                                                  of the State, be appointed--those of the Senate by
                                                  the President thereof, and those of the House by
                                                  the Speaker thereof--whose duty it will be to
                                                  prepare a bill for the reorganization of the
                                                  judicial system of the State, and report the same
                                                  to both Houses on the sixth day of the next
                                                  regular session of this General Assembly ; and
                                                  said committee shall have authority to sit during
                                                  the interim between the present and next session
                                                  of this General Assembly.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              
                              I move that this resolution lie on the table, and be made the
                                   special order for 2 o'clock next Wednesday.
                              Mr. GLESSNER. I submit the following as a substitute for the
                                   resolution just offered:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             WHEREAS, It is evident that the
                                                  public good requires gome change in the present
                                                  judicial system ; therefore--
                                             Resolved, By the Senate and the
                                                  House of Representatives, That a joint committee
                                                  be appointed, to consist of eleven members, four
                                                  of the Senate and seven of the House, to be
                                                  selected one from each Congressional District,
                                                  whose duty it shall be to take into consideration
                                                  the propriety of reforming the judicial system of
                                                  the State ; and report by bill or otherwise at an
                                                  early day in this session.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Mr. DWIGGINS. I move that the substitute also lie on the table, and
                                   be made the special order for 2 o'clock next Wednesday
                                   afternoon, and that there be two hundred copies printed for the
                                   use of members.
                              Mr. BROWN. As far as the printing is concerned, I move to strike
                                   that part out. They will be printed in the papers in the
                                   morning.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS. I will accept that amendment.
                              Mr. ROSEBROUGH. I would suggest that this is probably the most
                                   important measure that will come before this Legislature. It has
                                   more to do with the permanent welfare of the State than any
                                   other, and I am not for treating it in haste. I think it would
                                   not be out of the way to have the different resolutions on the
                                   subject printed and laid upon the tables of members of the
                                   Senate, so that we can act upon them with due and proper
                                   consideration. Whether they would be proper measures to be
                                   adopted, is a question that will come before the Senate for its
                                   consideration and investigation, and for that reason I think if
                                   there should be anything printed that comes before this body it
                                   should be these resolutions.
                              The motion to lay the resolutions on the table and make them the
                                   special order for Wednesday next, at 2 o'clock P. M.,
                                   was agreed to.
                         
                         
                              A MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE
                              was received from the hands of Hon. Cyrus T. Nixon, Clerk thereof,
                                   announcing the organization of that body, and that it was ready
                                   to proceed with legislative business.
                         
                         
                              REVISION OF THE RULES.
                              Mr. HUBBARD. I desire to offer the following resolution:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             Resolved, That a committee of five
                                                  be appointed by the Presiding Officer to revise
                                                  the rules of the Senate, and report as soon as
                                                  practicable.

                              Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I
                                   thank you for the honor of this election. In assuming the
                                   responsibility of this position I am fully mindful of the
                                   differences of opinion, and the seeming conflict of interests
                                   that exist. Conscientious differences of opinion are the natural
                                   outgrowth, the necessary result of free institutions. Their
                                   discussion is a measurement of reason, and are to be reconciled
                                   on this floor by courtesy in intercourse, decorum in debate and
                                   the observance of order. I ask of each of you, and shall rely,
                                   upon, your cordial co-operation to enable me to discharge every
                                   duty intelligently, faithfully and impartially.
                              The important subjects of legislation will be submitted to you by
                                   the Governor in his message. Your familiarity with these, and
                                   with the views of your constituency, will enable you to act with
                                   proper understanding.
                              Agriculturture, manufactures, mining and every other material
                                   interest is prosperous, and if further legislation is needed to
                                   advance that prosperity, it will be for you to enact that which
                                   may be adequate.
                              The system of education maintained by the State, whereby popular
                                   intelligence and public virtue, the fundamental principles, the
                                   elements of strength and security are promoted on the idea that
                                   every child in the State is a child of the State, is a primary,
                                   not a secondary interest that commends itself to patriotic pride,
                                   to support which the people of the State are more willing to be
                                   taxed than for any other purpose, that Indiana may not be behind
                                   any of her sister States.
                              The system of benevolence so freely and cheerfully maintained,
                                   whereby the blind are educated, a significant language is given
                                   to the dumb, and those who are so unfortunate as to be bereft of
                                   reason are tenderly cared for, because they can not care for
                                   themselves, and a home for the disabled soldier is
                                   providedcommands the benevolent admiration of humanity.
                              Whatever may be the result of your deliberations, I trust it will
                                   be to your honor, to the credit of the State and to the will and
                                   interest of those we represent.

                              The resolution was adopted.
                         
                         
                              RULES.
                              Mr. FURNAS submitted the following:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED. That the rules of the
                                                  last House of Representatives be adopted for the
                                                  government of this House till otherwise
                                                  ordered.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              The resolution was adopted.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN called for the reading again of the report of the vote
                                   of the election of Clerk. He understood that report was read 57
                                   to 43, one vote too much--the Representative from Warrick (Mr.
                                   Dial) not being present.
                              The reading of the record justified the remark.
                              The SPEAKER. The Clerk will make the correction of the record.
                              A message was received from the Senate, by their Secretary,
                                   announcing the organization of that body and its readiness to

                              RULES.
                              Mr. BUTTERWORTH submitted the following:

                                                  Librarian furnish the members of the House of
                                                  Representatives with the rules of the last session
                                                  if they are in print.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Mr. FURNAS. I understand that there are no copies of those rules in
                                   print.
                              The SPEAKER. I believe I have the only copy that remains. There may
                                   be one more.
                              The resolution was rejected.
                              Mr. OFFUTT submitted the following:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, That the rules adopted

                                                  others shall be legally adopted; and that a
                                                  special committee of five be appointed by the

                                                  Id on the second Tuesday in October, in the year

                                             WHEREAS, The foregoing joint
                                                  resolution was passed by the General Assembly of
                                                  the State of Indiana at its last preceding
                                                  session, begun in January, 1871, be it therefore
                                                  resolved by the General Assembly of Indiana, at
                                                  its present session, that said proposed amendment
                                                  to the Constitution of the State of Indiana be,
                                                  and the same is hereby agreed to, and that said
                                                  proposed amendment to the Constitution of the
                                                  State of Indiana be submitted to the electors of
                                                  the State of Indiana for their ratification or
                                                  rejection at the next general election to be held
                                                  on the second Tuesday in October, in the year of
                                                  our Lord one thousand eight hundred and
                                                  seventy-four.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              The joint resolution was read the first time, and ordered to be engrossed
                                   and entered upon the journal of the House of Representatives.
                              The SPEAKER. The question now recurs on the passage of the joint
                                   resolution.
                              The roll call for the vote was ordered and proceeded.
                              Mr. FURNAS. Does that include the unsurrendered bonds?
                              Mr. SHIRLEY. It applies to the bonds set forth in the acts referred
                                   to.
                              Several voices demanded the reading of the resolution, and it was
                                   again read by the Clerk.
                              Mr. HARDESTY. I move its reference to a special committee of three.
                                   It is a subject that requires very careful attention.
                              Mr. GIFFORD thought it would be more proper to refer the resolution
                                   to the appropriate standing committee.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN submitted the point of order, that it is too late now
                                   to make amendments to the proposition, which the reference might
                                   presuppose, as the call of the roll had already been
                                   commenced.
                              The SPEAKER overruled the point. The reading of the proposition
                                   reopens the question.
                              Mr. WALKER moved that the joint resolution be laid on the
                                   table.
                              Messrs. RICHARDSON and CLINE demanded the yeas and nays on this
                                   motion.
                              The yeas and nays were ordered, and being taken, the result
                                   was--yeas 45, nays 54--as follows:

                                                  Willard, Wolflin, Woollen and Wood--54.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Messrs. Furnas, Gifford, Glazebrook, Hollinsworth, Johnson and
                                   others explaining their affirmative votes--generally because,
                                   whilst they were in favor of the proposition, they desired simply
                                   to gain time for a just examination of it.
                              So the motion to lay on the table was rejected.
                              The SPEAKER. The question recurs on the motion [Mr.
                                   Hardesty's] to refer the joint resolution to a select
                                   committee.
                              Mr. GIVEN. I move to amend the motion so that the joint resolution
                                   shall be referred to a special committee of one from each
                                   Congressional district.
                              The amendment was agreed to, and the motion of Mr. Hardesty as
                                   amended was adopted.
                              A message was received from the Senate announcing the appointment
                                   by that body of Messrs. Dodge and Fuller as a committee to act
                                   with a like committee of the House in waiting upon the
                                   Governor.
                         
                         
                              THE ORGANIZING OFFICERS.
                              Mr. KIMBALL submitted a resolution for an order that Samuel W.
                                   Holmes be allowed five days' pay and mileage for his
                                   services in the organization of this House.
                              Mr. HARDESTY proposed to amend the order so that it shall include
                                   the Principal Clerk, the Assistant Clerk and the Doorkeeper of
                                   the last House.
                              Mr. Kimball accepted the amendment, and so the order was
                                   adopted.
                              On motion of Mr. BRANHAM the House adjourned.

                         IN SENATE.
                         
                              THURSDAY, November 14, 1872.
                         
                         The PRESIDENT [Hon. George W. Friedley] called the Senate to order at
                              two o'clock p. m.
                         
                              A MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE,
                              inviting the Senate to the Hall of the House of Representatives to
                                   hear the Governor's message, was received.
                              On motion of Mr. ORR the message from the House was taken up.
                              On his further motion the invitation contained therein was
                                   accepted.
                         
                         
                              THE WABASH AND ERIE CANAL.
                              Mr. BROWN asked and obtained leave to introduce the following:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             Resolved by the General Assembly of the
                                                  State of Indiana, That the following
                                                  amendment be proposed to the Constitution of
                                                  Indiana:
                                             No law or resolution shall be passed by the General
                                                  Assembly of the State of Indiana that shall
                                                  recognize any liability of the State to pay or
                                                  redeem any certificate of stock issued in
                                                  pursuance of an act entitled "An Act to
                                                  provide for the funded debt of the State of
                                                  Indiana and for the completion of the Wabash and
                                                  Erie Canal to Evansville," passed January
                                                  19, 1846, and an act supplemental to said act,
                                                  passed January 29, 1847, which, by the provisions
                                                  of said act, or either of them, shall be payable
                                                  exclusively from the proceeds of the canal lands
                                                  and the toils and revenues of the canal in said
                                                  acts mentioned, and no such, certificates or
                                                  stocks shall ever be paid by the State.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Mr. BROWN. This is the same resolution which was passed by both
                                   branches of the General Assembly last session. Under a provision
                                   of the Constitution of the State it must be passed by some
                                   subsequent General Assembly of the State and then ratified by the
                                   people of the State at the ballot box. In my judgment, the
                                   resolution can be passed as well by a special session as a
                                   general or regular session of this existing General Assembly, but
                                   inasmuch as there is some doubt upon the subject, I move that the
                                   resolution be referred to the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary to examine and report upon.
                              There being no objection it was so ordered.
                         
                         
                              THE GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE.
                              Mr. WADGE. In view of the fact that the Governor has indicated two
                                   o'clock as the hour in which he will be prepared to
                                   deliver his message, I move that the reading of the minutes be
                                   dispensed with and that the Senate repair at once to the Hall of
                                   the House.
                              Mr. BROWN. I think we had better read the minutes, because they are
                                   very important They refer to the organization of the body, and we
                                   should see that there is no mistake in them. They, however, might
                                   be passed over to be read tomorrow.
                              Mr, WADGE. They might be read after we come back from the Hall of
                                   the House.
                              The PRESIDENT. It is moved and seconded that we proceed to the Hall
                                   of the House of Representatives to hear such communication as the
                                   Governor may see proper to make.
                              The motion was agreed to, and--
                              Accordingly Senators left their chamber for the purpose indicated
                                   in the motion.
                              
                              When they had returned--
                              The PRESIDENT directed the reading of the Secretary's
                                   journal of yesterday's proceedings.
                              Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Scott, asked and obtained leave of absence till
                                   Monday on account of sickness in his family.
                              The journal of yesterday was then read, corrected and approved.
                         
                         
                              THE DRAINAGE LAWS.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS introduced a bill [S. 1] for an act to repeal an act
                                   entitled "An Act to authorize the construction of
                                   levees, dykes and drains, and the reclamation of wet and
                                   overflowed lands by incorporated companies and repeal all former
                                   laws regulating the same subject," which act took effect
                                   without executive approval on the 29th day of May, 1869 ; also an
                                   act to repeal an act entitled "An Act supplementary to
                                   an act entitled 'An Act to authorize and encourage the
                                   construction of levees, dykes and drains, and the reclamation of
                                   wet and overflowed lands by incorporated companies and to repeal
                                   all former laws relating to the same subject,' which act
                                   took effect May 22, 1869, and prescribing penalties for violation
                                   of the provisions thereof," which last named act was
                                   approved on the 23d day of February, 1871.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved that the rules be suspended so that the bill may
                                   be read the second time now and referred to the Senators
                                   interested, viz: Messrs. Wadge, Hubbard, Winterbotham and
                                   himself.
                              Mr. BROWN. I think we had better not be in a hurry in shoving this
                                   bill through. I was in favor of the drainage companies last
                                   session, but I am inclined to think i was wrong about it.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS, The reason I ask for a suspension of the
                                   constitutional provision is, that the Senate may adjourn over
                                   this afternoon or to-morrow afternoon until Monday, and the
                                   Senators referred to will probably remain in the city, when they
                                   can consider it, after which the bill can be reported to the
                                   Senate and be discussed here.
                              Mr. HUBBARD. As this matter has been very thoroughly discussed, not
                                   only in the Senate last session, but since that time by the
                                   public press, of course every member of the Senate understands
                                   the in-interests of the northern members in the passage of a
                                   repealing act. I do not exaggerate, I think, when I state that in
                                   the different counties affected by the work of the Kankakee
                                   Draining Company there rre somewhere between 500 and 1,000
                                   different cases pending in the courts. I think, in most
                                   instances, these cases will be called for trial during the coming
                                   winter. This bill, of course, can have no influence upon any
                                   pending litigation, but as the matter is one that excites great
                                   interest in the northern section of the State, we feel justified
                                   in using every reasonable means to bring this bill to a
                                   successful passage, and for this reason I must sustain my friend,
                                   the Senator from Jasper [Mr. Dwiggins], in asking that this
                                   matter be pushed on now that it may be brought to a successful
                                   termination at as early a period in the session as possible.
                              Mr. BROWN. While I am in favor of the repeal of the law referred
                                   to, I am opposed to making a precedent such as is proposed. It
                                   seems to me better to have this bill pass along in the way and
                                   manner which the constitution has provided. Mr. B. said the
                                   course proposed by the Senator from Jasper [Mr. Dwiggins] was
                                   unheard of in parliamentary proceedings, he [Mr. B.] was disposed
                                   to vote for the bill, but when a Senator came in the second day
                                   of the session and introduced a bill to repeal two laws on the
                                   statute books under which rights had been acquired, and without
                                   permitting it to take the course of fair legislation, sought to
                                   place it in the hands of Senators who were at war with the
                                   company, he must object. He thought no harm could result by
                                   having the bill pass along in the ordinary course of
                                   legislation.
                              Mr. WADGE directed attention to a precedent established in the
                                   Senate on the second day of the last session of the General
                                   Assembly and reported on page 28 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS, volume XII, which he read. The bill then
                                   introduced was read the second time by consent of the
                                   Senate--two-thirds voting in the affirmative--as the Senator from
                                   Jasper [Mr. Dwiggins] asks the consent of the Senate to do now.
                                   As the Senator from St. Joseph [Mr. Hubbard] has intimated,
                                   perhaps not ten Senators on this floor understand the operation
                                   of this drainage law. The matter has been discussed on the floor
                                   of the Senate and all over the State, but I presume there are few
                                   Senators who fully understand it. I do hope the motion of the
                                   Senator from Jasper will prevail.
                              Mr. BROWN. Fair and just legislation means that when a bill goes
                                   into the hands of a committee it should be an impartial
                                   committeea committee whose judgments are not biased or prejudiced
                                   either for or against it.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS. Of course I expect the Senator [Mr. Brown] to vote
                                   for this bill, and I will withdraw that part of my motion
                                   requesting the bill to be sent to the Senators named, and move only
                                   that the Senate suspend the rules so that the bill may be read
                                   the second time now by title.
                              The motion was agreed to by yeas 45, nays 2, and the bill was read
                                   the second time by title only.
                              It goes upon the files and will be referred to the appropriate
                                   committee after the standing committees shall be appointed.
                         
                         
                              BANKS OF DISCOUNT.
                              Mr. DAUGHERTY, by leave, introduced a bill [S. 2] to authorize and
                                   regulate the incorporation of Banks of Discount and Deposit in
                                   the State of Indiana, which was read the first time and passed to
                                   the second reading.
                              [The bill provides that any number of persons, not less than five,
                                   may form themselves into a corporation as a tank of discount and
                                   deposit. It contains, among other provisions, the following: The

                                   no business other than that necessary for its preliminary
                                   organization until at least fifty per cent. of the whole capital
                                   stock has been actually paid in, and the certificate of the fact
                                   filed in the office of the Secretary of State ; no such
                                   association shall issue bills of indebtedness in the form and
                                   similitude of bank notes intended to circulate as currency; each
                                   director must have at least five shares of stock; at least fifty
                                   per cent, of the capital stock must be paid in before commencing
                                   business, and the residue shall be paid in within six months
                                   thereafter; the capital stock shall be held as personal property;
                                   it may be increased by a vote of the shareholders owning
                                   two-thirds of its capital, but such increase shall be paid in at
                                   the time it is subscribed; ten per cent, of the net profits of
                                   the business of the association shall be retained as a surplus

                                   stock; dividends may be declared semi-annually, but no portion of
                                   the capital stock shall be withdrawn, and if losses have been
                                   sustained exceeding its undivided profits, no dividends shall be
                                   made while it shall continue its banking operations greater than

                                                  dam at Blue Island, in that State, whereby the
                                                  waters of the Calumet River were dammed up so at
                                                  to overflow large quantities of valuable lands in

                              Mr. ORR. I have had the pleasure of an acquaintance with John W.
                                   Burson for something like ten or fifteen years, and I have always
                                   found him to be a gentleman of the first order, honest and
                                   honorable in all his
                                   dealings. He had a big, kind, generous heart, and no charitable
                                   or benevolent institution ever applied to him in vain. He was
                                   liberal. No religious society, of whatever denomination it might
                                   be, asked him for aid and was refused. He also, sir, loved his
                                   country. When our country was involved in that terrible struggle,
                                   which has passed, he was always found, in the language of the
                                   resolution, an incorruptible patriot. He loved the soldier and
                                   was always ready to help him, and he loved the soldier's
                                   friend; but, Mr. President, he has gone to his eternal rest, I
                                   hope, in heaven.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE. In moving to adopt these resolutions, I do not like
                                   to let the opportunity pass without at least saying a word. My
                                   acquaintance with Mr. Burson was of a limited character, but in
                                   the short time of our acquaintance I found him to be one of that
                                   class of men that belongs to the noblest work of God--a man whose
                                   character I consider irreproachable--a man whose generosity was
                                   unbounded. His devotion to his country, judging from the history
                                   I have of him from his neighbors, was of a character that stamped
                                   him as a man of the highest order. As far as I have been
                                   informed, his associations with his fellow men were of the first
                                   standing, as a kind husband, an indulgent parent, and one of the
                                   best citizens of the commonwealth.
                              The PRESIDENT. Those in favor of the adoption of the resolutions
                                   will please say "Aye."
                              After the affirmative response--
                              Mr. WILLIAMS said: I understand that these resolutions purport to
                                   say that John W. Burson was a Senator in this body. Now, sir, I
                                   have some respect for the memory of John W. Burson, but I am not
                                   willing to say that John W. Burson was a member of this Senate.
                                   The records of the Senate do not show it. If the Senate desire to
                                   pass resolutions in memory of John W. Burson as a citizen and a
                                   gentleman, I am willing it should pass them, but I am not willing
                                   to say that I contradict what was done in the Senate two years
                                   ago, and admit now that John W. Burson was a member of this body.
                                   Therefore, I offer the following amendment: Strike out the words
                                   that refer to him as a member of this body. If that is done I am
                                   willing to vote for the resolutions.
                              The PRESIDENT. I believe the amendment is out of order, as the
                                   affirmative vote had been taken at the time the Senator from Knox
                                   [Mr. Williams] arose.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS. Will the chair say that a Senator has not the right
                                   to rise and interpose a motion before a vote is announced by the
                                   presiding officer?
                              The PRESIDENT. The chair understands that it is too late after an
                                   affirmative vote has been taken, to offer an amendment to the
                                   proposition being voted on.
                              Mr. GLESSNER. I understand the rule to be that at any time before
                                   the decision of the chair is announced a motion to amend can be
                                   made. The Senator [Mr. Williams] moves to amend, and I understand
                                   under the rule his motion is in time.
                              The PRESIDENT. As many as are of a contrary opinion will say
                                   "No." [After the negative response]--The
                                   resolutions are adopted.

                                             RESOLVED, That the Doorkeeper be
                                                  requested to obtain of the State Librarian and lay
                                                  upon the tables of Senators one copy of the
                                                  Revised Statutes, one copy of the laws passed by
                                                  the last General Assembly, one copy each of the
                                                  Senate and House journals, and one copy of the
                                                  BREVIER REPORTS.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Mr. BROWN moved to amend by striking out the words "State
                                   Librarian," and inserting in lieu thereof the words
                                   "Secretary of State."
                              The amendment was taken by consent.
                              Mr. NEFF. I offer the following resolution as a substitute for the
                                   one just read:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, That the State
                                                  Librarian furnish each Senator with a copy of
                                                  Gavin & Hord's Statutes, the
                                                  Journals, Session Acts and BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS of the last session, and
                                                  that members so receiving shall receipt for the
                                                  same, and at the close of the session shall return
                                                  such copies of the Statutes, Journals, Session
                                                  Acts and BREVIER REPORTS and take up his receipt for the same,
                                                  and in default thereof shall have deducted from
                                                  his pay in settlement with the State Treasury the
                                                  value of such books so receipted for at the list
                                                  prices.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              On motion of Mr. DITTEMORE the substitute was laid on the
                                   table.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS moved to insert in lieu of the word
                                   "revised" before the word
                                   "statutes," the words "Gavin &
                                   Hord."
                              Mr. HAWORTH accepted the amendment.
                              The resolution, as amended, was adopted, nem
                                   con.

                                   association, made in pursuance of the act passed and approved
                                   March 15, 1867. If no such sworn statement is made, the Auditor
                                   shall furnish any information he may have in regard to the
                                   stockholders of such bank and the number of shares held by each,
                                   and the stockholders shall be taxed upon the shares of bank stock
                                   held by each for municipal purposes, according to the rate
                                   chargeable on other personal property. The President, cashier, or
                                   other proper officer may pay such taxes and charge the amount
                                   against the stockholders, which may be deducted from any dividend
                                   on such stock as may be declared thereon. Taxes assessed upon
                                   shares of bank stock shall be a lien on said stock until payment,
                                   and shall attach on the first day of each May for which the
                                   assessment is made. The value of real estate in which the capital
                                   of a bank is invested shall be deducted from the cash value of
                                   the shares.]
                              It was read the first time and passed to the second reading.

                              Mr. BROWN offered a resolution authorizing the Doorkeeper to
                                   contract for five copies of the Daily Journal
                                   and five copies of the Daily Sentinel, for each
                                   Senatorfour copies of each day's paper to be enveloped
                                   and stamped.
                              Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN moved to amend by adding one copy of the Daily Telegraph, and six copies of the Weekly Volksblatt, to be enveloped and
                                   stamped.
                              Mr. BROWN accepted the amendment.
                              Mr. NEFF moved to further amend by inserting
                                   "two" copies of the dailies instead of
                                   "five."
                              On motion of Mr. BROWN the amendment was laid on the table.
                              Mr. THOMPSON. I am requested to move to amend by adding the Saturday Evening Mirror, a weekly paper
                                   published in the interests of the colored population.
                                   [Laughter.]
                              Mr. BROWN. The Senator from Owen desires to me ask if that is a
                                   Greeley paper?
                              Mr. THOMPSON. The wrong paper has been laid on my desk. It is the
                                        National Beacon, published in the
                                   interests of the colored population of this city and State. I am
                                   requested to move that the resolution be amended so as to embrace
                                   six copies of this
                              Mr. BROWN accepted the amendment.
                              Mr. BEESON submitted the following substitute for the pending
                                   resolution:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, That a committee of
                                                  five be appointed by the President to fix the
                                                  amount to be allowed each member for paper,
                                                  stationery, &c.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Mr. BROWN. I see no necessity for this subject being embraced in
                                   that resolution; that has reference to stationery more
                                   particularly. I think we might as well pass this resolution. I
                                   suppose we can tell how many newspapers we want as well as a
                                   committee.
                              Mr. BEESON. I have found in my experience here that the paper
                                   question is one of the most vexed questions we have to meet. For
                                   several terms the whole matter has been referred to a committee,
                                   and this resolution includes the amount of stationery as
                                   well.
                              Mr. BROWN. I will withdraw my resolution, and let the whole matter
                                   go under the resolution of the Senator [Mr. Beeson].
                              The substitute [Mr. Beeson's] was adopted.
                              The PRESIDENT subsequently made this committee to consist of
                                   Messrs. Beeson, Brown, Dittemore, Rhodes and Hall.
                         
                         
                              RAILROAD AID STOCK.
                              Mr. TAYLOR asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill [S. 5] for
                                   an act to require railroad companies to issue stock paid for by
                                   taxes voted in aid of the construction of railroads to taxpayers
                                   or their assignees, and to issue unclaimed stock for the benefit
                                   of the common school fund, which was read the first time and
                                   passed to the second reading.
                         
                         
                              LOCKS FOR DESKS.
                              Mr. WADGE offered the following:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             BE IT RESOLVED, That the State Librarian be
                                                  instructed to see that secure locks be put on the
                                                  drawers in the desks of Senators, and that the
                                                  Doorkeeper be instructed to exercise diligence in
                                                  preventing articles being extracted therefrom.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              It was adopted by consent.
                         
                         
                              PAY TO EMPLOYES.
                              Mr. THOMPSON offered the following:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, That J. W. Cookerly be
                                                  allowed five days' pay and mileage for
                                                  his services as Doorkeeper in the organization of
                                                  the Senate, and that the President pro tem. be
                                                  authorized to draw his warrant on the Auditor of
                                                  State for that amount, to be paid out of any money
                                                  hereafter appropriated for legislative
                                                  purposes.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Mr. DWIGGINS. I move that it be referred to a committee of three,

                                   which committee shall ascertain and report the amount due each of

                              Under the foregoing order for chaplain service the members of the
                                   convention now rose, and the Rev. J. P. E. Kumler, pastor of the
                                   First Presbyterian Church of this city, said the prayers,
                                   standing at the right of the President.
                              The PRESIDENT of the Senate. If it is the pleasure of the
                                   convention, the body will now hear the message of the
                                   Governor.
                              Whereupon, His Excellency, Governor Baker, ascended the dais, and
                                   standing at the Speaker's table he read his first
                                   special message. [See Appendix.]

                                                  To the Governor of the State of
                                                  Indiana.
                                             
                                             In anticipation of our annual report, to be made up
                                                  to the close of the present year, the
                                                  Commissioners of the House of Refuge for Juvenile
                                                  Offenders beg leave to present to you and the
                                                  General Assembly, the following facts and
                                                  suggestions. The General Assembly of 1869
                                                  appropriated $30,000 per annum for the current
                                                  expenses of this institution, including the
                                                  salaries of its officers. It also enacted
                                                  "that whenever there shall be a failure
                                                  at any regular biennial session of the General
                                                  Assembly to pass an appropriation bill for this
                                                  object, it shall be lawful for the Governor,
                                                  Secretary and Treasurer of State to direct the
                                                  Auditor of the State to draw warrants on the State
                                                  Treasury for an amount not exceeding the last
                                                  appropriation." At the time these laws
                                                  were passed there were 118 inmates in the
                                                  institution. An appropriation having been made at
                                                  the same time for an increase in the buildings of
                                                  the institution, one main building and one family
                                                  house had been completed, and were ready for
                                                  occupancy before the 1st of January, 1871. The
                                                  great pressure of boys who were legally committed
                                                  to theinstitution, many of whom were in prison,,
                                                  led the Commissioners to authorize their reception
                                                  into the institution as soon as the houses were
                                                  done, with the expectation that the General
                                                  Assembly of 1871 would make the neccessary
                                                  appropriation for their support. No appropriations
                                                  were, however, made by that General Assembly, and
                                                  we were left without any means whatever for the
                                                  support of the institution from January 1 to April
                                                  1, 1871, the appropriation for the year having all
                                                  been exhausted before the 1st of January, 1871. We
                                                  were thus left with a family of 220 to support
                                                  upon the sum appropriated when it reached only
                                                  118. It did not seem to us expedient to discharge
                                                  upon the community unreformed boys, and as other
                                                  boys were being constantly committed, we have
                                                  thought best, since, to receive some of them,
                                                  especially from counties not represented in the
                                                  institution, as places were made vacant by the
                                                  discharge of boys on the ground of reformation.
                                                  The institution has thus been kept full to its
                                                  utmost capacity up to the present time, and there
                                                  are now 200 boys in it. To meet the extra expense
                                                  over the amount of appropriation we have been
                                                  compelled to resort to the use of credit in our
                                                  purchases, and especially to a loan. This loan now
                                                  amounts to $18,831 62, and the other indebtedness
                                                  of the institution will reach $3,500.
                                             For these we would respectfully but earnestly ask
                                                  that an appropriation may be made, as well as of a
                                                  sum sufficient to pay the current expenses of the
                                                  institution up to the first of April next, the
                                                  termination of our fiscal year, which expenses we
                                                  estimate at $4,000. We would also respectfully
                                                  suggest some modification of the present laws,
                                                  especially one applying the amount received from
                                                  the counties directly to the support of the
                                                  institution, instead of placing it in the State
                                                  Treasury as heretofore. Experience has also taught
                                                  us that boys of eighteen years are too old for
                                                  such an institution as ours, more especially,
                                                  since not unfrequently, by misrepresenting their
                                                  age, boys much beyond that procure admission in
                                                  preference to being sent to the State Prison. The
                                                  discipline to be applied to such as these should
                                                  be more severe than is requisite for younger boys;
                                                  hence, we suggest that the limit be reduced to
                                                  sixteen years of age. The institution has been
                                                  eminently successful in accomplishing the object
                                                  of its erection, and a very large portion of the
                                                  boys, 150 in number, who have been discharged, are
                                                  doing well. We are not surprised that there should
                                                  be some exceptions, and that a few of our boys should be
                                                  found in the State Prison, as it would be
                                                  impracticable permanently to reform every boy sent
                                                  here. Whilst we endeavor to see that all the boys
                                                  discharged are provided with suitable homes, it
                                                  sometimes happens that they soon reach an age
                                                  which leaves them without restraint, and being
                                                  surrounded by evil influences, they find their old
                                                  associates, and return to the haunts of
                                                  wickedness. But notwithstanding some such cases
                                                  have occurred, far the larger portion are returned
                                                  to the community to make useful citizens and fill
                                                  their post in the duties of life. We have been
                                                  compelled to decline, for want of room, more than
                                                  one hundred and fifty boys who have been regularly
                                                  committed to our care. Some of these are sent to
                                                  the State Prison, others to the County Jails, and
                                                  others still are turned loose on the community, to
                                                  enter again on a life of crime, or become a charge
                                                  upon the public.
                                             We are fully satisfied, as a matter of public
                                                  economy, as well as for the public good, an
                                                  appropriation should be made for an increase of
                                                  buildings, to an amount not less than $15,000.
                                             All of which is respectfully submitted.

                                                  Baker, Governor of Indiana: SIR:
                                             
                                              I transmit herewith a copy of a treaty concluded in
                                                  this city on the 8th day of May last, between the
                                                  United States and Great Britain. By the 27th
                                                  Article, the Government of the Dominion of Canada
                                                  engages to secure to the citizens of the United
                                                  States the use of the Welland, St. Lawrence and
                                                  other canals in the Dominion on terms of equality
                                                  with the inhabitants of the Dominion, and the
                                                  Government of the United States engages to urge
                                                  upon the State Governments to secure to the
                                                  subjects of her Brittannic Majesty the use of the
                                                  several State canals connected with the navigation
                                                  of the lakes or rivers traversed by or contiguous
                                                  to the boundary line between the possessions of
                                                  the High Contracting parties, on terms of equality
                                                  with the inhabitants of the United States.
                                             The wisdom and the importance of these reciprocal
                                                  connections of the use of the artificial channels
                                                  of water communication contemplated by the treaty
                                                  on terms of equality to the citizens or subjects
                                                  of either power are apparent. The rapid increase
                                                  of population and of production of the vast
                                                  territory on either side of the boundary line and
                                                  on the upper lakes, demands all the channels of
                                                  communication with the tide waters, which either
                                                  nature or the enterprise of man has made
                                                  available. It is confidently believed that the use
                                                  of the artificial water communications which the
                                                  treaty contemplates will contribute to a rapid
                                                  increase of trade, through those several channels,
                                                  and will tend to a consequent increase in the
                                                  tolls and returns of profits, both direct and
                                                  indirect, to each and all of the canals thus open
                                                  to the use of a larger extent of country. As the
                                                  period is approaching when the Legislature of your
                                                  State is about to convene, I desire to bring the
                                                  provisions of this article of the treaty to its
                                                  notice, and to urge upon your State Government to
                                                  secure the subjects of her Britannic Majesty the
                                                  use of the several State canals within the State
                                                  of Indiana, connected with the navigation of lakes
                                                  or rivers, traversed by or contiguous to the
                                                  boundary line between the possessions of the
                                                  United States and those of Her Britannic Majesty
                                                  in North America, on terms of equality with the
                                                  inhabitants of the United States. I address a
                                                  similar request to other States, through which are
                                                  constructed canals connected with the navigation
                                                  of the lakes. I have the honor to be, etc,
                                                  etc.,

                                                  To the Governor of Indiana
                                                  : DEAR SIR--
                                             
                                             We herewith transmit to you a special report from
                                                  the Warden of the financial condition of this
                                                  Prison. And through you we would respectfully ask
                                                  from the Legislature an immediate appropriation
                                                  for the payment of the various sums of
                                                  indebtedness therein stated. The necessities which
                                                  led to the creation of these liabilities have been
                                                  set forth in former reports, and the interest
                                                  required to carry this indebtedness bears heavily
                                                  on our income. The repairs and alterations
                                                  suggested seem to us imperatively required by a
                                                  due regard to the public interests. Indeed, the
                                                  state of the Prison is such that it would be good
                                                  economy in the Legislature to authorize a general
                                                  renovation. If this is much longer neglected
                                                  either a much larger sum will be required to put
                                                  it in order, or steps must be taken for the
                                                  erection of a new establishment. It is believed
                                                  that the sum asked for by the Warden, with a small
                                                  sum for miscellaneous repairs each year, will
                                                  answer until the end of the present contracts,
                                                  when the State will have to take decided steps
                                                  toward renovation. It will be seen that the Warden
                                                  gives an estimate of the probable receipts and
                                                  expenditures during the next two years This
                                                  estimate is believed to be reliable. Heretofore
                                                  for many years no appropriations have been made
                                                  for current expenses, but the income of the prison
                                                  has been applied at the discretion ot the
                                                  managers. We believe the law requires an
                                                  appropriation, and that there is no authority to
                                                  draw money for any purpose without. We would
                                                  respectfully call attention to the fact that the
                                                  salaries paid the Warden, Deputy Warden, Clerk and
                                                  Chaplain were fixed many years ago, when the cost
                                                  of living was much less than now, and that they
                                                  should be increased. If the Legislature, at its
                                                  special session, shall propose any general
                                                  revision of the prison laws, we will be pleased to
                                                  give any information, as suggested by our
                                                  experience, if called on to do so. All of which is
                                                  respectfully submitted.
                                             
                                                  R. S. HEISKELL, W. W. CURRY,

                                                  INDIANA STATE PRISON SOUTH,
                                                  JEFFERSONVILLE,
                                                  
                                                  October 18.
                                                  
                                             
                                        
                                   
                              
                         
                         
                               REPORT OF THE WARDEN.
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             
                                                  To the Board of Directors
                                                  :
                                             
                                             In view of the fact that the Governor has called an
                                                  extra session of the Legislature, to which he will
                                                  desire to submit a statement of the condition of
                                                  this institution, I hand you this statement of its
                                                  financial affairs: The total receipts of the
                                                  prison for the current year ending December 15,
                                                  next, will be about $60,000. The current expenses
                                                  for running the institution about $55,000, showing
                                                  a surplus of $5,000 to be applied on former
                                                  indebtedness; and giving evidence that at the
                                                  price of the present contracts the prison will
                                                  more than meet its ordinary expenses. By referring
                                                  to former reports, it will be seen that our
                                                  indebtedness at the close of the last year was
                                                  then $12,020 55. But this was based on an estimate
                                                  of losses which have not been realized. There
                                                  remain claims of $1,716 60 against Hopkins
                                                  & Stanton and A. W. Hall & Co.,
                                                  which have not been collected, and are not likely
                                                  to be; adding this to the debt of last year, and
                                                  subtracting the surplus of this, we have a debt
                                                  for the close of this year of $8,737 15. In
                                                  addition to this there is an indebtedness of
                                                  $10,000 on account of the alterations and repairs,
                                                  including the fence, to adapt the premises to the
                                                  use of the car company, under present contracts;
                                                  and that $12,000 furnished by the Governor to
                                                  repair damages of the fire; an entire obligation
                                                  of over thirty thousand dollars to be provided
                                                  for. I am compelled in every report to call
                                                  attention to the general state of dilapidation of
                                                  the premises, constituting a continual bill of
                                                  expenses. In consequence of having no
                                                  appropriations for repairs for the last two years
                                                  this has borne heavily on our friends, so that
                                                  only temporary expedients could be resorted to.
                                                  The condition of the roofs of the cell houses and
                                                  shops is such as to absolutely require
                                                  re-covering, and this can not be done without
                                                  considerable expense. There are by actual
                                                  measurement 76
                                                  1/2 squares, which can not be tinned at present
                                                  prices for less than $1,000. The annual
                                                  appropriations for several years past have been
                                                  largely absorbed in patching up these roofs, and
                                                  it will be sound economy to replace them with new
                                                  material at once. It is hoped in a few months the
                                                  females will be removed to the new Reformatory,
                                                  and then it will be advisable to make some
                                                  alterations.
                                             The present female wards could be converted into
                                                  wards for insane prisoners, of which we have
                                                  several, who ought to be separated from the body
                                                  of convicts, both for safety and moral effect. To
                                                  do this, and fit up about twenty new cells on the
                                                  north side of this wing, will cost about $3,000.
                                                  One of the heaviest bills we are called upon to
                                                  meet is that for fuel and lights. Our gas is
                                                  supplied by the City Gas Works, and our heating is
                                                  mainly by stoves. The annual cost of these two
                                                  items is about $3,600. I am satisfied from careful
                                                  estimates that the apparatus to make our own gas,
                                                  and to heat by steam could be put in for about
                                                  $4,000, and that we should hereby save one-half of
                                                  our annual bill for fuel and light. The houses

                                                  would respectfully ask for $1,500 as actually
                                                  required for this purpose. According to law, it is
                                                  the duty of the Legislature to make the neccessary
                                                  appropriations for the current expenses of the
                                                  prison. To enable it to do this intelligently the
                                                  following estimates are furnished for the next two
                                                  years: Average number of convicts, 400; of this
                                                  number the daily average on contract will be about
                                                  330, the remainder being in hospital, laboring for

                                                  provision, $22,000; clothing, $7,000; fuel and
                                                  lights, $3.600; gate money to discharged convicts,
                                                  $2,250; library, $500; escaped convicts, $500;

                                                  This estimate leaves a surplus of $4.230 for each
                                                  of the next two years, which will pay off all

                                                  running expenses during the last four years.
                                             To recapitulate there will be needed $30,737 to meet
                                                  all past deficiences, including the fire; $18,000
                                                  for necessary repairs and improvements, and
                                                  $58,650 for annual expenses; and there is
                                                  reasonable certainty of an annual income of

                                                  an appropriation, equal to the aggregate of two
                                                  cents for each inhabitant of the State, be made
                                                  toward defraying the expenses of erecting upon the

                                                  patriotism of our soldiers and sailors in a manner
                                                  creditable to the liberality of the State

                              The PRESIDENT of the Senate. The purpose for which the General
                                   Assembly was convened having been accomplished, I pronounce this
                                   Convention adjourned without day.
                              The Senators and officers of the Senate then retired from the
                                   Hall.
                              The SPEAKER again called the House to order.
                              Mr. BAKER submitted the following, which was adopted:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, That the message of the
                                                  Governor be referred to the committee of the whole
                                                  House, and made the special order of the day, for
                                                  Monday next at three o'clock p. m.
                                        
                                   
                              
                         
                         
                              U. S. SENATOR ELECTION.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. I wish to call the attention of the House to the law
                                   in relation to the election of United States Senators. I will
                                   send it up to the Clerk for the purpose of having the particular
                                   section read which provides for the time of that election.
                              The Clerk read the section indicated.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. That shows clearly that our election of the next
                                   United States Senator for Indiana must be held on Tuesday
                                   week.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN considered the reading wholly unnecessary. Gentlemen
                                   read the law.
                         
                         
                              WILLIAM M. MERWIN AND OTHERS.
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE submitted the following:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, That Wm. M. Merwin, C.
                                                  S. McDonald and D. H. Long be each allowed two
                                                  days pay at five dollars per day for services
                                                  rendered in the House of Representatives to be
                                                  paid out of any monies appropriated for
                                                  legislative expenses.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              The SPEAKER observed, that there was no appreciable affirmative
                                   vote on the passage of the resolution.
                              Mr. FURNAS. I presume that there are other gentlemen who, like
                                   myself, feel some hesitancy in acting on that resolutionbecause
                                   they may not know these gentlemen. I do not know Mr. Long. And
                                   there is another gentleman, an officer of the House of the last
                                   session who has been assisting in this organization, whom I would
                                   be glad to see compensated. I would be glad for all these
                                   gentlemen to receive the proper remuneration. I presume it is all
                                   right, but this is the reason I did not vote.
                              Mr. HELLER referred to the resolutions for ordering such
                                   compensation which have been already passed by the House.
                              The resolution was referred to the committee on
                                        employes.
                         
                         
                              NEWSPAPERS.
                              Mr. WOLFLIN submitted the following:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, That each member of the
                                                  House of Representatives be furnished with two
                                                  copies of the Daily Journal, one
                                                  copy of the Daily State
                                                  Sentinel, one copy of the Daily
                                                  Telegraph, and one copy of the Weekly Volksblat.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE proposed to amend the order by making it two copies
                                   of the Daily Sentinel instead of one copy; and
                                   by adding: "one copy of the Evening
                                        News."
                              Mr. FURNAS did not see the necessity of taking any but the papers
                                   representing the two political parties, and one paper printed in
                                   German out of respect to our German population.
                              Mr. LEE proposed to amend by adding: "One copy of the Evening Journal"
                              The amendment was accepted.
                              Mr. BRANHAM moved to lay the resolution and the proposed amendments
                                   on the table.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN made the point that there is an order of the House
                                   requiring all such resolutions as this to be referred to the
                                        special committee on employees without
                                   debate.
                              The SPEAKER sustained the point of order, and the propositions were
                                   accordingly referred.
                              Mr. LENFESTY submitted the following:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, That the time of the
                                                  daily meeting of the House till further orders
                                                  shall be 9 1/2 o'clock, A. M. instead of
                                                  9 A. M.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              The resolution was rejected.
                         
                         
                              INDIANA CENTENNIAL ASSOCIATION.
                              Mr. KIMBALL introduced a bill [H. R. 6] for an act creating the
                                   Indiana Centennial Association.
                              
                              Mr. GIVAN introduced a bill [H. R. 7] for an act providing that
                                   Justices of the Peace shall have exclusive jurisdiction of
                                   certain cases of misdemeanor, and repealing all acts conflicting
                                   therewith. [All cases of misdemeanor punishable by fine not
                                   exceeding twenty-five dollars.]
                              These bills were read the first time and ordered to the second
                                   reading.
                         
                         
                              WABASH AND ERIE CANAL.
                              The SPEAKER announced the special committee to consider Mr.
                                   Shirley's joint resolution for amendment of the State
                                   Constitution so as to prohibit legislation for the payment of the
                                   debt charged upon the Wabash and Erie Canal, viz.: Messrs
                                   Whitworth, Woodard, Miller, Walker, Shirley, Offutt, Richardson,
                                   Hardesty, (Chairman), Mellett, Thayer and Butterworth.
                              Mr. KIMBALL submitted a joint resolution agreeing to and adopting
                                   an amendment proposed to the Constitution by the General Assembly
                                   by adding to the tenth article a section in relation to the debt
                                   charged upon the Wabash and Erie Canal.
                              It was read through by the Clerk.
                              Mr. RICHARDSON moved that it be referred to the select committee on
                                   that subject.
                              Mr. KIMBALL desired that the joint resolution should be put at once
                                   upon its passage. He hesitated to press the motion to table the
                                   motion to refer.
                              Mr. RICHARDSON. So far as he was concerned he did not care from
                                   which party this proposition came. As he understood it, this
                                   proposition is simply a copy of the joint resolution on the same
                                   subject offered yesterday by the gentleman on his left [Mr.
                                   Shirley].
                              Mr. SHIRLEY. The only difference between this and mine is, that I
                                   fixed the time of voting for ratification or rejection at the
                                   next general election, and this proposition leaves the time
                                   indefiniteyet to be fixed by the General Assembly.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN alleged a discrepancy in Mr, Kimball's
                                   proposition--that it is not a joint resolution, but simply a
                                   resolution of the House. (But the reading of the clause showed
                                   that he was mistaken.) He then submitted another objection The
                                   proposition does not provide the time when the proposed amendment
                                   shall be submitted. If it were amended so as to tix the time
                                   definitely or satisfactorily he would not object to its passage.
                                   He proposed to amend the joint resolution by adding in the proper
                                   place these words: "And if no time is designated by this
                                   General Assembly, then it shall be submitted to the people at the
                                   next general election to be held on the second Tuesday in
                                   October, 1874.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. I am willing to accept that.
                              Mr. RICHARDSON withdrew his motion for reference.
                              Further brief remarks were submitted by Messrs. Woollen, Given,
                                   Bowers and others, and further talk across the House resulted in
                                   perfecting the clause for the adoption of the proposed
                                   constitutional amendment and for the submission to the
                                   people.
                              The joint resolution was read as amended. It is as follows:

                                                  and that the said amendment shall be submitted to
                                                  the electors of the State for their ratification
                                                  at an election to be called for that purpose in

                                                  submission ; and if no time is designated by this
                                                  General Assembly, then shall be submitted to the
                                                  people at the next general election to be held on

                              The SPEAKER. The question is: Shall the joint resolution be adopted
                                   and ordered to be entered upon the journal ?
                              The proposition was again read through by the Clerk.
                              Mr. ANDERSON considered that the clause for submission to the
                                   people should read,
                                   "for Ratification or Rejection." Though he
                                   might prefer such a modification he should still vote for the
                                   measure.
                              The vote was then taken on the adoption of the joint rasolution,
                                   and the result was reported--Yeas, 97--Nays, none--as

                              HUNTING AND SHOOTING.
                              Mr. FURNAS introduced a bill [H. R. 8] for an act to prevent
                                   hunting and shooting on enclosed land without the consent of the

                              The bill was read the first time and order to the second
                                   reading.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN submitted a motion for an order to inform the Senate

                                   discharged from further consideration of that subject.
                              The SPEAKER. The information will go the Senate without an
                                   order.
                              Mr CAUTHORN. Then I withdraw that part of it, and submit the motion
                                   for the discharge of the select committee.
                              The motion was agreed to, and the com mittee was accordingly

                              Mr. HARDESTY submitted the following preamble and resolutions:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             WHEREAS, This House has heard
                                                  with deep regret of the death of Hon. John W.
                                                  Burson, a member of the Senate from the counties
                                                  of Delaware and Madison that, in his death the
                                                  State has lost an able and incorruptible patriot;
                                                  therefore,
                                             RESOLVED, That this House as a
                                                  mark of respect to the memory of the deceased, do
                                                  now adjourn.
                                             RESOLVED, That a copy of the
                                                  resolution be transmitted to the family of the
                                                  deceased by the Clerk of the House.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Mr. CAUTHORN said he did not wish to be technical about such a
                                   matter as this, but he would move to strike out the words,
                                   "a member of the Senate from the counties of Delaware
                                   and Madison," and insert other words in lieu of them. He
                                   was willing to join in any form of expression, however strong, to
                                   do honor to the memory of the deceased; but as the Senate at the
                                   last regular session had taken a certain action declaring Mr.
                                   Burson not a member of that body, the naming of him as a Senator
                                   in the resolution might be unfavorably construed, both as against
                                   the fact and an unparliamentary reflection. He would, therefore,
                                   substitute these words: "An honorable citizen of the
                                   State of Indiana." He did not offer this from any
                                   feeling personal or political, but simply on account of the
                                   action which was taken by the Senate at the last session.
                              Mr. KIMBALL moved to lay the amendment on the table.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              And then the resolutions were adopted.
                              The SPEAKER. In compliance with the action just taken, I declare
                                   the House adjourned till to-morrow morning nine
                                   o'clock.
                              The House then adjourned.

                                             RESOLVED, That the Doorkeeper be

                              Mr. TAYLOR moved that the resolution be amended by providing that
                                   the Assistant Secretary shall be furnished with a copy also.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE accepted the amendment.

                                   within the city limits, except rolling stock; also on omnibuses
                                   or other vehicles run for the carriage of passengers; also a tax
                                   of not exceeding $2 on each dog, or $5 on each bitch, and also a
                                   poll-tax not exceeding 50 cents on each male inhabiant over ten
                                   and under fifty years of age.]
                              He moved that the rules be suspended, so that the bill may be read
                                   a second time now. He said the bill is a very important one to
                                   the citizens of Fort Wayne, and they were very anxious it should
                                   be passed without delay.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS suggested that if the yeas and nays were called, as
                                   required by the Constitution, upon this motion, that the Senate
                                   might find itself without a quorum.
                              Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN thereupon withdrew his motion.
                              Mr. CAVE introduced a bill [S. 11] for an act to fix the time of
                                   holding the Circuit Courts in the several counties of the Third
                                   Judicial Circuit, and repealing all laws in conflct therewith and
                                   declaring an emergency. [It affects the counties of Gilson,
                                   Martin, Pike, Dubois, Daviess and Knox.]
                              Mr. BEESON introduced a bill [S. 12] to give the rights of action
                                   for injuries in certain cases and declaring an emergency. [It
                                   provides that where any one is injured in person or property, or
                                   means of suport or otherwise, by any intoxicated person, or by
                                   reason of the intoxication of any person, directly or indirectly,
                                   such an one shall have the right of action, in his or her own
                                   name, against any person or persons who shall by the giving or
                                   selling of any intoxicating liquor, or otherwise have caused or
                                   contributed to the intoxication of such person committing the
                                   injury, and in such action the plaintiff shall have the right to
                                   recover part, prospective and exemplary damages, and the owner or
                                   lessee of premises, having knowledge that intoxicating liquors
                                   are to be sold thereon shall be liable. Damages received by a
                                   wife in such action shall be her sole and seperate property.]
                              Mr. WILLIAMS introduced a bill [S. 13] for an act requiring
                                   railroad companies organized under any law of the State of
                                   Indiana, to keep their principal office within the State, and
                                   have a majority of the directors resident within the State of
                                   Indiana and along the line of their road. [And this, even though
                                   a railroad, may have been leased to an individual or foreign
                                   corporation. Failure to comply with these provisions shall work a
                                   forfeiture of the charter.]
                              Mr. SMITH introduced a bill [S. 14] for an act to amend section
                                   five, of an act entitled
                                   "An Act concerning Mortgages," approved May 4,
                                   1852. [Providing that every mortgager or assignee of lands,
                                   having received payment, shall within thirty days of such payment
                                   enter on the margin of the record satisfaction in full or deliver
                                   to the mortgager a receipt in full, duly acknowledged, upon
                                   penalty of not less than five nor more than one hundred
                                   dollars.]
                              These bills were severally read the first time and passed to the
                                   second reading.
                         
                         
                              SARNIGHAUSEN AND BIRD CONTEST.
                              Mr. WADGE submitted the following:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, That the
                                                  Committee on Claims be
                                                  instructcd to inquire and report what allowance,
                                                  if any, should be made John Sarninghausen for
                                                  expenses incurred in defending the contest of his
                                                  seat in this body at the last regular session.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Mr. BROWN moved lo amend the resolution by directing the committee
                                   to inquire what expenses the Senator [Mr. Bird] who succeeded in
                                   the contest incurred.
                              Mr. WADGE accepted the amendment.
                              The resolution, as amended, was adopted.
                              The PRESIDENT announced as the committee on considering what
                                   allowances should be made to the officers of the last Senate who
                                   assisted in the organization of this Senate, Messrs. Hubbard,
                                   Haworth and Francisco.
                              On motion by Mr. BROWN, the documents accompanying the
                                   Governor's message were ordered printed therewith.

                                   till Tuesday.
                              And then the Senate adjourned till Monday at two o'clock
                                   p. m.

                         HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                         
                              FRIDAY, November 15, 1872.
                         
                         The House met at nine o'clock a. m.
                         The SPEAKER directed the reading of the journal of yesterday.
                         The reading proceeded, until--
                         On the motion of Mr. WOODARD, the further reading was dispensed
                              with.
                         Mr. BAKER asked and obtained leave to record his affirmative vote on Mr.
                              Kimball's constitutional amendment joint resolution, which
                              passed the House unanimously on yesterday.
                         
                              ADJOURNMENT TILL MONDAY.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN. Considering the difficulty about getting along with
                                   the business of the House till the standing committees shall be
                                   appointed; and that there is no special order but that for the
                                   consideration of the Governor's Message, which is fixed
                                   for Monday afternoon at three o'clock. He would move
                                   that when this House adjourn to-day, it shall adjourn till Monday
                                   at two o'clock p. m.
                              The motion prevailed.
                         
                         
                              RULES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                              Mr. OFFUTT, from a majority of the Special Committee on
                                        Rules, recommended the adoption of the rules of
                                   the last House of Representatives, with amendments as to the
                                   numbering, and an additional rule, No. 65, which was read:
                                   "Rule 65. Motions to lay proposed amendments on the
                                   table, if they prevail, shall not affect the general subject--the
                                   original proposition." He reported also a recommendation
                                   for the adoption of the joint rules for the government of the
                                   intercourse between the two houses as they stood at the last
                                   session of the General Assembly, with an amendment as to the
                                   joint rule No. 11, which was not read.
                              The vote was taken on concurrence and the adoption of the reported
                                   amendments.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN alleged a misunderstanding as to the proposed
                                   sixty-fifth rule.
                              Mr. OFFUTT explained. The sixty-fifth rule was not adopted by the
                                   commitee in their session last night, but gentleman from Marion
                                   [Mr. Kimbal] sired it, and obtained the consent of members of the
                                   committee separate have it put into the report.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN. The new rule was this: When an amendment to any
                                   proposition is laid on the table it does not carry the original
                                   proposition also to the table. But for the House to adopt this
                                   would be to abolish, ignore an established rule of parliamentary
                                   law. The carrying of the original proposition to the table in
                                   this way--by tabling a proposed amendment--does not finally
                                   dispose of the original proposition under the generally
                                   recognized parliamentary law, but simply postpones action. The
                                   object of the parliamentary rule which this sixty-fifth rule
                                   would destroy is simply to enforce direct action on the merits of
                                   all amendments. I hope that rule will not be adopted. It is not
                                   necessary to the dispatch of business.
                              
                              Mr. WALKER. It was perfectly competent for this House to amend any
                                   parliamentary rule. This laying of an amendment on the table
                                   should not affect the original proposition, for in this way any
                                   member unfriendly to the pending measure might manage from day to
                                   day to table the most important proposition and postpone action
                                   indefinitely. The adoption of this rule here would not affect
                                   parliamentary law in any just principle. It is adopted in many
                                   legislative bodies.
                              The SPEAKER. The report and amendments have been adopted.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN. Then I will ask to submit my minority report, and
                                   re-open the question.
                              The SPEAKER. If there is no objection the gentleman can submit his
                                   report.
                              There being no objection--
                              Mr. CAUTHORN wrote and sent up his minority report to this effect,
                                   which was read by the Clerk:
                              As a member of the select committee appointed to prepare and report
                                   rules I concur in the report of the majority, except as to the
                                   recommendation of the sixty-fifth rule.
                              The SPEAKER stated the question to be on the adoption of the
                                   minority report, and it was rejected--affirmative 33, negative
                                   39.
                              The rules and reported amendments recommended by the majority of
                                   the committee were then adopted without division.
                         
                         
                              HOUSE OF REFUGE.
                              Mr. FURNAS submitted the following:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             WHEREAS, it is a fact that none
                                                  of the work done on the principal building last
                                                  erected at the Reform Schhol, commonly called the
                                                  House of Refuge, situated at Plainfield, Indiana,
                                                  has not yet been paid forthe Directors and
                                                  Superintendent thereof maintaining that such work
                                                  has not been done according to contract and
                                                  specification in reference to said building;
                                                  and,
                                             WHEREAS, permanent work said to
                                                  be absolutely necessary in the completion of said
                                                  building has been done by the building contractor
                                                  in completion of said building, and which to this
                                                  time has not been paid for; compensation,
                                                  therefor, refused to be made for said work in
                                                  consideration of the same being outside of the
                                                  specifications of the architectural design, as
                                                  well as the inefficiency of the work;
                                                  therefore,
                                             RESOLVED, That a Committee of
                                                  five be appointed by the Speaker of this House to
                                                  investigate the matters of difference as above
                                                  stated, with sufficient powers to send for persons
                                                  and papers. And that said Committee be required to
                                                  report the result of their deliberations at an
                                                  early day.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Mr. FURNAS. Two years ago he had offered here a similar resolution,
                                   and he stated the cause of failure of its object. He now
                                   explained the necesity for this action. The foundation of that
                                   principal building was to be laid a certain depth; but when they
                                   came to look at it the builder thought it was not deep enough,
                                   and ordered them to go one foot deeper. That one foot involved
                                   them in a quicksand; and on account of this it was necessary to
                                   deviate from the plan of the architect; and on this account the
                                   directors refused to pay for the work, and the men that did it
                                   are not yet paid. It is a matter of justice that these men should
                                   be paid. I am acquainted with the facts, and I know that somebody
                                   should be remunerated for the work that has been done.
                              On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, it was referred to the Committee
                                        on Benevolent and Scientific Institutions.
                         
                         
                              FEES AND SALARIES.
                              Mr. WOODARD submitted the following;
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, That there be appointed
                                                  a Committee of one member from each Agricultural
                                                  district to take into consideration the whole
                                                  subject of Fees and Salaries; and that they report
                                                  to this House at an early day,
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Mr. BRANHAM. I hope we will not start out at this early day of the
                                   session to strip the regular committees of the House of their
                                   proper business. I move the reference of the resolution to the
                                        committee on Fees and Salaries.
                              Mr. WOODARD understood from the recommendation of the Governor, as
                                   well as from other sources, that this question of a just fees and
                                   salary law is a very important matter. The existing law is not
                                   satisfactory. It works injuriously upon the people, and all
                                   parties want relief, and, as the Governor says, the country would
                                   be very much better off to have the old law. This matter
                                   appertains to the finances--the taxation of the country. Then let
                                   us have this measurethe most important of the session--referred
                                   to a committee of one from each Congressional District, so that
                                   from all parts of the State we may collect the essential facts to
                                   act upon, and get a good fees and salary law. The regular
                                   committee will have enough to do without it, and the special will
                                   have the double advantage, ample time and complete knowledge what
                                   the people require.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN considered it best that this matter be confided to a
                                   special committee. At least I think it unnecessary to refer it to
                                   any committee unless it is composed of men who know the courts,
                                   and are well acquainted with official duties and
                                   responsibilities. I believe that a fee bill can be prepared that
                                   will be satisfactory, and will not be liable to the objections to
                                   the new law or the old law, and that this resolution might secure
                                   the appointment of a special committee of gentlemen who are familiar with fee bills
                                   and courts, and can assure the needed reform.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY'S people generally were not annoyed by this
                                   question. Both parties in Morgan county (where he resides) accept
                                   the present fee bill. Only the office holders are not satisfied
                                   with it. From this fact he thought this ought not to be made a
                                   party measure here. It ought to be placed in the hands of a
                                   special committee. He would be in favor of a plan as to the
                                   appointment of this committee by which we might go outside of the
                                   General Assembly and call upon competent men to serve on it
                                   without respect to party. In this way he thought we might get out
                                   of this trouble, do justice to the people and justice to the
                                   public officers; and he did not believe that there could be
                                   selected from the members of this House a committee that could so
                                   well accomplish this result.
                              Mr. OFFUT said it might not be in the province of the House to
                                   raise such a committee as that proposed by the gentleman from
                                   Morgan and Johnson, [Mr. Shirley.] Both parties in his county
                                   were in favor of the principle of the law, desiring amendments in
                                   the details. The people, the tax payers, in favor of it--the
                                   office holders against it--but all were living up to it. He would
                                   like to see the resolution referred to such committee as would
                                   take the most interest in it, whether special or regular.
                              Mr. CLARK'S people were having considerable trouble over
                                   this matter, and he thought they were having it pretty much all
                                   over the State. It would require a committee of honest,
                                   intelligent, working men to secure a good law, and he was rather
                                   in favor of a special committee.
                              Mr. BRANHAM could not see why we could not have as good men for the
                                   regular as for the special committee. If we want to destroy the
                                   efficiency of the standing committees take the work of the
                                   session away from them.
                              Mr. LENFESTY regarded Mr. Shirley's proposition as an
                                   imputation on the intelligence of the House. He could not think
                                   that we are so partisan that we can't go for the best
                                   interests of the people. There was to be a regular committee of
                                   the House formed for the special purpose of taking this matter
                                   into consideration, and it occurred to him that our number is
                                   sufficient to assure any gentleman that a good selection could be
                                   made of men unbiassed by party spirit.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY had not intended to cast any reflection upon any member
                                   of the House. He desired to place this matter in the hands of a
                                   commission that could consider it unhampered by other duties. He
                                   understood the Governor as favoring such a course. He only wanted
                                   to insure a good thing--to carry out the idea of the
                                   Governor.
                              Mr. BAKER thought this discussion premature. It belongs to the
                                   things recommended by the Governor, and we go into committee of
                                   the whole, on the Governor's Message, next Monday. He
                                   was in favor of referring all questions of such importance as
                                   this to the regular committees of the House.
                              Mr. WALKER. There might be a contingeney in which he would be in
                                   favor of the suggestion of the gentleman from Morgan and Johnson
                                   [Mr. Shirley.] But this is a question which it did not seem to
                                   him to be proper to take out of the hands of the regular
                                   committee. He was in favor of referring it now to the regular
                                   committee, and after making a trial of it there, if not
                                   satisfactory, it might be taken out of their hands. I have not
                                   seen anything here yet that authorizes the apprehension that the
                                   voice of partizanship will be heard in the Hall.
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE would be satisfied to refer the matter to the
                                   regular committee, but the standing committees are not yet
                                   appointed; and to give the Speaker time for the work of those
                                   appointments, so that we may know what to do with measures that
                                   come before ushe moved that the House adjourn.
                              The motion was rejected.
                              The resolution was then referred to the Committee on Fees
                                        and Salaries.
                         
                         
                              EMPLOYES.
                              Mr. BRANHAM submitted the following:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, That this House
                                                  recommend to the Committee on
                                                  Employes that, when they can do so, they
                                                  employ for pages and other service, such boys of

                              In Thy presence, oh Lord God, help us always to remember our own
                                   littleness. In Thy presence help us to remember our own need of
                                   help. Graciously condescend to give us wisdom instead of
                                   ignorance, light instead of darkness, and help whenever in need.
                                   What we need Thou canst abundantly supply. Give, we pray Thee, to
                                   these Senators here assembled, wisdom. Thou knowest what great
                                   interests are depending upon them. Thou knowest, oh Lord, how
                                   much they need the guidance and wisdom that comes down from on
                                   high. Give to them this wisdom, we pray Thee, peaceful, pure, and
                                   easily to be entreated. And we ask, oh Lord God, that Thy
                                   blessing may rest upon them, not only for this day, but during
                                   the entire session, so that there may be such legislation enacted
                                   as shall be for the good of the great State. Bless Thou this
                                   State. Bless Thou all its officers. Bless Thou its Governor.
                                   Bless Thou this Legislature assembled. Bless Thou, we pray Thee,
                                   all entrusted with the administration of public affairs
                                   throughout this commonwealth, and grant that its affairs may be
                                   so wisely adjusted and conducted that all may redound to the
                                   honor and glory of God. Hear us in our prayers, and give us help
                                   according to our need, we ask Thee in the name of Christ, our
                                   Lord. Amen.

                              WABASH AND ERIE CANAL.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN moved that the joint resolution [H. R. 2.]
                                   agreeing to and adopting a joint resolution passed by the last
                                   General Assembly, proposing an amendment to the Constitution by
                                   adding to the ninth article a section in relation to the debt
                                   charged upon the Wabash and Erie Canal, be taken from the table
                                   and put upon its passage.
                              Mr. DAGGY apprehended that the action proposed now would be
                                   premature. If this resolution be passed no other reform of the
                                   kind can be proposed this session except the calling of a
                                   Convention to amend the Constitution. His impression was that
                                   this resolution had better be passed over for the time being,
                                   until it is decided what is best to do. Whether it is better to
                                   call a Constitutional Convention or propose further amendments to
                                   the Constitution in this way.
                              Mr. BROWN made the point that the passage of this resolution,
                                   notwithstanding it may be in the very words of the resolution
                                   passed at the last session, would not fill the requirements of
                                   the Constitution ; but the resolution itself, passed two years
                                   ago, must be brought from the Secretary of State's
                                   office and put upon its passage here. The identical resolution
                                   must pass both of these Houses, and have entered upon it the
                                   action of respective bodies, for the purpose of authenticating
                                   the fact that the identical resolution passed this General
                                   Assembly; and for the purpose of ascertaining whether he was
                                   right or not, he moved to refer this resolution to the Committee
                                   on Judiciary.
                              Mr. GREGG fully concurred in the opinion expressed by the Senator
                                   from Jackson [Mr. Brown] as to what the Constitution requires,
                                   and so believing he introduced a resolution the other day calling
                                   upon the Secretary of State to furnish the Senate with a
                                   certified copy of the joint resolution passed last session. He
                                   was inclined to think the original copy would be the proper thing
                                   for this General Assembly to pass. This is a matter of too much
                                   importance to work at with too much haste. There was too much
                                   haste in this matter two years ago, and he was sorry to say that
                                   the Secretary's journals are in a bad shape. He favored
                                   the motion to refer.
                              Mr. STEELE preferred the motion to refer, and opposed haste,
                                   inasmuch as this matter is of very great importance; perhaps of
                                   more importance than anything that will be before us this
                                   session.
                              Mr. BROWN said the reason he was careful about this matter is this,
                                   for some strange and singular
                                   reason to him entirely unknown, one of the plainest provisions of
                                   the Constitution of the State was disregarded on the part of the
                                   Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of
                                   Representatives. Neither of these gentlemen seemed to understand
                                   that it was their duty to spread this amendment, with the yeas
                                   and nays thereon, upon the journals of each House. This, for a
                                   time, was thought to be a great misfortune to the State, but on
                                   investigation we find that part of the Constitution was merely
                                   advisory. The Supreme Court has decided that the enrolled copy
                                   lodged with the Secretary of State, having upon it the signatures
                                   of the presiding officers of both Houses, is a higher character
                                   of evidence than the journals of either or both Houses, and that
                                   sound and sensible decision saves this constitutional amendment,
                                   if the State makes no further blunders.
                              Mr. SLEETH asked what evidence the Senate had that this resolution
                                   ever passed the body. The journal of this House doesn't
                                   show it. There is not a word on the journal of this House in
                                   regard to this resolution.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN fully concurred in the opinion that the
                                   resolution should be passed, and not a substitute for it;
                                   therefore, he favored the motion to refer.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS, being informed that the Secretary of State, in answer
                                   to an order adopted the other day, has furnished the Senate with
                                   a certified copy of the resolution, moved that it also be
                                   referred to the committee.
                              The motion to refer was agreed to.

                              By Mr. BEARDSLEY, a bill [S. 43] for an act to authorize the
                                   construction of levees, dykes and drains, and repealing all
                                   former laws in conflict therewith.
                              Mr. GLESSNER offered the following resolution :
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             WHEREAS, It is evident that the
                                                  Doorkeeper in executing the order of the Senate
                                                  directing the Senate chamber to be appropriately
                                                  draped in memory of the late John W. Burson,
                                                  deceased, has, in the great profusion of drapery,
                                                  far exceeded what was contemplated by the Senate,
                                                  therefore,
                                             RESOLVED, That a committee of
                                                  three be appointed to determine the amount of
                                                  drapery that should be used, still leaving
                                                  sufficient to appropriately carry out the spirit
                                                  of the resolution authorizing the same and report
                                                  the result of their deliberations to-morrow.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              On motion of Mr. STEELE, the resolution was laid on the table.
                         
                         
                              ENTRANCE OF VICE-PRESIDENT COLFAX.
                              The committee appointed to invite Vice-President Colfax to a seat
                                   on the floor of the Senate having now arrived with the
                                   Vice-President in custody, Mr. WADGE announced the fact and moved
                                   a recess of ten minutes.
                              The motion prevailed, and PRESIDENT FRIEDLEY said:
                              GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE: I
                                   have the pleasure of presenting to you one of Indiana's
                                   most distinguished citizens, the Hon. Schuyler Colfax,
                                   Vice-President of the United States.
                              Mr. Colfax was received with applause and calls for a speech, to
                                   which he responded.
                              Mr. Colfax commenced by referring to his first association with
                                   public affairs nearly thirty years ago in this very chamber, as
                                   the reporter of the proceedings of the Senate for the
                                   Indianapolis Journal in the year 1843. What a
                                   change there has been, not only in our country, but in our State,
                                   since then! It has been said that the people of every county in
                                   this State can now take their breakfast at home and be at their
                                   State capital the same day. Then, the journeying was long and
                                   tedious, the roads almost impassible in the winter time. When he
                                   first came to the Capital it occupied some five days to travel
                                   from South Bend. He remembered at that time listening to a speech
                                   of the ex-Governor in relation to the future of Indiana, who said
                                   that although there were no railroads then in the State of
                                   Indiana the time would, come within the lives of some of those
                                   who listened to him when the Capital of the State would be like
                                   the hub of a wheel, the railroads diverging from it in every
                                   direction like the spokes diverging from the hub. The prediction
                                   was received with incredulity, but yet to-day it is more than
                                   realized.
                              I need not speak of the history of Indiana. It is one of which all
                                   of us may justly be proud. The achievements of her sons on the
                                   land and on the sea, in war and in peaceof her people in the
                                   development of her grand resourcesall tend to add to the honor
                                   and glory of this State, of whose citizenship all of us are so
                                   proud. After alluding briefly to the possibilities of the future
                                   of Indiana, Mr. Colfax proceeded as follows:
                              The Senators and Representatives of a great State like ours have a
                                   weight of responsibility resting upon them, not only in regard to
                                   the political principles which they represent by the votes of
                                   their constituents but also in their legislation for the men,
                                   women and children, the rising generation who are to govern this
                                   State in years to come. To so act that the Legislature shall
                                   promote always the public welfare, that it shall rise above all
                                   these transient political questions, that it shall endeavor to
                                   make our State nobler among her sisters, truer to the right, is
                                   the duty of its Legislators. And we have rules laid down, which,
                                   if they are followed, we shall not err in regard to the
                                   legislation for which we are responsible. You can find them in
                                   the Old Testament and in the New Testament. They are written by
                                   the finger of inspiration itself. In the very thunders of Sinai,
                                   He, who is the ruler of the world, and who spoke to all corning
                                   legislators, laid down the law that should govern them:
                                   "There shall be but one law," said God to
                                   Moses, "for him that is born among you and for the
                                   stranger." Not only
                                   to the Jews who listened to it, but for all legislators in all
                                   times and countries this is a safe and wise rule. And there is
                                   another touchstone in the remarkable Sermon on the Mount, which
                                   was not only for legislators but for individuals the safest and
                                   the wisest rule, "Whatsoever ye would that others should
                                   do unto you, So ye even so unto them."
                              Tested by these two touchstones you cannot err. Whatever is in
                                   accordance with these principles will be right, and the State
                                   that is thus governed will have reason not only to be proud of
                                   its history but to be thankful to those who, chosen from its
                                   midst, have enacted laws basedupon principles like these. Thus,
                                   inspired by such rules as these, your legislation shall stand on
                                   the statute book of this State to your honor as well as the honor
                                   of the State for which you speak and act and vote, and you may be
                                   sure that what ever party may be in the ascendant, however
                                   parties may change, or majorities may change, if your legislation
                                   is based upon these enduring, immutable principles, the shadow
                                   shall not go backward on the dial of human progress that is to
                                   mark the future glory of the history of our State. [Great
                                   applause.]
                              The Senate then adjourned until to-morrow at ten
                                   o'clock.

                                   for damages sustained in consequence thereof.

                              The SPEAKER called the attention of the House to the bill [H. R. 1]
                                   introduced by Mr. Mellett on the first day of the session, for an
                                   amendment to the Constitution changing the day for the holding of
                                   general elections, which remained undisposed of.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY expressed a doubt as to the power of this body to take

                              Mr. MELLETT was equally in doubt as to the right of the House in
                                   the case, and in view of the probability that an act would soon
                                   be passed calling a constitutional convention he would, with the
                                   consent of the House, withdraw the bill.
                              There being no objection the bill was withdrawn from the

                              VISIT FROM VICE-PRESIDENT COLFAX.
                              During the reading of the above bill Vice President Colfax entered
                                   the hall of the House, and was escorted to the Speak- er's desk by General
                                   Kimball. His appearance was greeted with applause by the members.
                                   When the reading of the bill was concluded, a recess was taken by
                                   the House, and members gathered around Mr. Colfax to exchange
                                   congratulations and take him by the hand.
                              The House being again called to order, the Speaker on behalf of
                                   Vice President Colfax, returned his thanks for the greeting
                                   extended to him. Mr. Colfax then withdrew, in company with a
                                   committe sent from the Senate to escort him to the Senate
                                   Chamber.
                              Mr. WILLARD said he was informed by the Clerk, there was already so
                                   much business introduced he would have difficulty in clearing his
                                   table in time for the morning session to-morrow, and he therefore
                                   moved an adjournment. At the request of several members he
                                   withdrew the motion.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN asked and obtained leave of absence for Mr. Kimball,
                                   for Wednesday and Thursday.
                              Mr. WOODARD offered a resolution directing the Doorkeeper to
                                   provide rooms for the use of the standing Committees, which was
                                   adopted.
                         
                         
                              STATIONERY, ETC.
                              Mr. OGDEN from the Special Committee appointed to fix the amount to
                                   be paid each member for stationery, stamps, and the number of
                                   newspapers to be furnished each member reported a resolution that
                                   each member draw $25 worth of stationery and stamps; that the
                                   Chairman of each Committee be authorized to draw $10 worth of
                                   stationery for his Committee; that the Chief Clerk be authorized
                                   to draw an amount of stationery not exceeding the cost of $50;
                                   the Assistant Clerk to draw stationery not exceeding the cost of
                                   $75; the Doorkeeper to draw the needful stationery not exceeding
                                   the cost of $10. He also reported another resolution, that the
                                   Doorkeeper be authorized to contract with the publishers thereof
                                   to furnish each member and elective officer of the House with
                                   three copies of the Indianapolis Daily Journal,
                                   the Daily Sentinel, the Daily Telegraph, the Weekly Volskblatt,
                                   wrapped and stamped, provided such newspapers can be purchased at
                                   wholesale prices.
                              Mr. Kimball proposed to amend the clause with reference to
                                   stationery and scamps, so as to authorize the Secretary of State
                                   to furnish each member of the House with $50 worth of Stationery
                                   and stamps; and that each member elect the amount of stationery
                                   and stamps for himself.
                              The amendment was adopted.
                              The report, as amended, was then concurred in.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY. I have been informed that it is the duty of the
                                   Librarian to furnish rooms for the committees; and if that be so
                                   I see not the propriety of placing that duty in the hands of the
                                   Doorkeeper. It may be that the resolution just passed will
                                   interfere with existing arrangements.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN. I believe that the Doorkeeper is the proper officer
                                   to furnish the committee rooms; but if anything has been done in
                                   the matter of hiring rooms, the Doorkeeper can confer with the
                                   Librarian.
                              Mr. SCHMUCK moved for a reconsideration of the vote by which the
                                   amended report of the Special Committee on
                                        Stationery was concurred in, stating that himself
                                   and others near him did not understand the question.
                              The SPEAKER. How did the gentleman vote?
                              Mr. SCHMUCK. I did not vote at all.
                              The SPEAKER. Then the gentleman can't make the motion to
                                   reconsider.
                              Mr. FURNAS. I move to reconsider the vote concurring in the report,
                                   and to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. I hope the motion to reconsider will not be laid on
                                   the table. We certainly did not well understand the question
                                   here. I call for a division of the question.
                              The SPEAKER. A division being demanded, the first question will be
                                   on the adoption of the motion to reconsider the vote concurring
                                   in the report as amended.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. I move to lay that motion on the table.
                              The yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and taken on the
                                   question, the result was, yeas, 56; nays, 39--as follows:

                                                  State of Indiana :
                                             
                                             The Society of Friends of Indiana Yearly Meeting
                                                  respectfully represent that the prison system of
                                                  the State is unsatisfactory, and its results are
                                                  evil: 1st. In the promiscuous intermingling of
                                                  young and old convicts--the novice and the expert
                                                  in crime--in the same jails and State prisons :
                                                  2d. In the reformation of the prisoners not being
                                                  sufficiently the object in view; And 3d. In the
                                                  lack of provision for discharged convicts, the
                                                  consequence being that very many discharged
                                                  convicts relapse into crime, and a
                                                  "criminal class " is being fast
                                                  built up amongst us.
                                             We, therefore, respectfully ask that you will pass
                                                  such laws as will, as far as practicable, obviate
                                                  these difficulties. 1st. By the establishment of a
                                                  central (unpaid) board, which shall have the
                                                  oversight and care of all the prisons in the State
                                                  and of discharged convicts; 2d. By the more
                                                  thorough classification of prisoners, and
                                                  separation of the young from the more hardened ;
                                                  and such other measures tending to the improvement
                                                  of the prison system, as in your judgment, may
                                                  seem advisable.
                                             We also respectfully represent that the present
                                                  buildings occupied by the State Prison South are
                                                  wholly unsuitable for the purpose, and that a due
                                                  regard to humanity requires that they shall be
                                                  abandoned as speedily as possible.
                                             Signed by direction and on behalf the meeting

                                   of the act prescribing who may make a will, the effect thereof,
                                   what may be devised, etc. Repealing section forty-one of the act
                                   prescribing who may make wills, etc. The section sought to be
                                   repealed provides that the determination of a contested will case
                                   against the plaintiff shall not debar any other person from

                                   years.

                                   protection of fish.
                         
                         
                         
                              COMPLIMENT TO GOVERNOR BAKER.
                              Mr. HALL offered the following resolutions, which are similar to
                                   those passed by the House yesterday:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, That we heard with
                                                  pleasure the able and exhaustive message delivered
                                                  in the presence of the joint convention of the two
                                                  Houses of this General Assembly, on Thursday last,
                                                  by His Excellency, Conrad Baker, and whilst there
                                                  may not be perfect and entire unanimity upon all
                                                  the recommendations therein contained, yet, as a
                                                  whole, it commends itself to the judgment of this
                                                  House as an able and reliable State paper.
                                             RESOLVED, That the allusions made
                                                  by His Excellency to Norman Eddy, late Secretary
                                                  of State for Indiana, does credit to his past
                                                  reputation as a Christian statesman, and meets
                                                  with a hearty response and approval from the
                                                  Senate ; and so beautifully and feelingly was the
                                                  allusion made, that we are at a loss whether to
                                                  admire more the sentiments expressed or the
                                                  emotional manner in which they found
                                                  expression.
                                             RESOLVED, That having
                                                  experienced, during his administration, the
                                                  disadvantages resulting from the parsimonious
                                                  salary meted out to him, we appreciate more fully
                                                  the unselfish spirit with which he endeavors to
                                                  shield his successors in office, immediate and
                                                  remote, from like impositions.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              It was adopted.
                              The Senate then took a recess until two o'clock p. m.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The Senate met at two o'clock.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS called up the special order, being a concurrent
                                   resolution providing for a joint committee of the two Houses, to
                                   consist of one Senator and two Representatives front each
                                   congressional district, to consider the subject of reorganizing
                                   the judicial system of the State, the question being on a.
                                   substitute therefor providing for but eleven members of the said
                                   committee.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS spoke in favor of the original resolution. He said: It
                                   is hardly worth while to argue the propriety of the
                                   reorganization of the judiciary system. Perhaps the only question
                                   of difference between members is, how shall we best arrive at the
                                   result desired? We find a great many conflicting interests. An
                                   answer to the objection that the committee is too large, is to be
                                   found in the fact that it is easier for thirty-three men to agree
                                   than for one hundred and fifty. And if there be a small committee
                                   of only eleven appointed, the probabilities are that they will
                                   not be sufficiently conversant with the wants of the different
                                   parts of the State to make a report acceptable to members
                                   generally. Therefore, I suggest it would be better to have a
                                   large committee, which would thoroughly digest the subject, and
                                   be far more likely to present a measure that will be acceptable
                                   to members generally, than to trust the subject to a committee
                                   composed of but eleven members. It being very questionable
                                   whether, during the sitting of this session, the necessary time
                                   can be devoted to the subject, and the people of the State
                                   consulted sufficiently, to prepare a bill acceptable to all parts
                                   of the State; therefore, I think it proper to require the
                                   committee to report to the next session of the General Assembly.
                                   For these reasons. I think the resolution I have introduced
                                   should pass.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE. From the fact that there are conflicting opinions
                                   between members of this body on this subject I, move to postpone
                                   the further consideration of the subject till Friday next, at two
                                   o'clock, p. m.
                              The motion was agree to.

                                                  investigation, and that they report their
                                                  proceedings hereon to this House without

                              He also submitted a resolution for amendment of the rules so that

                                   the use of members, which lies over one day.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. A bill [H. R. 70] for an act to enable counties
                                   bordering on lines or rivers forming State boundaries, and cities
                                   therein, to aid in the construction of railroads opposite such
                                   counties on either side: to run to such counties or to the State
                                   line or river forming the State boundary bordering such county;
                                   to form connections with other railroads in such county, and
                                   prescribing the duties of officers of such counties for that
                                   purpose; and to authorize cities to issue bonds for such railroad
                                   aid. Committee on Railroads.
                              Pending the reading of this bill, on the motion of Mr. CAUTHORN,
                                   there was a recess to hear a speech from the Hon. S. Colfax, Vice
                                   President of the United States.
                         
                         
                              GREETING MR. COLFAX.
                              Mr. Colfax was presently invited, and advanced to the dais for the
                                   Speaker's chair, and received with a quiet, general
                                   applause; and when the Speaker had presented him to the House, as
                                   a distinguished citizen of Indiana, Mr. Colfax, addressing the
                                   Speaker and the House, said, that on the occasion of his visit on
                                   the previous day, he had asked the Speaker to return to the House
                                   his thanks for the courtesy extended to him, and had
                                   congratulated himself, when leaving the hall, that for once he
                                   had escaped from a deliberative body, without the necessity of
                                   inflicting a speech upon the members. He had come in to day to
                                   see the members from his county, Messrs. Butterworth and
                                   Henderson, and some other friends, and had no thought of making a
                                   speech. He, would, therefore, be brief. He wished again to return
                                   thanks to the House for the very courteous manner in which they
                                   had unanimously tendered him its privileges during his brief stay
                                   in the city. As a citizen of the State, he was proud of his
                                   Indiana citizenship, and proud of this representative body (so
                                   universally spoken of here in the highest terms of praise), which
                                   has the guarding of its interests in its hands. In visiting the
                                   Hall of Representatives, he was reminded of the incident in his early public career,
                                   when he sat there as a member of the State Constitutional
                                   Convention.
                              Many who met with him then and had both before and since, filled
                                   important positions in the political history of the State have
                                   passed away, but many of them still remain. Among these he
                                   instanced Judge Pettit, of the Supreme Court, at that tima a
                                   conspicuous leader in the then dominant Democratic party; M.
                                   Hendricks, the Governor elect of the State, between whom and
                                   himself the most cordial and friendly relations had existed from
                                   their meeting here in that convention in 1850, till the present
                                   time; Judge Holman, the Representative in Congress from the Third
                                   District; Judge Biddle, Robert Dale Owen, Judge Dunn, Mr. Newman,
                                   General Dunn, and others. The predictions so freely made at the
                                   time that convention was engaged in its deliberations that by
                                   their action the members were digging their political graves had,
                                   happily, so far as they were; concerned, not been realized, as
                                   many of them had been prominently connected with public affairs
                                   since. Many provisions engrafted in our State Constitution by
                                   that convention the State has since out-grown, and many others
                                   were then considered novel. He was glad to be able to say that
                                   many of the reforms then adopted were afterwards copied by older
                                   States. Especially worthy of mention in this connection was the
                                   clause prohibiting special legislation, and requiring all
                                   corporate bodies to be formed under the provisions of general
                                   laws, so that the rights of the poor might be guarded, and
                                   special privileges and favors denied to the rich and powerful.
                                   Though the constitution adopted by that body was at the time an
                                   honor to the State, she has since in many respects outgrown
                                   it.
                              It would be remembered by many of those present that a few years
                                   previously, at the time referred to by him in the Senate
                                   yesterday, when in 1843 he commenced public life as reporter, the
                                   State was almost bankrupt, although now happily free from debt,
                                   growing and prosperous. But even at that darkest hour in her
                                   history, when scarcely able to raise the means necessary to
                                   defray the current expenses of her government, when she was
                                   compelled to issue scrip which was hawked about the State at a
                                   heavy discount, even then the Legislature, relying upon the great
                                   heart of the people, had levied taxes for the establishment of
                                   benevolent institutions, where those whose minds had been
                                   overthrown could be ministered unto, where the blind could be
                                   made to almost see, and the dumb to almost speak. And, although
                                   the State in her poverty was almost a by-word, her people without
                                   distinction of party had indorsed this action of the Legislature,
                                   and no taxes have been more cheerfully paid then and since. He
                                   believed that noble and philanthropic action had brought
                                   God's blessing with, it that to it might be attributed,
                                   in great measure, the subsequent prosperity of the State. For
                                   State or citizen receiving the "blessings of those who
                                   are ready to perish," will surely receive an abundant
                                   rewards. As citizens of Indiana we were more interested in the
                                   development of her great resources, the advancement of her
                                   material prosperity, and her progress in all that is wise and
                                   just, than in mere questions of party triumph, and he had high
                                   hopes that their deliberations would tend to these resuits.
                                   Invoking the blessing of Him who holds in his hands the destinies
                                   of States and nations, upon their deliberations, and again
                                   thanking them for the courtesy shown him, Mr. Colfax closed
                                   amidst the applause of the members
                              The SPEAKER resumed the call of the House by counties for
                         
                         
                              NEW PROPOSITIONS.

                              Mr. WALKER submitted a motion for an order, which was adopted, that

                              THURSDAY, November 21, 1872.
                         
                         The Senate met at two o'clock, p. m., the President, Hon.
                              George W. Friedley, in the chair.
                         On motion by Mr. GREGG, the reading of the Secretary's journal
                              of yesterday's proceedings was dispensed with.
                         
                              RAILROAD TARIFF.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE called up the special order for this hour, being Mr.
                                   Williams' bill [S. 6] for an act to regulate and make
                                   uniform the prices charged by railroad companies for transporting
                                   passengers, goods and other property to and from Stations on
                                   railroads in the State of Indiana, declaring the duty of certain
                                   officers in relation thereto, prescribing penalties for the
                                   violation thereof, and declaring an emergency.
                              The bill being read the second time, by sections, Mr. DITTEMORE
                                   moved to amend by striking out the second section of the bill,
                                   which exempts from the operation thereof any railroad company
                                   which shall not have been in operation ten years or more. It is
                                   in these words :
                              SEC. 2. The provisions of the preceding sections
                                   shall not apply to any railroad company which shall not have been
                                   in operation for ten years or more.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS did not object to the amendment. The section was
                                   inserted when the bill was drafted, four years ago, to relieve
                                   new and feeble roads. But these roads had now nearly all been
                                   absorbed by or consolidated with large and powerful corporations,
                                   and could not suffer by being included in its provisions. The
                                   bill was prepared in the interest of the merchants and shippers
                                   of Indianapolis, to protect them against exorbitant rates on
                                   goods which were shipped but a short distance. This bill passed
                                   the House of Representatives almost unanimously two years ago,
                                   but on coming to the Senate, it failed from some cause or otherhe
                                   knew not what. There seemed to be but little attention paid to it
                                   at that time by anybody but himself.
                              Mr. NEFF was in favor of striking out, for the particular reason
                                   that these new roads have nearly all consolidated with wealthy
                                   roads, so that the benefit of this second section would enure to
                                   these old companies, and not to the new ones. His constituents
                                   living along the line of some of these old roads have experienced
                                   the troubles referred to by the Senator from Knox [Mr. Williams].
                                   He lives in Winchester, and knew that goods have been shipped off
                                   other roads on to the Bellafontaine road, and forced to pay
                                   exorbitant rates. In his locality shippers have suffered from
                                   overcharge in local freights. For instance, the road from Dayton
                                   to Union City is forty-seven miles long, and that from Union City
                                   to Winchester but ten; yet the freight from Winchester was
                                   greater than from Union City to Dayton. The bill was intended to
                                   protect shippers against such exorbitant charges. For other
                                   reasons, which he could name, he believed the section should be
                                   stricken out.
                              Mr. ORR felt disposed to do justice to railroads as well as to the
                                   citizens of the State, for he remembered that new roads are at a
                                   very heavy expense until they get their roads ballasted and
                                   leveled. He thought it might be doing new railroads injustice to
                                   strike out this section. This motion seems to be a strike against
                                   new roads, and he was in favor of protecting the railroads as
                                   well as the citizens of the State. New railroads would suffer
                                   from requirements like those proposed in the bill. He suggested
                                   that the word "ten" be struck from the second
                                   section, and "five" substituted.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE. The trouble about extending any limit for the time
                                   of the extension of the road has been fully and fairly expressed
                                   by the Senator from Knox [Mr. Williams]. The people he has the
                                   honor to represent are affected by the section proposed to be
                                   stricken out, and were cnovinced that there was no occasion for
                                   it. The principle of consolidation of railroads has been going on
                                   in the State at a very rapid rate; indeed, at an alarming rate.
                                   In his section, a road that is only three years old is in the
                                   hands of the wealthiest corporation in the United Statesthe
                                   Pennsylvania Central. We have arrived at a time when it becomes
                                   necessary for legislators representing the laboring man, the
                                   manufacturer and all the other industrial classes of the State,
                                   to take some steps to protect the interests of the people in
                                   regard to this monopoly. The Indianapolis and Vincennes road,
                                   completed within the last four years, has passed into the hands
                                   of the Pennsylvania Central. On that road the people are taxed
                                   for a car from Spencer to Indianpolis, thirty-five dollars; while
                                   from Gosport, a point eight miles this side, where therer are
                                   competing lines, the price per car is only fourteen dollars.
                                   These extravagant prices fall upon all classes; not alone the
                                   shipper, but the seller and producer--and the time has come when
                                   the representatives of the people should take the matter in hand,
                                   and, if possible, check it now. If it is not done soon, this
                                   alarming and growing evil will become so strong in the land that
                                   legislation in the future will be ineffectual. He was ready to
                                   proceed at once to legislation on this subject, and, if possible,
                                   put a check upon the growing evils these corporations impose upon
                                   the country generally.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS objected to the remark made by the Senator from Knox
                                   [Mr. Williams], that no other Senator seemed to take any interest
                                   in this matter two years ago, as doing injustice to other
                                   Senators who were here then.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE moved to amend the amendment so as to strike from the
                                   second section the word "ten," and insert
                                   "five," and add a clause that this provision
                                   shall not apply to roads consolidated with or leased by railroads
                                   which have been in operation more than ten years. It takes five
                                   years ta get a road ballasted and in running order, and he
                                   thought the new roads should be exempt from the operation of this
                                   bill. The main features of the bill he was in favor of, but at
                                   the same time he did not desire to crush out any railroads by the
                                   operation of this act.
                              Mr. NEFF said he had goods shipped from Boston here and back to
                                   Winchester, for forty-two cents a hundred, when if they had been
                                   shipped direct to Winchester, it would have cost $1.25 a
                                   hundred.
                              Mr. HARNEY said other States have tried this thing and have failed
                                   almost entirely. The State of Illinois had perhaps made the most
                                   effectual effort in the direction of making cheap freights equal
                                   allthrough the State. They passed a series of very stringent laws
                                   upon the subject, and had a commissioner appointed to see that
                                   they were enforced. The commissioner in his last report says it
                                   has been, so far, utterly impossible on his part to regulate the
                                   matter, but he thinks that with some additional legislation there
                                   is a probability that it can be made effectual. There are so many
                                   means by which a railroad can evade compliance with the law that
                                   so far they have been enabled to conduct their business in the
                                   old way. For instance, we say they shall not charge higher rates
                                   than they do on the whole line of their road; they make
                                   arrangements with another road, and the question would arise
                                   whether this pro rata of freight should be on the basis of the
                                   rates with the other road or over their own road. Perhaps their
                                   rates with another road would be lower than they could afford to
                                   do local business for. The matter requires a great deal of
                                   investigation. He suggested that the matter be referred to a
                                   committee and perhaps some means might be devised by which
                                   justice could be done to all parties. A new road is entitled to
                                   no more privileges than an old. It is under the same obligations
                                   to those who support it by their patronage. This bill may be
                                   passed, but as far as a remedy is concerned he believed it would
                                   be ineffectual. While there may be some merit in the proposed
                                   amendment by the Senator from Jasper [Mr. Dwiggins] to look at it
                                   from one point of view, in another light it was not so desirable.
                                   A new road, whatever may be its necessities, has no right to
                                   require for its services from
                                   one community double what it requires from another. All should
                                   receive equal justice at its hands. Where legislation undertakes
                                   to regulate railroads strict and impartial justice should be done
                                   to all parties.
                              Mr. GOODING concurred in what the Senator from Montgomery (Mr,
                                   Harney) had said. He thought this bill, perhaps as important as
                                   any we will have to pass upon. There were some features of the
                                   bill that he did not understandsome features he hardly felt
                                   competent to vote upon at this time. There might be some question
                                   as to the constitutionality of the bill. For these reasons he
                                   moved the reference of the bill to the Committee on
                                        Railroads, that Senators may have an opportunity
                                   to read and ponder over it: before voting on it, but he
                                   afterwards withdrew it by request, for the purpose of allowing
                                   amendments to be oflered.
                              Mr. BROWN renewed the motion, it being understood that every
                                   Senator had the right to send his suggestions to the Committee
                                   with the bill.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS resisted the proposition to refer the bill to a
                                   Committee. Can Senators be better satisfied after it comes from a
                                   Committee than after reading it? Certainly every Senator can
                                   judge for himself whether or not he can afford to vote for this
                                   bill. He insisted, at all events, that Senators ought to make it
                                   as perfect as they can, in open session. He could not see the
                                   necessity for a reference. The bill had been prepared by lawyers
                                   of this city, was plain in its provisions, and he thought every
                                   Senator ought to be able to vote on it at once.
                              Mr. BROWN hoped a motion to refer would prevail because he was a
                                   friend to the principle embodied in the bill, and desired the
                                   action of the Senate shall be valid. Hasty legislation is very
                                   expensive legislation sometimes. We have before us somewhere in
                                   the neighborhood of eighty days of legislation, and a portion of
                                   this time could not be better spent than in considering this
                                   question.
                              Mr. THOMPSON thought the provisions of the bill were so plain and
                                   simple that any one could understand them at once. He pronounced
                                   them fair and equal and he did not believe that the Senate would
                                   be satisfied with anything short of this.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE in order to get the bill in proper shape was willing
                                   to see it referred to a Committee.
                              Mr. WADGE thought an inspection of the bill showed that it was not
                                   drawn by a man who had any practical knowledge of railroading. He
                                   went on to analyze the provisions to show that the rates fixed
                                   were absurd, and no railroad could carry freight short distances
                                   at the rates fixed. Under its present wording railroads would be
                                   compelled to carry passengers for less than one cent a mile.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS replied to the objections presented by the Senator
                                   from Lake, (Mr. Wadge ) declaring that they were based on an
                                   erroneous foundation.
                              Mr. WADGE insisted that his basis was correct.
                              Mr. SLEETH asked if the Senator from Knox (Mr. Williams) was
                                   prepared to state the actual cost to railroads of carrying
                                   freight these different distances.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS replied that he was not.
                              Mr. BROWN. If the Senator from Knox [Mr. Williams] is really a
                                   friend of the measure, it occurs to me that his bantling
                                   won't lose anything by being allowed time enough to
                                   grow. This is a railroad bill of great importance, and, as the
                                   Senator from Lake [Mr. Wadge] says, it is evidently prepared by
                                   men not having a knowledge of railroad affairs. I am opposed to
                                   hurry ing such matters through the Senate. Far be it from me to
                                   suppose that there is a committee in this Senate but what will
                                   act speedily and without delay, and as soon as practicable act
                                   upon any measure submitted to that committee for its
                                   consideration.
                              Mr. GOODING. I favor the object of this bill, and think we need
                                   some such legislation; but to press a vote in the Senate at the
                                   present time, I might be compelled to vote against it. I think
                                   the bill is somewhat imperfect, and that it is of sufficient
                                   importance to require careful and deliberate reflection at the
                                   hands of Senators; and considering its importance, I think it may
                                   well be referred to a committee. Other bills of far less
                                   importance we see proper to refer to committees,and why this bill
                                   should be crowded through the Senate, I cannot understand.
                              Mr. NEFF. While I am in favor of the provisions of the bill, and am
                                   in favor of referring it to a committee, yet I believe that the
                                   Senate, before it refers to a Committee, should perfect it as
                                   near as possible. I believe it to be the duty of the Senate to
                                   perfect the biil in this chamber as nearly as may be. I think it
                                   a matter of very great importance to the people of the State that
                                   we should have this legislation, and that the greatest care
                                   should be taken in perfecting this measure. The people are
                                   demanding it of us, and we should not go home to our constituents
                                   without having done something in this direction.
                              Mr. STEELE suggested that there was  no penalty attached to the
                                   violation of the provisions of this bill, and that it would
                                   require amendment in that particular at least.
                              The motion to refer the bill and pending amendments to the
                                        Committee on Railroads was then agreed
                                   to.
                         
                         
                              STATE PRISONS.
                              A message from the House announced the passage of the concurrent
                                   resolutions by that body, directing that no new contracts be made
                                   for convict labor of the State Prisons, and looking to a system
                                   of graded prisons.
                         
                         
                              SOUTHERN INDIANA U. S. COURT.
                              On motion of Mr. WILLIAMS the Senate proceeded to the consideration
                                   of the message from the House of Representatives, transmitting a
                                   concurrent resolution adopted by that body, instructing Senators
                                   and requesting Representatives from Indiana to use their
                                   influence to prevent the passage of any law by Congress creating
                                   a United Suites District Court for the Southern District of
                                   Indiana.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved to concur in the resolution.
                              Mr. GOODING thought the whereases in the resolution had not been
                                   proven yet; and, knowing something of the wants of the people in
                                   the southern part of the State, he would say that the present
                                   system of United States Courts in this State not accommodate the
                                   people as they should be accommodated. In Wisconsin, Kentucky,
                                   and in Illinois, there is a division of the United States Courts,
                                   and why can not Indiana have two courts? The Senate ought to go
                                   slow before instructing our Congressmen in this regard.
                              Mr. GREGG would favor retrenchment and reform, and should vote for
                                   the resolution.
                              Mr. DWIGGlNS believed the people in the northern portion of the
                                   State were content with one Federal Court in the State, and
                                   thought there was no good reason for an increase.
                              Mr. DAGGY saw no necessity for two Federal Courts in this State, as
                                   only three or four months in the year are required to transact
                                   all the business that comes before the United States Court, as at
                                   present constituted.
                              Mr. GOODING insisted that Senators should not take the whereases to
                                   the resolution for granted, and that this resolution, binding the
                                   hands of Indiana's representatives in Congress, should
                                   not be passed by this body.
                              The concurrent resolution was adopted.
                         
                         
                              JOINT RULES.

                              Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN made an ineffectual motion that 2,000 copies be
                                   ordered printed in the German language.
                              The concurrent resolution was adopted without amendment.

                              Mr. WILLIAMS moved to reconsider the vote by which the concurrent
                                   resolution of instruction to the Indiana Congressional delegation
                                   was passed, he indicating a desire to change it from a concurrent
                                   to a joint resolution.
                              The motion was agreed to.

                              THANKS.
                              Mr, WALKER submitted a preamble and resolution of thanks to the
                                   Judges of the Supreme Court for the use of their consultation
                                   room and law library, so kindly and generously tendered by them
                                   to the Committee on the Judiciary; which was
                                   adopted.
                         
                         
                         
                              HUNTING AND SHOOTING.
                              Mr. FURNAS, from the Committee on Agriculture,
                                   returned his bill [H. R. 8] to prevent hunting and shooting on

                                   passage.
                              Mr. BAKER moved that the bill be referred to the Committee
                                        on Rights and Privileges.

                                   The bill has been examined with sufficient care. It provides
                                   simply to prevent shooting or hunting on enclosed grounds without
                                   consent of the owner. And whilst it is for the benefit of the
                                   farmer, even the sporting men themselves are in favor of it,
                                   because if it becomes a law, it will give them a legal right to
                                   hunt. A chief object is to guard against the reckless
                                   carelessness of hunting parties. Accidents are continually
                                   happening on this account of which he gave examples of fires
                                   occasioned in this way, and the consequent loss of property in
                                   his own neighborhood. He wanted to guard against any such danger
                                   of the loss of property. I have a little farm of 160 acres, and
                                   when I lie down at night I wish to be relieved from the
                                   apprehension of loss from the careless use of guns, which
                                   destroyed a hundred panels of fence for my neighbor. I do not
                                   believe that there is a farmer in my county who is not in favor
                                   of this legislation.
                              Mr. BAKER. My objection is that it would make a too stringent law.
                                   I question if such were the law, whether it would be safe for a
                                   man to be seen out with a gun. I think that while the farmer
                                   receives ample protection, the person hunting should also be
                                   protected. I desire the recommitment of the bill, that ample
                                   protection may be extended to both.
                              Mr. WALTER suggested that under such a bill it might be unlawful to
                                   discharge a gun at a mad dog. Whilst he was in favor of the
                                   object, if the bill does no more than its author intends, still
                                   he desired a fuller consideration.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN. I move to amend the motion to recommit, so that the
                                   committee be instructed to amend the bill by requiring that the
                                   complaint shall be made by the owner of the land.
                              Mr. WILLARD. I would like to amend the instructions for amendment
                                   so that the owner shall be required to post up notice that no
                                   hunting or shooting is permitted on his enclosures.
                              Mr. GIFFORD alleged the injury of farmers' stock in his
                                   county, through careless hunting and shooting by the young
                                   sharks, so that nobody can find out who does it. But because
                                   there might be a necessity for amendment, he was in favor of the
                                   recommitment of the bill.
                              Mr. WOODARD, believing that the bill has been carefully prepared,
                                   feared that if you attach these amendments, you will destroy its
                                   efficiency.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, concurred in both the proposed amendments.
                                   If the bill pass in its present shape, a man would be liable for
                                   hunting on the lands of non-residents (voice, " No, sir
                                   "), and he would be liable to prosecution, even if the
                                   owner of the land have no objection to the hunting, and consent
                                   were actually obtained. It would occasion needless
                                   harrassments,
                              Mr. BILLINGSLY. I am interested in this bill as a farmer. I know
                                   something about the effects of careless hunting. But I rather
                                   desire that the bill should be referred back to the same
                                   committee for amendment, so as to prevent shooting dogs on
                                   another's premises.
                              Mr. BUTTS spoke in favor of the bill, and gave examples of the
                                   destruction of life and property by reckless shooting
                                   parties.
                              Mr. LEE also gave examples of annoyances of this class.
                              Mr. RENO. We need a law of this kind for protection. I know it
                                   would be very acceptable to the people.
                              Mr. RICHARDSON. I am opposed to the bill--not that I am forgetful
                                   of the interests of the farmers--for in my county they are not
                                   thus annoyed. I am opposed to it because it is against the
                                   interests of my people. They are infested with foxes, and raising
                                   up dogs to destroy them ; and I can't see how these
                                   farmers can succeed in exterminating their foxes under such a law
                                   as this bill proposes.
                              Mr. BAXTER. I do not see the force of the gentleman's
                                   objection; because, if farmers want the foxes exterminated, they
                                   will be willing to give the premium for others to do it. I am a
                                   farmer, and I would do so, and invite the hunters to avail
                                   themselves of the privilege. A friend of mine lately brought home
                                   some very expensive sheep from Europe, and the other day some of
                                   these shooters came along, and seven of his sheep were
                                   killed.
                              Mr. COLE. The farmers are very much annoyed in this particular, and
                                   the bill would cut off a source of idleness. These hunters are
                                   not benefitted by their sport; it is mere idleness.
                              Mr. TEETER. The laws already give ample and complete remedy against
                                   the careless use of fire-armsif that is the only object of the
                                   bill. I apprehend that if the bill pass in its present loose
                                   form, any proper legal
                                   construction will show that it can have no effect. I think it
                                   should have amendments, for more careful guarding of the
                                   interests involved.
                              Mr. LENFESTY. I am in favor of the passage of the bill; and I take
                                   higher ground. In the first place, the privilege we have
                                   heretofore granted to the hunter to hunt on the premises of the
                                   farmer is only a privilege; and it was tolerable whilst they
                                   stood in forests of woods; but now farms are cleared, and there
                                   is but little woodland, and the game that is found therein is as
                                   much the property of the landowner as the land itself. Its flocks
                                   of quails and the schools of fish in his brooks are as much his
                                   property as his stock. But now your hunter will go within fifty
                                   yards of the owner's residence and take this game. While
                                   there may be objections to the biil, I do not believe that the
                                   committee would amend it so as to make it better; and I believe
                                   the proposed amendments would destroy it. I therefore move to lay
                                   the amendments on the table.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN demanded a division of the question.
                              The first question being on Mr. Willard's amendment to the
                                   amendment, it was laid on the table.
                              The amendment and the original motion to refer were also tabled,
                                   and then the bill was ordered to the engrossment.
                              Mr. FURNAS, from the Committee on Agriculture,
                                   returned Mr. Wood's bill [H. R. 44] to repeal the dog
                                   fox law, recommending its indefinite postponement. It was
                                   concurred in.
                         
                         
                              NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                              The SPEAKER now proceeded to the call by counties and districts,
                                   for original propositions.
                              Mr. HELLER submitted an order (which was adopted) that one copy
                                   each of the Journal and the Sentinel be furnished to each member,
                                   unfolded.

                                   22, 1871.
                              It was referred to the Committee on Rights and

                                   of persons, employed in the coal mines of Indiana. [It requires
                                   maps to be filed with the county Auditor and duplicates to be
                                   kept in offices of coal mining companies showing boundaries of
                                   mines and direction and deflection of veins, together with
                                   amended maps to be filed yearly showing progress of work in

                                                  Religious Society of Friends, held at Richmond,
                                                  from the 25th day of ninth month, to the first of
                                                  tenth month, inclusive, 1872, respectfully
                                                  represents :
                                             That as a Religious Society we consider marriage an
                                                  ordinance of God, and not a mere civil contract,
                                                  nor a mere human compact, devoid of religious
                                                  obligations.
                                             The original law of marriage, which is found in the
                                                  second chapter ot Genesis, describes a union, such
                                                  as could originate from no human authority.
                                             Our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, when asked by
                                                  the Pharisees, "Is it lawful for a man to
                                                  put away his wife for every cause,"
                                                  re-enacted this law and ordinance for all
                                                  subsequent time. "Have you not read that
                                                  he which made them in the beginning, made them
                                                  male and female, and said. For this cause shall a
                                                  man leave father and mother and shall cleave to
                                                  his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh? What,
                                                  therefore, God hath joined together, let not man
                                                  put asunder." Matt. xix. 4, 5, 6.
                                                  "And I say unto you, whosoever shall put
                                                  away his wife except it be for fornication, and
                                                  shall marry another, committeth adultery ; and
                                                  whoso marrieth her which is put away, committeth
                                                  adultery."Matt. xix. 9.
                                             The legislation of all Christian Nations and States
                                                  should be based upon Christian principles. Hence,
                                                  while the civil law may properly solemnize the marriage contract, it cannot
                                                  properly dissolve it, except for
                                                  the cause which the Divine Law Giver has himself
                                                  pointed out.
                                             We are advised that there are seven statutory
                                                  grounds of divorce in the laws of our State:
                                             1rt, Adultery; 2d, Impotency ; 3d, Abandonment for
                                                  one year : 4th, Cruel Treatment of either party by
                                                  the other : 5th, Habitual drunkenness by either
                                                  party, or the failure of the husband to provide
                                                  reasonable support for his family; 6th, The
                                                  conviction of infamous crime subsequent to the
                                                  marriage; and 7th, "Any other causes for
                                                  which the Court shall deem it
                                                  proper that a divorce shall be
                                                  granted."
                                             We respectfully submit, that all these enactments,
                                                  except the first, are contrary to the teachings of
                                                  Christ and his Apostles ; some of them actually
                                                  encourage divorce, by offering it as a premium for
                                                  crime; and the 7th is unknown to " Common
                                                  Law," and grants such unlimited powers to
                                                  the Court, that by expunging the word
                                                  "other" there would seem to be
                                                  no need for the six preceding specified causes for
                                                  divorce.
                                             So much shameful fraud and corruption have
                                                  characterized the administration of our divorce
                                                  laws, and many innocent persons havo been so
                                                  cruelly wronged thereby, that great odium attaches
                                                  to our otherwise fair record and reputation as a
                                                  State.
                                             The inevitable tendency of such enactments is, to
                                                  unsettle the belief of the people in the religious
                                                  obligations of marriage, and to degrade it to a
                                                  mere contract between the parties, and thus, not
                                                  only to destroy its sacredness, but also its
                                                  permanence. For, as divorces increase, marriages
                                                  are lightly contracted, and as lightly spurned;
                                                  licentiousness increases, the public morals arc
                                                  corrupted, and the purity of society and the
                                                  affections and sacredness of home are ruthlessly
                                                  invaded.
                                             We do, therefore, respectfully, but earnestly, petition your honorable body to
                                                  repeal all the Divorce Laws of our State, except
                                                  that which provides for a legal separation of man
                                                  and wife for the crime of adultery.
                                             Signed, by direction, and on behalf of the meeting
                                                  aforesaid.

                                                  COFFIN,
                                                  Clerk of the Men's
                                                  Meeting.

                                                  HARRIS, 
                                                  Clerk of the
                                                  Women's Meeting.
                                             
                                        
                                   
                              
                              It was referred to the Committee on Rights and Privileges
                                        of the Inhabitants of the State.
                         
                         
                         
                              PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
                              were presented and referred to approbate committees, to wit:
                              By Mr. BEESON, a communication from the Doorkeeper in reference to
                                   the selection of rooms for the use of committees of the
                                   Senate--all but one in Circle Hall.
                              By Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Scott, two claims, one from the Sentinel and
                                   the other from the Journal office, for papers furnished and work
                                   done during the general session 1871.
                         
                         
                              REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                              Mr. BIRD returned from the committee his canal repair bill, with a
                                   favorable recommendation thereon. His constituents were very much
                                   interested in the keeping up of the canal running through their
                                   county, as it supplies water to propel machinery, and for use in
                                   case of fires; but if Senators desired time to consider the
                                   provisions of this bill, he was willing should lie over, though
                                   it was desirable to have it advanced on the files as soon as
                                   practicable.
                              Mr. RHODES desired that the bill should be referred to the
                                        Committee on Canals.
                              Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN moved that the bill be referred to the
                                        Committee on Canals, so that Senators may
                                   be satisfied with its provisions.
                              Mr. BIRD objected to the reference, and moved, ineffectually, to
                                   suspend the order of business, that the bill may be read the
                                   second time now.
                         
                         
                              RESOLUTIONS.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE offered a resolution, which was adopted, that the
                                   elective officers of the Senate be allowed the same papers,
                                   wrapped and stamped, as are allowed members of the Senate.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS offered a resolution requesting the Auditor of State
                                   to inform the Senate of the amount of swamp-land fund now on
                                   hand.
                              It was adopted.
                              Mr. HAWORTH offered a resolution to pay the firemen five dollars a
                                   day for work done four days before the opening of this session
                                   and one after, which was adopted by yeas 27, nays 14.
                              Mr. HALL offered a resolution, which was adopted, instructing the
                                   Secretary to ascertain the names of evangelical ministers of this
                                   city who will offer prayers at the opening of the sessions, and
                                   notify in by mail two days before their services are
                                   required.
                              A message was received from the Governor, transmitting a
                                   communication and memorial from the State Bar Association.
                         
                         
                              PROHIBITORY LIQUOR LAW.
                              Mr. ORR offered the following:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, That the
                                                  Committee on Temperonce inquire
                                                  into the expediency of passing a law prohilfiting
                                                  the granting of license to sell intoxicating

                                                  otherwise.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              It was adopted.
                         
                         
                              HOUSE OF REFUGE.
                              Mr. BEESON moved to suspend the order of business that the bill [S.

                              The motion was agreed to, and the bill was read by sections. On
                                   motion by Mr. Beeson, it was referred to the Committee

                                   opportunity to respond before the order is passed over. On motion
                                   of Mr. Brown, it was laid on the table.
                         
                         
                              COMMITTEE NAMES.
                              Mr. HAWORTH called up his resolution declaring that the
                                        Committee on Emigration shall hereafter
                                   be known as the Committee on Emigration and
                                        Statistics.
                         
                         
                              THE JUDICIARY.
                              On motion of Mr. GEEGG, a message from the Governor, transmitting
                                   the action of the bar of the State on the subject of the
                                   reorganization of the Courts of the State, was taken up, and its
                                   consideration postponed until two o'clock.
                         
                         
                              ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATOR.
                              Mr. HOUGH moved to take up the concurrent resolution in regard to
                                   the election of the United States Senator next Tuesday, a
                                   communication having been received from the House requesting the
                                   Senate to amend the resolution so as to provide that the election
                                   shall be held according to law.
                              
                              Mr. BROWN said the resolution had passed both houses, and the
                                   request of the House was entirely superfluous.
                              No action was taken on the motion.
                         
                         
                              NEW PROPOSITIONS.

                              By Mr. DWIGGINS, a bill [S. 56] for an act to amend sections 21 and
                                   27 of the town incorporation act of June 11,1 which 22d section

                              The Senate then adjourned until two o'clock, p. m.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The Senate met pursuant to adjournment, President Friedley in the
                                   chair.
                              Mr. GLESSNER, by leave, introduced a bill [S. 57] for an act to
                                   repeal the act to prevent the breaking of a quorum of the General
                                   Assembly, approved February 7, 1867, which was read the first
                                   time and passed to the secend reading.
                         
                         
                              THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.
                              This being the hour for the consideration of the special order, Mr.
                                   Dwiggins concurrent resolution, for the appointment of a joint
                                   committee of three, one Senator and two Representatives, from
                                   each Congressional district, to consider the subject and report a
                                   bill for a reorganization of the judicial system of the State,
                                   this committee to have authority to sit during the interim
                                   between the special and regular sessions and instructed to report
                                   to the regular session in January next, wras taken up together
                                   with the proposed substitute therefor, offered by Mr. Glessner,
                                   which would reduce the number of the committee to eleven--four
                                   from the Senate and seven from the House.
                              On motion by Mr. DWIGGINS, a lengthy memorial from the Bar
                                   Association of Indiana, setting forth the necessity for
                                   reorganization of the courts in this State was read. The memorial sets out at
                                   length the evils resulting from the present system, and asks that
                                   the number of Supreme Judges be increased to five, and to
                                   authorize the employment by the judges of secretaries. It also
                                   calls attention to the inadequate salaries paid the judges and
                                   prosecuting attorneys, asks for an increase of the same, and
                                   submits a statement of the salaries paid to judges in the
                                   different States. The memorial also makes numerous suggestions in
                                   regard to the method to be pursued in the trial of cases. It was
                                   transmitted to the Senate this morning through the Governor by
                                   the hand of the Executive Messenger, Captain John M. Commons.
                              Mr. GOODING presented a petition from the attorneys of Vanderburg
                                   county, praying for an increase of the salaries of executive and
                                   judicial officers. It is signed by leading lawyers and prominent
                                   citizens of Vanderburg, Posey and Perry counties, asking that
                                   measures be taken to carry the recommendations of the
                                   Governor's message on this subject into effect.
                              The resolution of Mr. BOONE to instruct the Committee on
                                        Organization of Courts to inquire into the
                                   expediency of dividing the State into convenient judicial
                                   districts, providing for a criminal conrt in each county, etc.,
                                   which had been made a part of the special order, was also
                                   read.
                              The question was then on the adoption of Mr. Glessner's
                                   substitute.
                              Mr. GLESSNER explained that the original resolution requires the
                                   committee to bring in a bill for the reorganization of the
                                   judicial system. It is imperative. The committee would consist of
                                   thirty-three members. It would be too large and altogether
                                   unwieldy. The substitute authorizes the appointment of a
                                   committee to consist of but eleven members. It would require but
                                   a few days for the members from each of the several districts to
                                   get an expression from almost every member of the bar, which
                                   could be placed before the committee and aid greatly in framing a
                                   bill that would meet the demands of the State in this regard. In
                                   the county of Shelby the Circuit and Common Pleas Courts are
                                   eighteen months behind their business. Within a short time,
                                   without doubt, a constitutional convention would be called, but,
                                   for the present, the Legislature shouid take the shortest way to
                                   relieve the wants of the people. He favored the adoption of the
                                   substitute, which requires the committee to report at an early
                                   day.
                              Mr. BOONE moved to strike out the substitute and insert his
                                   resolutions in lieu, which refers the matter to the
                                        Committee on Organization of Courts of
                                        Justice. He would be willing to consult members of
                                   the bar throughout the State, but it is conceded on all hands
                                   that a revision of the judicial system is necessary. The people
                                   urgently demand relief and in many counties the delay experienced
                                   in the courts amounts almost to a denial of justice.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS concurred in the expression that members of the bar
                                   were not alone interested in this matter. It affected the people
                                   of the whole State. This subject has been discussed by several
                                   past legislatures; it has been referred to Committees on
                                        Organization of the Courts, but no committee of
                                   the Senate can give the matter sufficient attention unless they
                                   obtain leave of absence for days and weeks at a time. The
                                   recommendations set forth in the memorial from the Bar
                                   Association, read at the Secretary's desk this
                                   afternoon, were well put and should be acted upon at once and
                                   without delay. Let this Legislature do what it can to relieve our
                                   constituency by reforming the judiciary system of the State, and
                                   thus afford general relief. The present judiciary system was a
                                   crying evil in the State, and required immediate action. He hoped
                                   the substitute would not prevail, because the committee provided
                                   for in it would not have time to perform the business marked out
                                   for it.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE favored the amendment of Mr. Boone, because the
                                   matter properly belonged to the Committee on
                                        Organization of Courts, and because if either the
                                   original resolution or the substitute of Mr. Glessner was
                                   adopted, and the committees named therein entered upon their
                                   duties during this session, the Senate would be left without a
                                   quorum. He thought the Committee on Organization of
                                        Courts should have this matter in their own hands,
                                   and he should vote for the resolutions proposed by the Senator
                                   from Boone (Mr. Boone.)
                              Mr. ORR could not favor the original resolution, because the
                                   committee proposed is too large, and because it proposes that the
                                   committee shall sit after the adjournment of this session.
                              Mr. STEELE did not feel like favoring the organization of a
                                   committee so large as proposed in the resolution of the Senator
                                   from Jasper [Mr. Dwiggins], and especially did he oppose the
                                   sitting of the committee when the Legislature should not be
                                   regularly in session. He preferred to see this subject go to the
                                   regular committee appointed to consider it. The reform was needed
                                   at once. He was in favor of sub- mitting the matter to the committee
                                   to which it regularly belonged--that on the Organization
                                        of Courts--and if they failed it would be time
                                   enough to try another committee.
                              Mr. BOONE supposed there would be a law passed this session
                                   providing for the completion by a succeeding session of any
                                   business left unfinished by this.
                              The substitute [Mr. Boone's] was adopted without a
                                   division, in lieu of that proposed by the Senator from Shelby
                                   [Mr. Glessner]. The resolution as offered by the Senator from
                                   Boone [Mr. Boone] was then adopted.
                              On motion by Mr. O'BRIEN, the papers and documents on this
                                   subject were also referred to the Committee on the
                                        Organization of Courts of Justice.

                              The PRESIDENT announced that he had received from the State Auditor
                                   advance sheets of so much of his Report as related to the subject
                                   of State printing, in accordance with a resolution of the Senate;
                                   which were directed to be placed on the desks of members.
                         
                         
                              NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                              Bills for acts were introduced, read the first time and severally
                                   passed to the second reading, as follows, except in the case
                                   named:
                              By Mr. DWIGGINS, a bill [S. 58] for an act to repeal an act of June
                                   18, 1852. to enforce the 13th article of the Constitution of
                                   Indiana. [The last section declares that whereas the above act is
                                   a disgrace to the State, an emergency exists for the immediate
                                   taking effect of this act.]
                              By Mr. HAWORTH, a bill [S. 59] for an act to amend section 16 of
                                   the county and township railroad aid act of May 12, 1869. [The
                                   amendment provides that no such subscriptions or donations shall
                                   be made or be valid until the railroad shall have been
                                   permanently located, the track laid and one train shall have
                                   passed over it.]
                              By Mr. ORR, a bill [8. 60] for an act regulating interest on all
                                   judgments or decrees, and repealing all conflicting acts.

                                   cent.]
                              By Mr. THOMPSON, a bill [S. 61] for an act to protect society
                                   against dangerous consequences resulting from the pardoning of
                                   persons convicted of felony, on the plea of insanity; to protect
                                   society against the danger ensuing from setting at liberty
                                   persons who may have been acquitted of murder, manslaughter,
                                   robbery, arson, rape, burglary, or larceny, upon the ground of
                                   insanity. [The bill provides that, whenever any person shall be
                                   prosecuted for any murder, manslaughter, robbery, arson, rape,

                                   shall be set up in defense, it shall be the duty of the court or
                                   jury trying the defendant to find specifically whether such
                                   defendant was or was not insane when the alleged offense was
                                   committed, and whether such insanity was impulsive, homicidal or
                                   moral, or not, and in case the court or jury shall find the
                                   defendant to have been insane when the offerise was committed, he

                                   any of the cases heretofore mentioned, shall be committed to some
                                   secure and strong ward of the hospital for the insane for the

                                   kept wholly separate and apart from all other patients in such
                                   hospital. It is expressly provided, further, that when any such

                                   repeal the act providing for the redemption of real property,

                              The report was concurred in.
                              Mr. GIVEN, from the Committee on Education,
                                   returned Mr. King's bill [H. R. 37] to appropriate

                                   ordered to the engrossment.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN asked and obtained unanimous consent for his motion
                                   (which prevailed) to take up Mr. Furnas' bill [H. R. 8]

                                   [H. R. 69] in relation to the settlement of Supervisors with

                                   R. 95] authorizing cities and towns to make and authorize their

                              Mr. WILLARD returned Mr. King's bill [H. R. 99] to
                                   authorize cities and towns of 30,000 inhabitants and over to make
                                   loans and issue bonds, with the committee amendment, inserting

                                   ordered to the engrossment.
                              Mr. FURNAS returned his hunting and shooting bill [H. R. 8], with
                                   the Cauthorn amendment: "Provided that no prosecution
                                   shall be commenced under the provisions of this act, unless the

                                   land," etc. The amendment was adopted and the bill
                                   ordered to the engrossment.
                         
                         
                              PER DIEM OF MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL
                                   ASSEMBLY.
                              On motion of Mr. CAUTHORN the order of business was suspended and
                                   Mr. Wilson of Ripley's eight dollars per diem amendment
                                   bill [H. R. 73] was withdrawn from the committee and taken up for
                                   consideration, the question being on the engrossment.
                              Mr. HELLER said because the bill conflicts with the 29th section of
                                   the third article of the constitution, by providing for an
                                   increase of the per diem of members of the General Assembly, and
                                   that it shall be in force from and after its passage, he would
                                   move that it be laid on the table. But he withheld the motion for
                                   debate.
                              Mr. COBB said if the bill were to pass as it reads, with the
                                   emergency clause, it i would give the increased per diem from the
                                   commencement of the regular session. If passed without that
                                   clause, it would not take effect till the publicationsome time
                                   next Juneso as to affect the pay of the members of the next
                                   General Assembly.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN did not think the constitutional objection well taken.
                                   The Constitution does not prohibit the General Assembly from
                                   increasing their compensa-i tion, any further than that they
                                   shall not increase it during the session at which the bill is
                                   passed. It does not prevent us from increasing our compensation
                                   during our term of office.
                              Mr. BUTTERWORTH. If our fathers served here for S3 a day, and if
                                   they lived here in war times for $5 a day, it seemed to him that
                                   at this time of money stringency we need not increase the amount.
                                   He was for retrenchment and economy.
                              Mr. THAYER considered that the State of Indiana is as able to pay
                                   her Representatives as fair a compensation as any individual
                                   would pay his lawyer. There were bills before the House to
                                   increase the pay of nearly every important officer of the State.
                                   The Governor has been allowed but a pittance, and the Judges of
                                   the Supreme Court have given,, their time to the people on a
                                   salary that would not well support a small family. He hoped
                                   members would not be affected with the mistaken idea of
                                   retrenchment in this matter, but consider the question maturely,
                                   and make the pay consistent with the labor, responsibility and
                                   dignity of the office.
                              Mr. WILLARD proposed to amend so as to avoid, the constitutional
                                   question: Strike out the words "from and after its
                                   passage," in the second section, and insert  these in lieu: "from and
                                   after the first day of January, 1873."
                              Mr. WALKER. There are but two ways in which the time can be
                                   designated when an act of legislation shall take effect; the one
                                   by an emergency clause, and the other by the act of publication.
                                   On his motion the proposed amendment was laid on the table.
                              Mr. MILLER thought the State would be saving money by increasing
                                   the per diem to $8, and cutting off perquisites.
                              Messrs. Cole and Clark favored the bill.
                              Mr. LENFESTY thought it unfortunate that the bill had been sprung
                                   at this time, and regretted the favor it seemed to meet from
                                   Republican members. There were plenty of men who are willing to
                                   serve at the present compensation. The people would not look at
                                   this matter as members might. If members were required to furnish
                                   their own stationery and papers, they would write but few
                                   letters, and send but few papers to their constituents. He did
                                   not want this body to acquire a name for extravagance. This
                                   General Assembly would be expected to make liberal appropriations
                                   to our benevolent institutions, and he would favor such
                                   legislation, but would oppose this extravagance.
                              Mr. HOYER thought the people were ready to increase the pay of
                                   members. He was not afraid of any record he might make on this
                                   subject. Men could not be expected to come here and starve.
                              Mr WALKER was willing to go upon the record in favor of this bill.
                                   He believed his services to his constituents worth eight dollars
                                   a day, if he did not steal anything. He favored increased pay to
                                   all officers of the State. He would follow his own convictions in
                                   the matter, without the dread of the public behind him. He did
                                   not like the idea of raising the question of party in this
                                   connection. He maintained the constitutionality of the bill, and
                                   believed the raising of the per diem and abolition of perquisites
                                   would meet the approbation of the people. It was time to wipe out
                                   the idea that it was a joke to come here and make laws for the
                                   State of Indiana, and this could in some measure, be accomplished
                                   by making the office decently remunerative.
                              Mr. BARRETT moved to amend the bill by striking out "eight
                                   dollars," and inserting "seven
                                   dollars."
                              Mr. HOYER moved to table the amendment.
                              The latter motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. GIVEN opposed the bill. He did not think the fact that members
                                   voted themselves perquisites would justify them in voting for
                                   increased per diem instead. The raising of the per diem, so as to
                                   make the office a lucrative one, would, instead of securing a
                                   higher order of talent, make the office sought after by ordinary
                                   men. He did not think there was any demand for the bill. Men were
                                   not compelled to accept the office, but having done so should
                                   abide by the laws fixing the compensation.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY, while in favor of increasing the salaries of the
                                   officers of the State, regarded the matter of voting to increase
                                   his own salary as a delicate one. He did not like the plan of
                                   voting perquisites, and would prefer a direct salary. The people
                                   know members can not use all the stationery they draw. If
                                   satisfied that a per diem of eight dollars would be a saving to
                                   the people, he would favor it.
                              Mr. WOODARD thought the Assembly should legislate for the masses
                                   instead of the professional classes. At five dollars per day the
                                   members were realizing more than the great majority of their
                                   constituents. An increase would not secure better talent. The
                                   people were not willing to be taxed to raise salaries
                                   indiscriminately.
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE said the cost of session to the State at the
                                   present per diem would be $30,500; the allowance for stationery,
                                   as at present ordered, would amount to $5,000, and the papers
                                   furnished to members to $3,100 more, making an aggregate of
                                   $38,600. At a per diem of $8, the cost to the State of a session
                                   would be $48,800--an increase of $10,21 a handsome sum to be left
                                   in the treasury at the close of the session, or to be devoted to
                                   the benefit of our benevolent institutions. The message of the
                                   Governor shows the necessity of economy in public expenditures.
                                   By increasing the per diem to $8 we take $10,000 from the
                                   treasury, which might be better applied.
                              Mr. BRANHAM said the next House could vote to supply its members
                                   with stationery despite this law. The special session was not
                                   called for the purpose of raising salaries of members, and it
                                   would not look well to commence that work now. He was willing to
                                   raise the salaries of the Governor and judges, because they give
                                   all their time to the public service. If gentlemen consider the
                                   place of a Representative as a question of money, they have to
                                   combine a little patriotism with it, or they can't
                                   afford to go to the Legislature. It is true, that for a man to
                                   come here at the present pay, it injures his business, and if you
                                   can't make it to the interest of competent men to come
                                   here, you must get along without them in many instances. And, if we
                                   can't get enough talent into the General Assembly,
                                   perhaps (and he thought it certain), that it would be the better
                                   way to reduce the number, and give all the pay to a few men. But
                                   he hoped the House would not go into this matter till we first
                                   raise the pay of the judges and Governor, and if we do not raise
                                   the next Governor's salary at this session,we
                                   can't do it at the next; and he would he very glad also
                                   to see the judges' pay increased at this session.
                              Mr. RENO, as a representative of an agricultural community who
                                   worked from four o'clock in the morning till sunset, was
                                   opposed to the bill.
                              Mr. BUTTS wished to call attention to the plank of the Republican
                                   State platform in favor of retrenchment and reform. In view of
                                   that plank he protested against the bill.
                              Mr. MELLETT thought the House was making a record in the direction
                                   of increased expenses. In view of the imporant work pending he
                                   thought these delicate questions should be postponed. He was not
                                   willing to vote increased pay to members while they sat in that
                                   pile of ruins--the old State House.
                              Mr. SMITH said he hoped to be able to vote for a bill to cut down
                                   the fat salaries some of the officers in his county, and could
                                   not do so if he voted for this bill.
                              Mr. THAYER said the question involved was not so much an increase
                                   of pay as a difference in mode of payment. Two-thirds of the
                                   members at the close of the session would vote to retain the
                                   copies of statute, borrowed for the session, and when they got
                                   home would try to sellthem. They were saving their stationery for
                                   the same purpose. He felt that he was getting more than he was
                                   worth, but wanted the per diem increased for the benefit of
                                   future Assemblies. Many men who would like to become members of
                                   the General Assembly could not afford to do so; and thus it was,
                                   perhaps, true that many of the better qualified were kept out on
                                   that account. He was anxious that the men of every General
                                   Assembly should be equal to the service required. Withregard to
                                   the opinion that better pay would not command a better class of
                                   talent, he compared the members of the General Assembly of this
                                   State, or any other State, at five dollars a day, with members of
                                   Congress at Washington at twenty dollars a day, and concluded
                                   that the larger per diem commands the best talent. Now if men are
                                   willing to make sacrifices by coming here to serve the State,
                                   still it is not right; and from such considerations he hoped the
                                   pay of members of the next and succeeding Legislatures would be
                                   increased and thought it would be well to pass such a bill at
                                   once and get it out of the way.
                              Mr. WILLARD demanded the previous question, which was seconded and
                                   ordered by the House, and then the bill was ordered to the
                                   engrossment for the third reading.
                              A message was received from the Governor announcing the signing of
                                   Mr. King's Insurance Company bill. No. 83.
                              Also a communication in answer to the resolution of the House
                                   asking for information concerning the status of the suit of the
                                   State on relation of J. C. Robinson vs. the Terre Haute and
                                   Indianapolis Railroad for the recovery of a sum of money said to
                                   exceed $1,000,000, and alleged to be due the State in trust for
                                   the school fund.
                              Also, a communication transmitting a memorial from the Bar
                                   Association of Indiana.
                              A message was received from the Senate announcing the adoption of
                                   certain joint rules.
                         
                         
                              SIXTEENTH COMMON PLEAS DISTRICT.
                              Mr. GLAZEBROOK returned Mr.Wood's Common Pleas Court bill,
                                   [H. R. 37] prescribing the time for holding the Courts in the
                                   Sixteenth District, recommending its passage.
                              On motion of Mr, WOOD, the rules and constitutional restrictions
                                   were dispensed with, and the bill was passed the third
                                   reading--yeas 95, nays 0.
                         
                         
                              CARROLL COUNTY TRUST FUND.
                              Mr. BARKER, from the Special Committee under Mr.
                                   Richardson's resolution for investigation of certain
                                   matters in Carroll county, called the Carroll county trust fund
                                   case, relating to a discrepancy as to money which should have
                                   been paid into the treasury from the estateof Samuel Griel,
                                   deceased, late of Carroll county, and never properly accounted
                                   for, as appears from the records; reported an order for process
                                   from the Speaker for the attendance of witnesses to testify
                                   before the Committee.
                              Mr. WALKER objected to this as an unnecessary expense. The
                                   testimony could as well be taken in Carroll county.
                              Mr. BARKER said the case involved not only a considerable sum of
                                   money, but a question of character, and the testimony sought was
                                   not of a character that could be compelled before a notary or
                                   other officer.
                              The report was concurred in.

                              Mr. BARRETT offered a resolution instructing the Committee
                                        on Education to investigate and report what amount
                                   of money will be necessary to complete Purdue University; which
                                   was adopted.
                         
                         
                              JAS. F. DILL.
                              Mr. BARRETT submitted a resolution, (accompanied by a statement
                                   from the applicant) for the employment as page or in some other
                                   capacity, of James F. Dill, (a son of Captain J. C. Dill of the
                                   Indiana volvnteers, who was murdered by guerrillas during the
                                   war, leaving his family destitute.) Mr. Barrett said he would not
                                   have presented the resolution but for the fact that the applicant
                                   had served acceptably as a page four years ago; and the
                                   additional fact that in the appointment of pages two had been
                                   selected from one family and he believed in distributing these
                                   things around.
                              Mr. KING moved to refer the resolution to the Committee on
                                        Employes.
                              Mr . WALKER moved ineffectually to lay the motion on the table. The
                                   resolution was then referred to the Special Committee on
                                        Employes.
                         
                         
                              REPEAL OF THE CORPORATION DRAINAGE ACT.
                              The House proceeded to the consideration of bills on the
                                   Speaker's table, and Mr. Butterworth's bill [H.
                                   R, 3] to repeal the corporation drainage act, and the act of
                                   1871, supplemental thereto, was taken up, the question being on
                                   the engrossment.
                              Mr. RUMSEY moved to recommit the bill to the Committee on
                                        Drainage and Dykes, with instructions to amend by
                                   a provision that this act shall not affect drainage associations
                                   organized under the repealed acts, the length of whose line of
                                   ditch is twenty miles and under.
                              Mr. BUTTERWORTH hoped the bill would not be again referred. He
                                   desired a square vote upon it. If there is any question of the
                                   highest interest to the people of the northern part of the State,
                                   it was the question of the repeal of this Kankakee drainage act.
                                   That act was passed by the Legislature of 1869, without the
                                   knowledge of the people, and unasked for by the people directly
                                   or indirectly interested in the work proposed to be done. We have
                                   seen that corporation of land speculators, on the authority of
                                   the State of Indiana, running over territory hundreds of miles in
                                   length and several miles in width, and following up tributary
                                   streams with their assessments of imaginary and intangible
                                   benefits, to the amount of $5,000,000. When these assessments are
                                   filed with the proper officer, they become mortgages upon these
                                   lands for many times more than they are worth--and mortgaged,
                                   too, for a scheme that is almost universally believed by those
                                   who are well acquainted with these lands, to be impracticable,
                                   and worthless when done. It is for this reason that he opposed a
                                   recommittal. He wanted a square vote. Those who know the Kankakee
                                   country best believe this scheme to drain it useless and
                                   worthless. The people know when they want their lands drained,
                                   and they don't want any foreign organization to step in
                                   on a gigantic land grab scheme and do it for them without their
                                   consent. The scheme was an outrage. This bill constituted his
                                   principal stock in trade here, and he could not go back to his
                                   constituents without presenting them this bill enacted into a
                                   law. The law now in force was involving thousands of men in
                                   tedious and exhausting litigation. Thousands of acres are
                                   mortgaged under it. for more than they are worth. He believed in
                                   drainage, but the owners of the lands should be permitted to do
                                   themselves.
                              Mr. BARRETT moved to lay the motion to recommit on the table.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY regretted the disposition to act hastily in the matter.
                                   He had no doubt the law was oppressive in some respects, yet by
                                   its unconditional repeal many would be affected injuriously. It
                                   should receive careful consideration.
                              Mr. HATCH moved the previous question, but the House refused to
                                   second the demand.
                              Mr. BARRETT said the law had been engineered through the General
                                   Assembly in the interest of large non-resident landowners, and,
                                   if unrepealed, would work the ruin of a number of small farmers
                                   in the Kankakee valley.
                              Mr. HELLER said that under the present law the people could not
                                   drain their own land. It should be repealed. A law was now in the
                                   hands of the Judiciary Committee touching the
                                   subject of drainage, and would be reported in such shape as to
                                   guard the rights of all concerned.
                              Mr. WALKER said that the people of his county were not directly
                                   interested in this matter, but they regarded the Kankakee
                                   Drainage Law as a gigantic abuse.
                              Mr. OFFUTT was afraid of hasty action. He wanted the bill referred
                                   back, with instructions to amend, so as to secure rights which
                                   have accrued under it.
                              Mr. LENFESTY maintained that great benefit had accrued from the
                                   work already done. A great
                                   deal of work is now in progress, and the unconditional repeal of
                                   the law would injuriously affect many who were interested.
                              Mr. BUTTERWORTH explained that most of the ditching undertaken by
                                   small companies was under the drainage law of 1867, what is
                                   called "the one man drainage law"--these
                                   organizations to which gentlemen refer, are under the drainage
                                   act of 1867, and not under that which this bill proposes to
                                   repeal.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN suggested that in order to secure rights which may
                                   have accrued, the friends of the bill would do well to consent to
                                   its recommittal in order that a saving clause might be
                                   inserted.
                              Mr. HENDERSON was willing to accept an amendment providing for the
                                   exemption from the operation of the bill of drains not more than
                                   twenty miles in length.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN moved to refer the bill to the Judiciary
                                        Committee, with instructions to incorporate a
                                   section reserving vested rights.
                              The motion was agreed to, and the House then took a recess till two
                                   o'clook, p. m.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The SPEAKER, resumed the chair at two o'clock p.m.
                              Mr. HENDERSON moved to reconsider the vote of this morning,
                                   ordering the engrossment of Mr. Walker's county seat and
                                   building amendment bill [H. R. 81] presenting a remonstrance
                                   against it, signed by Gordon, Floyd, Julian and others, alleging
                                   that its provisions, looking to the removal of the county seat of
                                   Wayne county from Centerville to Richmond, would injuriously
                                   affect the public interests.
                              Mr. WALKER stated that the memorialists were not citizens of Wayne
                                   county; and, on his motion, the motion to reconsider was laid on
                                   the table.
                         
                         
                              JUSTICES COURT APPEALS.
                              Mr. Given's bill [R. R. 7 ] providing that Justices of the
                                   Peace shall have exclusive jurisdiction throughout the county. in
                                   certain cases of misdemeanor, punishable by fine not exceeding
                                   $25, was taken up and passed the final reading in the House.
                                   Yeas, 97; nays, 13.
                              Mr. Given's bill [ H. R. 15] to amend section 70 of the
                                   Justices act of June 9, 1852, by providing that costs shall
                                   follow the judgment in all cases of appeal including accrued
                                   costs, was taken up--the question being on the third reading.
                              Mr. BUSKIRK showed that the bill, by repealing the provision of law
                                   which requires that, in cases of appeals from the judgment of a
                                   Justice, the judgment must be changed to the amount of $5, or the
                                   costs can not be reversed and charged upon the appellee. The
                                   present law in its practical operations, was far better than the
                                   pending bill.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY suggested that the bill does not save the pending cases
                                   of appeal; and if it was likely to pass it ought to be referred
                                   back to the Committee, with instructions to amend it, so that it
                                   would not work injustice in such cases.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, moved to recommit the bill with the
                                   instructions suggested by Mr. Shirley.
                              Mr. MILLER sent up and caused the existing statute regulating the
                                   costs in appeals from the Justices' Court to be read. He
                                   said the Justices' Courts were designed for the
                                   convenience of neighborhood litigations, without a lawyer, in
                                   courts of limited jurisdiction; and this five dollars to change
                                   the costs was put there to discourage litigation about small
                                   matters. There may be exceptional cases, but it has the effect in
                                   ninety-nine cases out of a hundred of keeping little cases out of
                                   the Courts of Record. If this amendment bill pass it will require
                                   the party appealing his case to pay the costs of both trials, He
                                   was opposed to lightly setting aside laws so well known and
                                   satisfactory in practice as this.
                              Mr. WALKER. This bill was drawn to discourage litigation, and it is
                                   no innovation at all. In his practice this was the result:
                                   Whenever a suit is instituted before a justice of the peace the
                                   defendant, if he wants time, simply withholds his defense--his
                                   testimony before the justice, and invites the plaintiff to go on
                                   with his case and make all the costs he may--simply filing his
                                   answer. And when he goes up with his appeal he has only to change
                                   the judgment five dollars and the appellee must pay the costs.
                                   But will this man go into the Appellate Court when he knows that
                                   he will have the costs to pay in any event? This bill will have
                                   the effect to compel parties to close their suits before the
                                   justice. He added, for the benefit of Mr. Shirley, that the bill
                                   saves all pending cases.
                              Mr. GIVEN defended his bill by succinctly stating the operation of
                                   the present law under which the costs follow tne appeal, and he
                                   insisted that his bill is a proposition to discourage litigation.
                                   It proposes security to the defendant. All he would have to do
                                   under it, would be to come in
                                   and confess judgment. Then if the plaintiff would recover more
                                   than the defendant confesses judgment for, he pays the costs and
                                   has his appeal. The object is to prevent these small cases from
                                   being transferred to our courts of Common Pleas. But so long as
                                   it is understood that the costs follow the appeal, there is an
                                   inducement to appeal.
                              The debate was interrupted by the reception of a message from the
                                   Governor, transmitting the names of convicts who have received
                                   the benefits of the pardoning power since 1871, as asked for by
                                   resolution of the House.
                              The question being upon the final passage of the bill, the vote
                                   resulted--yeas 17, nays 72, so the bill was lost.
                         
                         
                              INTEREST ON JUDGMENTS.
                              Mr. WILSON of Ripley, a bill [H. R. 27] concerning interest on
                                   judgment [judgments shall bear the same rate of interest
                                   specified in the contractnot exceeding ten per cent.], was taken
                                   up and passed the third and last reading in the House--yeas 71,
                                   nays 19.
                              The SPEAKER laid before the House the Governor's
                                   communication transmitting the memorial of the Bar Association of
                                   Indiana, with reference to improvement in the judicial system of
                                   the State, which reads as follows:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             
                                                  To the General Assembly of the
                                                  State of Indiana:
                                             
                                             The undersigned appear before you by direction and
                                                  on behalf of the Bar Association of the State of
                                                  Indiana--an organization of the members of the bar
                                                  of Indiana, having for its object the furtherance
                                                  of such measures of judicial and legal reform as
                                                  the public interest may require.
                                             The members of said association have discussed the
                                                  various features of this subject at their
                                                  meetings, and are unanimous in the opinion that
                                                  the judicial system of our State is, in many
                                                  respects, insufficient to meet the wants of the
                                                  people.
                                             Not very perfect at first, it has been far outgrown
                                                  by the rapid advance of the State in population,
                                                  wealth and business. But as some of the reforms
                                                  which seem most desirable can be effected only by
                                                  constitutional amendment, and as it appears likely
                                                  that the constitution will be subjected to the
                                                  revision of a Convention at some day not very far
                                                  distant, by which means changes of this sort can
                                                  be introduced more readily than by legislative
                                                  action, the association have directed their
                                                  committee to confine themselves in this memorial
                                                  to such subjects as are of the most pressing
                                                  importance, and can be reached by mere act of the
                                                  General Assembly.
                                             In the discharge of the duty thus confided to us, we
                                                  wish to be regarded as petitioners simply. We have
                                                  no wish to give advice, much less to dictate to
                                                  the members of this Assembly.
                                             We have implicit confidence in their wisdom,
                                                  patriotism and public spirit, but the members of
                                                  our association represent in a certain sense, the
                                                  lawyers of the State, and although they can endure
                                                  the evils of a defective judicial system, with no
                                                  more and probably with less loss than their
                                                  clients, yet they are in a situation to have their
                                                  minds called to this subject with peculiar force
                                                  and frequency, and they feel that it is not
                                                  improper that they should seek in this manner to
                                                  secure your especial attention to it, among the
                                                  multitude of things demanding your notice.
                                             With this view, we ask your consideration, first, to
                                                  the situation of the Supreme Court, and the
                                                  imperative necessity for increased facilities for
                                                  the transaction of its business.
                                             It is provided by the constitution that
                                                  "justice shall be administered freely and
                                                  without purchase, completely and without denial,
                                                  speedily and without delay." The present
                                                  number of judges of the Supreme Court is four. It
                                                  has not been increased since the organization of
                                                  the State, except in the addition of one judge in
                                                  1852.
                                             The present judges are men of the most laborious
                                                  habits, and work constantly to the full measure of
                                                  human strength, but cannot dispose of the business
                                                  as fast as it accumulates. There are now pending
                                                  upon the docket of that court, about seven hundred
                                                  cases--a number fully sufficient to occupy the
                                                  time of the court for two years to come. This
                                                  condition of things is not new, but has existed
                                                  for several years, notwithstanding the most
                                                  strenuous exertions on the part of the judges.
                                                  Under existing circumstances a debtor who wishes
                                                  to obtain delay, has only to appeal his case to
                                                  the Supreme Court to get from one to two
                                                  years' time at six per cent, interest,
                                                  and this operates as a double injuryfor not only
                                                  is justice obstructed by an appeal for time merely
                                                  in the case appealed, but the opportunity to
                                                  obtain delay in that way induces appeals that
                                                  ought not to be taken, and crowds the docket with
                                                  causes that take the time of the court, to the
                                                  great detriment of those that are really deserving
                                                  of attention. The opportunity also to obtain delay
                                                  by taking an appeal put its in the power of the
                                                  strong to oppress the weak by protracted
                                                  litigation. This is especially true of powerful
                                                  moneyed
                                                  corporations. It is in the power of a railroad
                                                  company by making it a practice to contest every
                                                  claim to the utmost possibility to wear out and
                                                  exhaust ordinary litigants by expense and delay,
                                                  and by the example of a few such cases to so
                                                  intimidate the community that men of limited means
                                                  will submit to wrong rather than risk a contest
                                                  with so powerful an adversary, made still more
                                                  powerful by the inefficiency of the law. While it
                                                  is possible so to pervert the law it can not be
                                                  said that justice is administered either
                                                  "completely and without denial"
                                                  or "speedily and without
                                                  delay."
                                             There are some respects also in which the business
                                                  of the court would be greatly benefited by the
                                                  presence of five judges on the bench aside from
                                                  the increased force brought to bear in the
                                                  transaction of business. As organized at present,
                                                  it requires the concurrence of three minds in four
                                                  to decide a cause. The judges are unwilling to
                                                  fail to decide a cause if they can possibly help
                                                  it, and so sometimes spend a much longer time in
                                                  the examination and discussion of one case than
                                                  its importance would otherwise justify,
                                                  endeavoring to bring three of their minds to a
                                                  concurrence upon some decisive view of it. But
                                                  notwithstanding all their efforts they sometimes
                                                  remain equally divided.In such cases the judgment
                                                  of the Court below is affirmed, and if the
                                                  question be of slight importance or rare
                                                  occurrence, little harm is done, but when the
                                                  question is one of practical importance and
                                                  constantly arising in various parts of the State,
                                                  and decided in different ways by the judges of the
                                                  inferior Courts, then the impossibility of
                                                  securing a final and authoritative settlement of
                                                  it by the Supreme Court becomes a public
                                                  calamity.
                                             Precisely such a state of things has occurred in
                                                  regard to the Fee and Salary Bill passed at the
                                                  last session. Upon some of its most important
                                                  features the judges of the Supreme Court are
                                                  divided equally, while the decisions of the
                                                  inferior courts are so conflicting that the law
                                                  upon that subject is in a state of perfect chaos.
                                                  With five judges on the Supreme Bench, such a
                                                  catastrophe would be impossible. Every question
                                                  would be decided in some way, and that without
                                                  unreasonable labor on the part of judges to compel
                                                  their minds to an agreement. We earnestly request,
                                                  therefore, that you increase the number of Supreme
                                                  Judges to five. The number will still be
                                                  insufficient for the work now imposed upon the
                                                  Court, but it is the highest permitted by our
                                                  present Constitution. If it is thought advisable,
                                                  the labor of the Supreme Judges can be very much
                                                  lessened, and the amount of business possible for
                                                  them to transact very much increased, by providing
                                                  them with one or two secretaries, at such salaries
                                                  as will secure educated and competent men; a great
                                                  deal of time and strength of the Judges is
                                                  consumed by labor which could be equally well
                                                  performed by a secretary under their direction. In
                                                  some of the States of the Union, each Judge of the
                                                  Supreme Court is provided with a private secretary
                                                  by the State. We have been directed by the Bar
                                                  Association to ask your attention also to the
                                                  salaries of all our judicial officers. They are
                                                  all too low in every point of view; too low to
                                                  induce suitable men (with rare exceptions) to
                                                  aspire to the Bench; too low to compensate Judges
                                                  for their labor as other men of like ability are
                                                  compensated for like labor; and too low to enable
                                                  them to support their families in such a manner as
                                                  the usages of advancing society demand.
                                             The present salaries of our Judges are very much
                                                  below the average paid in the other States of the
                                                  Union, and greatly below that paid the Judges of
                                                  the Courts of the United States. We have prepared
                                                  and now submit for your consideration, a tabular
                                                  statement of the annual salaries of the Judges of
                                                  the United States, and in most of the States of
                                                  the Union. A few States are omitted for the reason
                                                  that we could not obtain accurate and reliable
                                                  information in regard to their judicial
                                                  salaries:

                                                  by Congress that where any Federal Judge has
                                                  served ten years and reached the age of seventy
                                                  years, he may retire from active service, and
                                                  shall receive during the remainder of his life the
                                                  same salary which he received while in active
                                                  service, while no provision has been made in any
                                                  of the States for the Judges who have worn
                                                  themselves out in the public service; besides, the
                                                  salary, paid to the Judges of the Circuit and
                                                  District Courts, which are nisi
                                                  prius Courts of limited and inferior
                                                  jurisdiction, is much greater than that paid to
                                                  the Supreme Judges of our State. This unjust
                                                  discrimination should no longer be permitted to
                                                  exist.
                                             The great State of Indiana is able to pay her Judges
                                                  such salaries as will induce our ablest lawyers to
                                                  seek and accept positions upon the Supreme and nisi prius benches.
                                             The learning, ability, independence and purity of
                                                  the English Judges may be greatly accounted for
                                                  from the fact that they are appointed for life and
                                                  receive, while in active service, the sum of
                                                  twenty-eight thousand five hundred dollars per
                                                  annum, and when no longer fit for active service,
                                                  they retire upon an allowance amply sufficient to
                                                  support them during their lives. Such salaries
                                                  would, however, be wholly unsuited to our
                                                  institutions and mode of living.
                                             The salaries of our Judges should bear some
                                                  reasonable proportion to the sums that may be made
                                                  in other pursuits of life, and the cost of living
                                                  in the manner expected of those who occupy high
                                                  positions.
                                             We therefore recommend that the annual salary of the
                                                  Supreme Judges should be five thousand dollars;
                                                  that of the Circuit Judges should be thirty-five
                                                  hundred dollars; that of the Common Pleas Judges
                                                  should be twenty-five hundred dollars, and that of
                                                  the Prosecuting Attorney should be one thousand
                                                  dollars, besides the fees now allowed him by
                                                  law.
                                             We beg further to represent as the almost unanimous
                                                  desire of the Bar of the State, that some plan
                                                  should be adopted to effectually carry out the
                                                  provisions of our bill of rights, in regard to the
                                                  speedy administration of Justice. The
                                                  "law's delays" which
                                                  have so long been proverbial, we believe, will be
                                                  found upon proper inquirty, to be the source of
                                                  nearly if not all the serious dificulties and
                                                  hardships of our present system of jurisprudence.
                                                  We believe that more frequent terms of our Circuit
                                                  and Common Pleas Courts would obviate many of the
                                                  more serious defects in our practice and
                                                  proceduce. We believe it is much more important to
                                                  have frequent sessions of our Courts rather than
                                                  more extended ones at long intervals. Under our
                                                  present system the expenses of litigation mainly
                                                  growing out of delays are so enormous as to amount
                                                  to an absolute denial of Justice.
                                             It is a mockery to guarantee rights to men in
                                                  Constitutions and Statutes, and then make the
                                                  expenses and worry of a trial after their rights
                                                  so burdensome as to deter the most wealthy and
                                                  courageous from a contest in our Courts to settle
                                                  their legal controversies.
                                             While it is desirable to lessen the expense of
                                                  litigation as far as possible, both to parties and
                                                  to the public, our observation has suggested to us
                                                  that much might be done in that direction by
                                                  holding an issue term of court shortly before each
                                                  trial term. At the issue term, judgments by
                                                  default and by agreement can be rendered, and ex parte business and all questions
                                                  arising upon the pleadings can be disposed of and
                                                  settled, and the cause put at issue; then, when
                                                  the cause is brought to issue, it would be carried
                                                  to the trial term, which should follow not more
                                                  than two weeks after the close of the issue
                                                  term.
                                             By this arrangement, cases in which witnesses are to
                                                  be examined could be so set upon the docket that
                                                  they could always, or nearly always be tried on
                                                  the day they are set for trial. A large amount of
                                                  cost in this way would always be saved to parties
                                                  in the way of witness fees, and the time of the
                                                  witnesses saved to themselves and to their
                                                  business. Also, a large amount would be saved in
                                                  jurors' fees, the jury only having to
                                                  attend court while there was actual business going
                                                  on requiring their presence.
                                             Some such plan as this, that will secure speed in
                                                  the disposing of cases, and cheapness to the
                                                  parties and the public, will save vastly more to
                                                  the public treasury, to litigants, and to the
                                                  industrial interest of the country than it will
                                                  cost.
                                             We desire to call attention, also, to the very
                                                  meager salary now paid to prosecuting attorneys,
                                                  prosecuting the pleas of the State in the circuit
                                                  courts.This office is one of great importance, and
                                                  should, if possible, at all times be filled by
                                                  thoroughly competent men. At the present salary
                                                  such men can not be induced to accept the office,
                                                  at least if they do accept, it is at a very great
                                                  sacrifice. As a mere question of economy in the
                                                  administration of justice, these officers should
                                                  be putupon a better footing in the matter of their
                                                  salaries. The office, at present salary, can
                                                  command as a general thing only the services of
                                                  the young and inexperienced attorneys. In
                                                  important cases, when the defense, as it usually
                                                  is, is ably represented, the State must be
                                                  comparatively unrepresented, unless the presiding
                                                  Judge shall, to prevent the failure of justice,
                                                  appoint counsel to assist in the prosecution. This
                                                  is frequently done, and that too, in many of the
                                                  cases, at an expense in a single trial more than
                                                  sufficient to pay a competent prosecutor an
                                                  adequate salary for an entire year. So long as the
                                                  State neglects her own interests in this matter,
                                                  so long shall we have just complaints of
                                                  inefficiency in the administration of criminal
                                                  justice. Such complaints are now made, and it can
                                                  not be said that they are without just
                                                  foundation.
                                             All of which is most respectfully submitted by us,
                                                  on behalf of the Bench and Bar of Indiana.

                                                  W. K. MARSHALL.
                                             
                                        
                                   
                              
                              On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, it was laid on the table, and 300 copies
                                   ordered to be printed.
                         
                         
                              THE STATE VS THE TERRE HAUTE AND INDIANAPOLIS
                                   RAILROAD COMPANY.
                              The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Governor
                                   responding to the resolution of the House for information
                                   concerning the State action against the Terre Haute and
                                   Indianapolis Railroad Company for the per cent. of their earnings
                                   pertaining to the school fund, said to exceed a million of
                                   dollars, which was read by the Clerk.
                              The Governor informs the House that he has taken no step in the
                                   matter referred to, for the reason that the joint resolution,
                                   which passed the House at its last session, asking him to take
                                   charge of the said suit, failed to pass the Senate, and he had no
                                   official knowledge of it, except that contained in the resolution
                                   of inquiry, to which this communication was an answer. He further
                                   reports that he has in his possession no facts bearing on the
                                   case; that he had been informed at the time, by J. C. Robinson,
                                   prosecuting attorney, that he had filed a complaint in the Putnam
                                   Circuit Court against the Terre Haute and Indianapolis railroad
                                   for the recovery of certain moneys believed to be due the State
                                   in trust for the school fund (supposed to exceed $1,000,000) by
                                   reason of the company having failed to pay over a certain portion
                                   of her earnings for that purpose, as required by law; that said
                                   Robinson had applied to him for authority to prosecute suit, and
                                   for an appropriation to meet the expenses incurred, and that he
                                   had answered to the effect that if satisfied of the soundness of
                                   the case he would allow, from the contingent fund, a sum
                                   sufficient to meet the necessary expenses; but that since that
                                   time he had received no further communication on the subject from
                                   Robinson. He recommends that the matter be placed in the hands of
                                   the Attorney General or the Judiciary
                                        Committee of the House for further
                                   investigation.
                              On motion of Mr. MILLER it was referred to the Judiciary
                                        Committee with instructions to inquire whether any
                                   further and what legislation
                                   may be necessary to protect the interests of the State.
                              The Governor's communication, with names of prison
                                   convicts who have been pardoned since January 1, 1871, was
                                   referred to the Committee on State
                                   Prisons.
                         
                         
                              U. S. DISTRICT COURT.
                              The Senate joint resolution for instructing Congressmen against the
                                   division of the State into two United States Judicial Districts,
                                   was taken up and adopted on the part of the House of
                                   Representatives.
                         
                         
                              JUSTICE'S JURISDICTION.
                              Mr. WILSON of Ripley, a bill [H. R. 26] to amend section 9 of the
                                   justices act of June 9, 1852, defining their jurisdiction, powers
                                   and duties in civil cases, (making it co-extensive with the
                                   county, and requiring that suits shall be brought in the township
                                   where defendants or one of them resides, or where the debt was
                                   contracted, or the contract made,) was taken up on the third
                                   reading--and the vote resulted, yeas 50, nays 38. So the bill
                                   failed for lack of the Constitutional majority of 51. It lies
                                   over taking place in the calendar for another vote.
                              The concurrent resolution as to prohibiting further letting of
                                   convict labor till after the regmlar session, and as to a system
                                   of graded prisons was taken up and referred to the
                                        Committee on Prisons.
                         
                         
                              THE WORD "WHITE."
                              Mr. SHIRLEY moved that the State Printer be directed to furnish the
                                   House with 300 copies of a map showing the outline of the
                                   counties, and the number of white male inhabitants in each county
                                   according to the last census.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN moved to strike out the word
                                   "white."
                              Mr. SHIRLEY explained that the Constitution of the State required
                                   the apportionment to be made upon the basis of the white
                                   population.
                              Mr. Cauthorn's motion was agreed to, and so the resolution
                                   was adopted.
                              Mr. KING offered a resolution instructing members introducing
                                   bills, to mark on the backs of the same, in pencil, their desire
                                   to be present when the bills are considered in committee, and
                                   directing the committees to notify members of the times when such
                                   bills will be considered, which was adopted.
                              Mr. OFFUTT introduced a bill [H. R. 104] to amend section
                                   seventy-eight of the practice act of June 18, 1852.
                              It was referred to the Committee on the Organization of
                                        Courts.
                              Mr. WOLFLIN offered a resolution providing for the indexing of the
                                   records of the Supreme Court, which was adopted.
                              Mr. SCHMUCK presented a joint resolution relative to the
                                   improvement of the Ohio River, asking of Congress an
                                   appropriation of $2,000,000 for the purpose of making surveys and
                                   establishing reservoirs at the head waters of the Ohio River.
                              It was referred to the Committee on Federal
                                        Relations.
                              The Committee on Mileage and Accounts submitted
                                   an amended report.
                              Mr. KIRKPATRICK moved the printing of 200 copies of the report of
                                   the commissioners to settle the Morgan raid claims.
                              The motion was rejected.
                              On motion of Mr. GIFFORD, the House adjourned till nine
                                   o'clock to-morrow morning.

                              SATURDAY, November 23, 1872.

                         The Secretary's minutes of yesterday's proceedings
                              were read, corrected and approved.
                         
                              PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
                              Mr. BEESON presented a memorial of Indiana yearly meeting of the
                                   Religious Society of Friends, held at Richmond, from the 25th day
                                   of the 9th month to the 1st of the 10th month, inclusive, 1872,
                                   as follows:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             To the Senate and House of
                                                  Representatives of Indiana:
                                             In view of the solemn responsibility resting upon us
                                                  as citizens of the State, and as professors of the
                                                  Christian name, we come before you at this
                                                  time.
                                             We believe that the peace and prosperity of a State
                                                  are secured by the intelligence and virtue of its
                                                  citizens. It is with sadness of heart that we make
                                                  the confession, that licensed intemperance, by its
                                                  ruinous effect upon the conscience, by its injury
                                                  of the mind, health and industry, by its direct
                                                  tendency to crime and every species of degradation
                                                  and immorality, destroys the domestic happiness,
                                                  and increases the poverty of a large number of our
                                                  citizens, and fills our prisons and peoples our
                                                  asylums with its wretched victims.
                                             And believing, as we do, that it is the bounden duty
                                                  of the State, by wise legislation, to protect its
                                                  inhabititants, to encourage the industry and
                                                  morality of its people, as well as prevent crime;
                                                  to promote these, we respectfully, yet earnestly,
                                                  ask that the Legislature enact such laws as will
                                                  entirely prohibit the manufacture and sale of
                                                  intoxicating liquors, to be used as a leverage, in
                                                  the State of Indiana.
                                             Your memorialists will fervently pray that you may,
                                                  by righteous legislation in relation to this
                                                  enormous evil, secure the blessing of God upon our
                                                  State.

                                   lectures on temperance and the divorce law, moved that the
                                   memorials be laid on the table.

                                   referred to the Committee on Claims.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY moved to reconsider the vote of the House adopting his
                                   resolution yesterday, for an order to print 300 maps of the
                                   State--having since learned that the maps will be furnished

                              The SPEAKER. It has been sent to the printer.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY. Still the order can be revoked.
                              
                              The vote was accordingly reconsidered, the resolution laid on the
                                   table, and it was ordered that the printer be notified not to
                                   print it.
                              On motion of Mr. WOOLLEN, Mr. Cauthorn (hearin6 of sickness in his

                                   that the Auditor of State be requested to furnish the House with
                                   such advance sheets of his forthcoming report as relates to the
                                   subject of insurance.
                              On motion of Mr. COBB, it was ordered that when the House shall

                              Mr. WALKER, considering that more business can be done by the
                                   committees than by the House, moved for adjournment.
                              And the House adjourned.

                              Mr. BROWN rose to a privileged question. He presented the

                              The Secretary's minutes of Saturday's proceedings
                                   were being read, when--

                              SESSION BUSINESS.
                              On motion of Mr. BROWN, the order of business was dispensed with,
                                   and the bill [H. R. 22] to amend the act of March 4, 1865,

                              REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                              Favorable reports from a number of committees were received on
                                   several bills, which went to the files to come up in regular
                                   order.
                              Mr. BEESON, from the Committee on Reformatory
                                        Institutions, reported in favor of the passage of
                                   the bill [S. 44] regulating the admission of inmates to the House

                              Mr. GOODING, from the Committee on Judiciary,

                              On motion of Mr. DAGGY, the report was laid on the table.
                              Mr. DAGGY, from the same committee, reported back the bill [S. 13]
                                   requiring railroad companies to keep their principal offices
                                   within the State, and that a majority of the stockholders reside
                                   within the State and along the line of their respective roads,
                                   and recommended that it be referred, to the Committee on

                              Mr. DWIGGINS, from the select committee to whom was referred the
                                   bill [S. 8] to fix the time of holding courts in the Twenty-fifth
                                   Common Pleas District, reported in favor of its passage.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              On motion of Mr. DWIGGINS, the bill [S. 8] to provide for the
                                   holding of courts in the Twenty-fifth Common Pleas District
                                   [Miami and Pulaski counties] was read the second time and ordered
                                   enfrossed for the third reading to-morrow.
                         
                         
                              ALLEGED EMBEZZLEMENT BY A STATE OFFICER.
                              Mr. HALL offered a resolution for the appointment of a committee of
                                   three "to examine the number of warrants and amounts
                                   issued by the United States to any person authorized to receive
                                   such warrant on the part of the State of Indiana, and report if
                                   like amounts have been covered into the State
                                   Treasury."
                              Mr. BROWN wanted to know what the resolution meant. He
                                   couldn't understand the resolution. He objected to it as
                                   being ambiguous in its meaning.
                              Mr. DAGGY also thought it should be modified and made more clear in
                                   its meaning.
                              Mr. HALL thought the meaning was so plain that a wayfaring man,
                                   though a Senator, need not err therein.
                              Mr. BROWN moved to lay the resolution on the table because of its

                              Mr. HALL said he did not believe there was anything wrong in these
                                   accounts, but rumors were current of a large deficit, and he
                                   wanted it investigated.
                              Mr. THOMPON asked if the Senator could specify any officers said to
                                   be guilty of the embezzlement or any administration under which
                                   the deficiency is said to have occurred.
                              Mr. HALL replied that the resolution did not refer to Governor
                                   Baker, whom he believed to be as honest a man as ever lived. But
                                   he was told, before he came to the Senate, that a certain officer
                                   had failed to account for more than $100,000.
                              Mr. BROWN: "Then amend your resolution, name the officer,
                                   and I will vote for it."
                              Several other Senators expressed dissatisfaction with the language
                                   of the resolution as not being sufficiently clear and definite,
                                   and the motion to lay on the table finally prevailed, yeas 28;

                              Pending the roll call--
                              Mr. DAUGHERTY, when his name was called, explained that he would
                                   favor the resolution, were it in proper shape.
                              Mr. GODDING explained his opposition to the resolution, because of
                                   its general character, and because the mover intimates that there
                                   is nothing wrong.
                              Mr. GREGG, in explanation, didn't think it wrong to
                                   investigate such subjects, especially when there is a public
                                   rumor, as stated by the author of the resolution. If it needs
                                   amendment, it can be amended; if not, laid on the table.
                              Mr. HOUGH, in explaining his vote, would not do anything to cover
                                   up wrongdoing by anybody; but didn't think this
                                   resolution in such a shape that it ought to be adopted.
                              The vote was then announced, as above; and so the resolution was
                                   laid on the table.

                                                  Railroad Company, granted and passed January 26,
                                                  1847, provides, in section 23 of said act, that
                                                  certain surplus profits shall be paid over to the

                                                  It is alleged that the said railroad company has
                                                  failed to carry out that provision of its charter
                                                  or act of incorporation, and that it is now
                                                  thereby indebted to the school fund in a large sum
                                                  of money,
                                             BE IT RESOLVED, That it be referred to the
                                                  Committee on Railroads to
                                                  ascertain whether the said Terre Haute and
                                                  Indianapolis Railroad Company has complied with
                                                  the conditions, provisional and obligations set
                                                  forth in section 23 of the act incorporating said
                                                  company, approved January 26, 1847; and that to
                                                  satisfactorily investigate all matters connected
                                                  therewith, the said committee be and is hereby
                                                  authorized to send for and examine the books and
                                                  papers of said company, and to summon and examine
                                                  the officers and employes of said company, and any
                                                  other person and persons whose evidence may be
                                                  necessary to ascertain the facts in the case.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              It was adopted.
                         
                         
                              THE JUDICIARY.
                              Mr. ARMSTRONG offered a resolution, which was adopted, directing
                                   the Committee on Courts to inquire into the
                                   expediency of abolishing the Common Pleas Courts and creating
                                   County Courts in lieu, with powers suggested and set forth in the
                                   said resolution.
                         
                         
                         
                              FOREST TIMBER.
                              Mr. HARNEY offered a resolution that the Committee on
                                        Agriculture inquire into the expediency of
                                   reporting a bill to arrest the destruction of forest trees, and
                                   to encourage their protection and culture. He insisted that we
                                   should put off the time as far as possible when timber should
                                   become scarce in Indiana. This almost indispensable article is
                                   fast disappearing. It is a mistake that men have the absolute
                                   right to utterly impoverish their land by destroying all the
                                   timber growing on it. He wanted a careful examination of the
                                   subject and an early report.
                              Mr. BOONE would prefer that some plans were proposed to accomplish
                                   the purposes desired by the author of the resolution. Many causes
                                   of the utter loss and destruction of timber in this country are
                                   beyond the power of law to remedy.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE thought the resolution would amount to but little
                                   without suggestions accompanying it.
                              The resolution was adopted.
                         
                         
                              SINKING FUND.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS offered a resolution requesting the Auditor of State
                                   to publish two hundred copies of advance sheets of his report in
                                   relation to the sinking fund. He said he had been informed by the
                                   Auditor that there was from $150,000 to $175,000 in the treasury
                                   which really belonged to the school fund, and which is lying
                                   idle.
                              It was adopted.
                         
                         
                              THE SUPREME COURT.
                              Mr. BOONE offered a resolution, which was adopted, that the Clerk
                                   of the Supreme Court report the number of causes on docket on the
                                   first day of January, 1871, and the number of cases docketed to
                                   date; also the number of cases disposed of.
                         
                         
                              OHIO RIVER IMPROVEMENT.
                              Mr. GREGG offered a joint resolution [S. 1] in regard to the
                                   improvement of the Ohio river and its tributaries: That whereas
                                   the Ohio river traverses the southern border of this State for
                                   some 600 miles, and low water and other obstructions render the
                                   stream unnavigable for a large portion of the year; therefore our
                                   representatives in Congress are requested to favor the
                                   improvement of said river and its tributaries by Federal
                                   authorities.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS moved to amend by including the Wabash river.
                              Mr. GREGG accepted the amendment.
                              The joint resolution, as amended, was adopted by yeas, 43; nays,
                                   0.
                         
                         
                              NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                              Bills for acts were introduced, read the first time, and severally
                                   passed to the second reading, except the cases cited.
                              By Mr. HOUGH, a bill [S. 82] for an act to amend section 9 of the
                                   act of May 20, 1852, to provide for the election of electors for
                                   President and Vice-President of the United States.
                              On his further motion the constitutional restriction was dispensed
                                   withby yeas 41; nays, 0; and the bill was read the second time
                                   and ordered engrossed for the third reading. [The bill is made to
                                   conform with the present law of Congress on the subject, fixing
                                   the first Wednesday in December as the day.]
                              The PRESIDENT presented an invitation to the members from Senator
                                   Morton and lady to attend a reception, to be given to-morrow
                                   evening.
                              On motion of Mr. HOUGH the invitation was accepted.
                              By Mr. SMITH, a bill [S. 83] for an act defining the offense of
                                   libel, making the same a misdemeanor, and prescribing punishment
                                   therefor. [It fixes the penalty at a fine not exceeding $1,000,
                                   to which may be added imprisonment in the county jail not
                                   exceeding two years. The third section reads as follows:
                                   "No reporter, editor, or publisher of a newspaper shall
                                   be liable to prosecution under this act for a fair and true
                                   report of any legislative, judicial or public proceedings, or of

                              By Mr. STROUD, a bill [S. 84] for an act to protect the citizens of
                                   the State of Indiana from empyricism, and to protect the citizens
                                   of the State of Indiana.

                              The following described bills were read by title only, and referred
                                   to appropriate committees:
                              Mr. Sleeth's bill [S. 70], making specific appropriations

                              THANKSGIVING RECESS.
                              On motion by Mr. DWIGGINS, the order of business was suspended, and
                                   the message from the House of Representatives transmitting a
                                   concurrent resolution for an adjournment of the General Assembly
                                   over Thanksgiving Day, and until the Monday following at two
                                   o'clock, p. m., was taken up.
                              On his further motion, the resolution was amended by inserting the
                                   words "Senate and" before the word
                                   "House."
                              On motion by Mr. BROWN, the resolution was referred to a committee
                                   of three, to put it in shape agreeing with the constitutional
                                   provision.
                              The PRESIDENT appointed Messrs. Brown, Rosebrugh and Dwiggins as
                                   said committee.
                              On motion, the committee was instructed to report immediately.
                         
                         
                              HOUSE BILLS.
                              On motion by Mr. DWIGGINS, bills from the House of Representatives,
                                   described as follows, were read the first time and passed to the
                                   second reading:
                              The bill [H. R. 7] providing that Justices shall have original
                                   jurisdiction in cases of misdemeanors, in certain cases. [Not
                                   exceeding $25.]
                              The bill [H. R. 27] concerning interests on judgments.
                              The bill [H. R. 32] to provide for Common Pleas terms in the
                                   Fifteenth Judicial District of this State. [The counties of Lake,
                                   Porter, Newton, Jasper arnd Starke.]
                              On motion by Mr. GEEGG, the Senate returned to the order of bills
                                   on the second reading.
                         
                         
                              ROAD ASSESSMENTS.
                              Mr. Miller's bill [ S. 18 ], repealing the plank and
                                   gravel road assessment act, approved May 14, 1869, and the act
                                   authorizing the construction of such roads, approved May 11,
                                   1867, was read the second time.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS referred to the proviso that professes to save vested
                                   rights, and desired the bill should not be rushed through without
                                   careful consideration of that clause. He thought it best to refer
                                   the bill to the Judiciary Committee, and made
                                   that motion in order that the clause referred to may be carefully
                                   examined.
                              Mr. GREGG insisted that the bill has already been carefully
                                   examined by a committee, and that the bill is one that should be
                                   passed without fail at this session of the General Assembly. It
                                   was a measure much desired by the people in a large portion of
                                   the State, and the sending of this bill back to another committee
                                   would but delay the action of the Legislature on this
                                   subject.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN would favor reserving the rights of companies
                                   already organized, and thought this Legislature could do no worse
                                   thing should it repeal the laws for good roads and for ditching
                                   the lands. He favored the motion to refer, simply to get the bill
                                   put of the way for a while. He gave notice that he should oppose
                                   the passage of the bill on its merits. The acts sought to be
                                   repealed enable the collection of a tax to make good roads, from
                                   men who would not otherwise contribute a cent, and thought it a
                                   good law, which ought to stand.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS would make no captious opposition to the bill. His
                                   motion was not made for the purpose of delay, but that the legal
                                   point he referred to should be examined into.
                              The motion to refer the bill to the Judiciary
                                        Committee was agreed to.
                         
                         
                              THANKSGIVING RECESS.
                              Mr. BROWN, from the special committee, returned the concurrent
                                   resolution of the House on the subject of adjourning over
                                   Thanksgiving day, with an amendment striking out the words,
                                   "the House," and inserting in lieu thereof the
                                   words, "each house of the General Assembly of the State
                                   of Indiana."
                              The report was concurred in.
                              On motion of Mr. SLEETH the words, "and consenting
                                   thereto," were stricken out.
                              Mr. DAGGY moved to reconsider the vote by which the resolution was
                                   amended.
                              
                              On motion by Mr. DITTEMORE, this motion to reconsider was laid on
                                   the table.
                              The concurrent resolution of the House, as amended, was
                                   adopted.
                         
                         
                              U. S. BUILDINGS.
                              Mr. THOMPSON'S bill [S. 65], granting the consent of the
                                   State of Indianc to the United States to purchase ground upon
                                   which to erect public buildings, was taken up.
                              Mr. THOMPSON anticipated action by the city to-night on the subject
                                   embraced in that bill, and would prefer it would lay over.
                              It was so ordered.
                              The Senate adjourned till to-morrow at ten o'clock a.
                                   m.

                         HOUSE OF REPEESENTATIVES.
                         
                              MONDAY, November 25, 1872.
                         
                         The House met at two o'clock, p. m.
                         Prayers by the Rev. Benjamin Fulgham, of the Society of Friends.
                         On the motion of Mr. LENFESTY, the reading of the journal of Saturday
                              was dispensed with.
                         Mr. WILLARD moved a call of the House, which determined a quorum, and
                              then, on motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the further proceedings thereunder
                              were dispensed with.
                         
                              REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                              The SPEAKER called for reports from Standing Committees in their
                                   order.
                              Mr. KIMBALL, from the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means returned Mr. Johnson's bill [H. R.
                                   98] making certain specific appropriations, with an amendment
                                   striking out all after the enacting clause, and inserting a
                                   section providing for appropriations to the Normal School, $4,000
                                   to pay borrowed money; to the Governor, $1,189.11 for money paid
                                   for Supreme Court Room; State Prison, South, $12,800; House of
                                   Refuge, $18,000; and the further sums of $3,500 and $4,000 for
                                   current expenses to April, 1873.
                              The report was concurred in, and the bill as amended was ordered to
                                   be engrossed.
                              Mr. HATCH, from the Committee on Swamp Lands,
                                   returned his bill [H. R. 24] and Mr. Henderson's bill
                                   [H. R. 41] for repeal of corporation drainage act, and the act
                                   supplemental thereto, recommending that their consideration be
                                   indefinitely postponed.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              Mr. HEDRICK, from the Committee on Rights and
                                        Privileges, returned Mr. Cole's bill [H.
                                   R. 46] recommending its indefinite postponement.
                              It was concurred in.
                              Mr. PFRIMMER returned Mr. Reno's fish bill [H. R. 52]
                                   recommending its indefinite postponement.
                              Mr. RENO knew that the people of Indiana are tired of the present
                                   fish law. He introduced this bill, which provides for taking fish
                                   at all times. It will be impossible to exhaust the supply of
                                   fish. They will see that we might just as well expect to exhaust
                                   the streams and rivers of water as to exhaust the fish. Besides,
                                   fish are the greatest enemies of fish--greater enemies than man.
                                   Ten thousand fish are eaten by fish where man eats one of them.

                                   was referred to the Committee on Cities and
                                        Towns.

                         IN SENATE.
                         
                              TUESDAY, November 26, 1872.
                         
                         The President called the Senate to order at ten o'clock.

                         The Secretary's minutes of yesterday's proceedings
                              were read, amended and approved.
                         
                              PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
                              The following described petitions and memorials were presented and
                                   referred to appropriate committees:
                              Mr. WINTERBOTHAM presented a petition from citizens of Laporte and
                                   St. Joseph counties, reciting that the act to authorize the
                                   construction of levees, dykes and drains, etc., was passed for
                                   the benefit of a certain company in the northwest part of the
                                   State, and asking for its repeal.
                              It was referred to the Committee on
                                   Corporations.
                              Mr. TAYLOR presented a petition from the Trustees of the State
                                   Agricultural College or Purdue University, setting forth that the
                                   present currency value of the fund derived from the sale of
                                   land-scrip for the University is $314,067 52, yielding an annual
                                   interest of $15,000 in gold and $1,200 in currency; that a law is
                                   nowpending before Congress, which will probably pass, donating
                                   one million of acres of land to each Agricultural College; that
                                   Mr. Purdue has agreed to give $150,000, in yearly installments,
                                   Tippecanoe county $50,000, and that the University had other
                                   sources of revenue; that they had commenced the erection of
                                   buildings, etc., for said college for which $167,000 would be
                                   required between now and next midsummer to provide them for the
                                   reception of students, and the trustees will have but $40,000
                                   coming in to meet the requirement. They therefore ask for an
                                   appropriation of $100,000.
                              It was referred to the Committee on
                                   Education.
                              Mr. HUBBARD presented other petitions in relation to the repeal of
                                   the drainage law, which were referred to the Committee
                                        on Corporations.
                         
                         
                              THE WABASH AND ERIE CANAL BONDS
                              The PRESIDENT presented a communication from the trustees of the
                                   Wabash & Erie canal, inclosing a memorial from the
                                   stockholders of canal certificates. The memorial recites that the
                                   subscribers were the owners of certian bonds issued from 1832 to
                                   1836, which they were induced to surrender under the promises and
                                   provisions of the acts of 1846-7, which not only guarantee to
                                   them the tolls and revenues of the canal for the redemption of
                                   principal and interest for their bonds, but also expressly
                                   provided that the State would make no provision thereafter to pay
                                   either principal or interest on any internal improvement bond
                                   until the holders should have first surrendered said bonds to the
                                   agent of the State and have received in lieu thereof certificates
                                   of stock. They are now informed that application has been or will be made to the General
                                   Assembly to provide for the redemption in cash of certain
                                   outstanding original State bonds in violation of said proviso and
                                   of the said acts of the assembly, and contrary to the good faith
                                   of the State. They therefore protest against any provision for
                                   the payment of any of the bonds of the State contrary to said
                                   proviso and request that their protest may be placed on the
                                   record. Should, however, the General Assembly redeem in cash said
                                   outstanding bonds the subscribers insist that the same provision
                                   should be made for the payment of the principal and interest of
                                   their certificates.
                              The memorial is signed by Dent, Palmer and Co., N. M. Rothschild
                                   and Sons, Baring Bors. and Co., London Committee, and Frederick
                                   Hunt and Co., George Mosle, August Belmont and A. Gracie King,
                                   New York Committee.
                              Mr. CHAPMAN moved that the memorial be referred to the
                                        Committee on the Judiciary.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved to amend by laying it on the table.
                              Mr. BROWN hoped the Senator (Mr. Dwiggins) would withdraw that
                                   motion. What is the object of laying it on the table?
                              Mr. DWIGGINS: To dispose of it.
                              Mr. BROWN: Why dispose of it in that way?
                              Mr. DWIGGINS: It is the best way. We have had enough of these
                                   memorials.
                              Mr. BROWN : The statements made in the memorial in reference to the
                                   acts of 1846 and 1847 were totally without foundation, and the
                                   Senate owed it to the State to make some reply to the memorial.
                                   In his judgment, there were many things in it in utter violation
                                   of the law of 1846-7. He thought we owed it to the State to reply
                                   to it. The proviso referred to in it is utterly void and has been
                                   so held by the Supreme Court and so recognized by every lawyer in
                                   the State, and he thought the honor of the State would be better
                                   vindicated by replying to it than by laying it on the table.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS thought we had fully answered these gentlemen before.
                                   They have been here time after time and term after term of the
                                   legislature, knocking at the door of the treasury for the payment
                                   of these bonds. They had been fully answered heretofore, and it
                                   seemed to him, they were not entitled to further answer at the
                                   hands of the Senate. He moved to indefinitely postpone the
                                   memorial.
                              Mr. BROWN. The Senator, with all his zeal, ought not to forget that
                                   the Constitution of the State provides that any person may
                                   petition the General Assembly, and that constitutional provision
                                   means that petitions shall be respectfully treated. This is in
                                   the nature of a petition, and the zeal of the Senator should not
                                   carry him away from his rightful obligation to the Constitution.
                                   There are Senators differing in opinion in reference to the
                                   payment of these internal improvement bonds. He held the opinion
                                   that he expressed in the Senate two years ago, that while these
                                   bonds are a paramount lien on the Wabash and Erie
                                   Canal--paramount to the trust deed conveying the land to the
                                   Board of Trustees, and to the deed in fee simple, conveying away
                                   800,000 acres of land. He believed that a fair construction of
                                   the law and the contract, and the maintenance of good faith
                                   pledged by the people and accepted by those who took the canal
                                   and the lands, means this, that they took it upon the condition,
                                   or rather took it with the hazard and expectancy that all the
                                   holders of internal improvement bonds would come in and make
                                   themselves parties to the contract, and that the whole
                                   improvement debt would be discharged according to the funded debt
                                   bills. There are others, however, who seem to be exceedingly
                                   forward in protecting the State against the admission of the
                                   canal debt, who believe that the legislative contract of 1846-7
                                   was but a cancellation of the surrendered debt as between the
                                   State and those who surrendered the debt, and that it had nothing
                                   whatever to do with the adjustment of the unsurrendered portion
                                   of the debt. I believe the man who says that the legislative
                                   contract of 1846 and 1847 was an adjustment of the whole debt is
                                   the man who correctly construes the act and the best friend of
                                   the people of Indiana upon that subject.
                              But, be that as it may, so far as the pay of the internal
                                   improvement bonds are concerned, I, for one, do not believe that
                                   that act will give the holders of internal improvement bonds any
                                   legal or equitable claim upon the State for the payment of their
                                   stocks, for these reasons tbat if it was a breach of the
                                   legislative contract of 1846 and 1847 it would be a breach of
                                   contract without injury or damage to either of the parties to the
                                   contract, and that a breach of contract without injury or damage
                                   gives no person a right of action either in law or equity. The
                                   Legislature may perhaps pass these bonds without incurring any
                                   liability, moral or legal, for the payment of the canal scrip.
                                   But lawyers differ about it, and it seems to me that the Senate
                                   owes it to our dignity and its own self-respect to answer this
                                   claim set up in this memoral, that if the Legis- lature does take up these three
                                   hundred and odd thousand, she, by that act, places herself
                                   equitably and legally bound for the payment of the eighteen
                                   millions of canal stock. And an indefinite postponement does not
                                   obviate the notice that these men pretend to give, and it is in
                                   violation of the constitutional provision that any citizen may
                                   petition the General Assembly, which means that the petition
                                   should be heard with decency and respect.
                              Mr. STEELE said he was sorry that this troublesome question was
                                   presented at this time. It had been before the Legislature at
                                   least three times and fully answered. The holders of bonds surely
                                   know by this time the position that Indiana takes in regard to
                                   those surrendered bonds. He was not aware of the difference of
                                   opinion that the Senator from Jackson [Mr. Brown] spoke of to any
                                   great extent.
                              He believed the opinion of the bar of Indiana, that the legal
                                   opinion of the State had been well understood, that these bonds
                                   were not payable by the State of Indiana; that is, those that
                                   were not surrendered. The opinion of the Senator from Jackson,
                                   given two years ago, was regarded as his opinion merely, and of
                                   no other legal mind in the State that he knew of. He asked
                                   whether or not it did not smack of repudiation to say that we
                                   will not honor our contracts nor pay those bonds that never have
                                   been surrendered under the legislation of 1846-7. Those bonds
                                   bear the signature of the State of Indiana. They are promises to
                                   pay, and are presented to the Auditor of State, asking that they
                                   be paid in compliance with the conditions named in the bonds
                                   themselves. The member from Jackson would say to them, Indiana
                                   has made a provision with Mr. Butler, and those he represented,
                                   that that they should pay the indebtedness of the State of
                                   Indiana. Is that the answer to be made to those who present those
                                   bonds that never were delivered up under the Butler bill? It is
                                   true we made these bonds and agreed to pay them, but outside of
                                   that we made an arrangement with a third party that they should
                                   pay them, those men holding these bonds taking no notice of the
                                   arrangement made between the State and Mr. Butler. The question
                                   arises, then, does it bind them at all? He submitted that Indiana
                                   should make provision for every dollar she owes, whether it is
                                   these bonds or any other indebtedness. We are not in a condition
                                   to repudiate any of our contracts. We are in a condition to pay
                                   every dollar that we owe. Coming in the way it does, it is no
                                   less repudiation than to turn upon any other contract and refuse
                                   to pay it.
                              Mr. HALL. When these 191 bonds were left out in the cold, did the
                                   Butler bill provide for taking them up?
                              Mr. BROWN. I want to state, once for all, in order that the Senator
                                   from Grant (Mr. Steele) especially may know, that every act of
                                   mine hitherto has been with an eye single to saving the State
                                   from incurring any legal or moral liability for the payment of
                                   these canal stocks. The Senator is at fault in his understanding
                                   of the law when he proposes to contradict what I said, that the
                                   proviso to the eighth section of the act of 1846 is a nullity.
                                   That proviso is in these words: "Provided that the State
                                   will make no provision whatever hereafter to pay either principal
                                   or interest on any internal improvement bond or bonds until the
                                   holder or holders thereof shall have first surrendered such bonds
                                   to the agent of the State, and shall have received in lieu
                                   thereof certificates of stock as provided in the first section of
                                   this act, anything in this act to the contrary
                                   notwithstanding." That proviso is null and void as to
                                   the unsurrendered bonds, and has been so declared by the Supreme
                                   Court of the United States.
                              The proposition that I submitted two years ago I maintain yet, and
                                   it is this: The State of Indiana was in debt by reason of her
                                   engagement in the internal improvement of the State, to rising of
                                   $15,000,000. Her creditors were demanding an adjustment of their
                                   claims. Their claim was not a claim by taxation upon the people
                                   of the State in the first instance and that is where the Senator
                                   gets himself in deep water.
                              Their claim was a charge upon a portion of the State's
                                   property and not a charge upon the taxing power of the State to
                                   assess taxes upon the people in order to provide funds for the
                                   liquidation of the debt. The internal improvement act expressly
                                   provided that for the payment of the internal improvement bonds
                                   the lots, lands and revenues of said canal should be applied to
                                   the liquidation of the State debt, and the State guaranteed that
                                   these revenues should be sufficient. She stood then in relation
                                   of a guarantor only, pledging that a certain public work would
                                   liquidate the debt. The State guaranteed this, that if these
                                   public works, in the natural exercise of them, should not afford
                                   revenues sufficient for the adjustment and liquidation of the
                                   debt, she then was bound to make the deficiency good. Every
                                   holder of an internal improvement bond unsurrendered has every
                                   claim, legal and equit- able, for the liquidation and payment of his bond to-day that
                                   he ever had.
                              I said a moment ago that these bonds were a paramount lien upon
                                   these public works, and that is all that the law and the contract
                                   of 1846-7 ever made them. I say more than that, that the State is
                                   bound by the law and contract as a guarantor that those public
                                   works will pay the debt, and whenever these public works are
                                   exhausted, and by their exhaustion it is found that any of these
                                   improvement bonds are nnpaid, then the holder of them has a claim
                                   on the people by direct taxation, to create funds for the
                                   liquidation and payment of these bonds. So when the Senator talks
                                   about repudiation he ought to understand that a candid and, in my
                                   judgment, a sensible examination of the rights and liabilities of
                                   the State under this contract saves the State's honor
                                   from repudiation by a faithful execution of the contract, and not
                                   otherwise.
                              The adjustment made between the State and its creditors was as
                                   follows: They agreed that upon the transfer of the Wabash and
                                   Erie Canal and its lands, tolls, proceeds and revenues, they
                                   would assume one-half of the entire debt of the State, and for
                                   the other half the State then pledged her faith that by taxation
                                   she would liquidate and pay it. That agreement, made between the
                                   State on one side and her creditors on the other side, was a
                                   complete settlement or adjustment of the whole debt as between
                                   the State and those who surrendered, but did not disturb at all
                                   the rights of those who did not surrender. But those who did
                                   surrender incurred voluntarily the liability to discharge
                                   one-half the entire debt of the State, and the language of the
                                   funded debt bills so means and does not mean anything else.
                              [Mr. BROWN here quoted from a message of Governor Baker to prove
                                   that the Governor agreed with him in the construction of the act.
                                   He feared that the payment of these outstanding bonds would
                                   create a liability on the part of the State for the payment of
                                   the original debt.]
                              Mr. BROWN said that the bonds, principal and interest, would amount
                                   to about nine hundred thousand dollars, and asked who was the
                                   better friend of the Statehe who said that this sum should be
                                   taken up by the stockholders of the Wabash and Erie Canal, and
                                   adjusted by the State according to the funded debt bills, or he
                                   who insisted that the State should forget her contract and throw
                                   that large burden upon the people to be paid by direct
                                   taxation?
                              He said that these gentlemen, instead of standing by and seeing the
                                   order of the Carroll Circuit Court executed upon them in allowing
                                   their trust property to be placed in the hands of a trustee,
                                   appointed for the purpose of collecting tolls and paying off the
                                   full amount of these obligations, should discharae these
                                   obligations themselves, and they then would have a upon the State
                                   for the liquidation of one half of them according to the law and
                                   the contract.
                              It is claimed that the settlement of 1846-7 was only for one half
                                   of the surrendered debt. It is strange that the good, able and
                                   intelligent men who framed this legislative contract, they who
                                   lived for years as interpreters of the true intent and meaning of
                                   it--that the holders of this canal scrip should live with this
                                   contract before them for years, and that they and those
                                   representing the honor and integrity of the State should never
                                   discover until the Senator from Grant got into the Indiana
                                   Legislator, that this adjustment liquidated but one half of the
                                   surrendered debt, and not half of the entire debt.
                              The entire transaction, the true interpretation of the act, the
                                   meaning of the General Assembly, the conduct of Governor after
                                   Governor, the action and conduct of Federal administration after
                                   Federal administration, action of and conduct of the holders of
                                   these canal stocks, and of the internal improvement bonds for
                                   years, show that the adjustment made by this law was understood
                                   to discharge the State from any legal or moral liability for the
                                   payment of one half of the entire debt.
                              At the conclusion of Mr. Brown's argument
                              Mr. STEELE again took the floor in reply. He said Mr. Brown claimed
                                   that the State was only a guarantor. This was truly an
                                   extraordinary proposition, when the bonds contained the express
                                   promise of the State to pay a certain sum with interest at
                                   certain dates. Again, the Supreme Court has decided that,
                                   although the State and Mr. Butler may have intended to bind those
                                   who did not surrender their bonds, they had no constitutional
                                   right to do so, and the contract of 1846-7 did not affect them.
                                   He maintained that under that contract the State was bound to
                                   protect those who surrendered their bonds in the possession of
                                   the canal and its appurtenances, and that if the State allowed
                                   the canal to be swept away from under them, she would become
                                   liable to them for the whole amount of the bonds surrendered. He
                                   contended that those parties that had no notice of the
                                   arrangement betwixt Mr. Butler and the State the State refusing to pay these
                                   bonds at the time they fall due, in that event becomes a
                                   repudiation of her contract, and she cannot escape from it. Mr.
                                   S. proceeded to argue the question, referring to the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS of last session to support his
                                   statements with reference to the proceedings on this question,
                                   his remarks being interrupted by the special order under a joint
                                   resolution of the two Houses, and in pursuance to an act of
                                   Congress, viz: a vote for United States Senator.
                         
                         
                              ELECTION OF U. S. SENATOR.
                              Twelve o'clock having arrived, the special order for that
                                   hour, the election of United States Senator was taken up.
                              Mr. TAYLOR took great pleasure in behalf of the Republicans of
                                   Indiana in nominating for the position of United States Senator,
                                   the Hon. Oliver P. Morton, of Marion county.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE put in nomination for the same position the Hon.
                                   James D. Williams, of Knox county.
                              There being no further nominations, the vote resulted as
                                   follows:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             Those who voted for Mr. Morton were--Messrs.
                                                  Beardsley, Beeson, Brown, Bunyan, Chapman,
                                                  Collett, Daggy, Dwiggins, Freidley of Scott,
                                                  Gooding, Haworth, Hough, Howard, Hubbard, Miller,
                                                  Neff, O'Brien, Oliver, Orr, Rhodes,
                                                  Scott, Sleeth, Steele, Taylor, Thompson, Wadge and
                                                  Mr. President--27.
                                             Thsoe who voted for Mr. Williams were--Messrs.
                                                  Armstrong, Beggs, Bird, Boone, Bowman, Carnahan,
                                                  Cave, Daugherty, Dittemore, Francisco, Glessner,
                                                  Gregg, Hall, Harney, Ringo, Rosebrugh,
                                                  Sarnighausen, Slater, Smith, Stroud, and
                                                  Winterbotham--21.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Pending the roll call, when the Secretary reached Mr.
                                   Fuller's name--Mr. CARNAHAN said that Mr. Fuller was
                                   confined to his bed by sickness, but if he were here he would
                                   vote for Mr. Williams.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS, when his name was called, declined to vote for
                                   himself.
                              The PRESIDENT then announced the vote as above recorded, and said:
                                   Oliver P. Morton has received a majority of all the votes cast in
                                   the Senate for United Senator.
                              Mr. TAYLOR offered the following resolution:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, By the Senate, the
                                                  House of Representatives concurring therein, That
                                                  both houses will meet in joint convention at
                                                  twelve o'clock m, of tomorrow, in the
                                                  hall of the House of Representatives, to compare
                                                  and announce the vote for United States Sentor, in
                                                  compliance with an act of Congress.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              The resolution was adopted, and then the Senate took a recess until
                                   two o'clock, p. m.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The Senate met at two o'clock, p. m.
                              Mr. TAYLOR, by consent, offered a resolution, which was adopted,
                                   inviting the members of the Cattle Breeders' Association
                                   about to hold a session in the city, to visit the Senate Chamber
                                   during their stay in the capital of Indiana.
                         
                         
                              WABASH AND ERIE CANAL.
                              The Senate recurred to the business pending at the time of its
                                   interruption by the voting for United States Senator just before
                                   the recess for dinner.
                              Mr. STEELE being entitled to the floor resumed and concluded his
                                   argument, insisting that it was trifling with the General
                                   Assembly of the State of Indiana for the memorialists to come
                                   here from year to year, and from session to session with their
                                   petitions, for when we are asked a plain question and answer it
                                   once, that should be sufficient, and when we answer it twice,
                                   that should be satisfactory, but they have been answered a half a
                                   dozen times, and still they come and ask us to again consider
                                   their claims. He hoped that the Senate would at once dispose of
                                   this matter by indefinitely postponing it.
                              He read the obligation contained in the bonds issued prior to the
                                   Butler bill, whereby the faith of the State was irrevocably
                                   pledged to their payment, contending that the State was primarily
                                   responsible for them and not as a guarantor. He also read the
                                   syllabus in Black's U. S. Court Reports referred to by
                                   him in the morning, to prove that the settlement provided for by
                                   the Butler bill in no way affected the status or claims of those
                                   creditors who had not surrendered their bonds.
                              He would not take up the time of the Senate in discussing the
                                   question as fully as it may be his privilege at the proper time.
                                   The question now is simply this: Shall we take up the time of the
                                   Senate, and appoint a committee to consider a matter that has
                                   been presented here from time to time ever since 1857? There has
                                   been sufficient answer made to enable these parties to understand
                                   that the State never intends to pay one dollar of these bonds,
                                   for she has paid her half as she agreed to.
                              Mr. GLESSNER insisted that this memorial is in a little different
                                   attitude from any other memorial that has ever been presented to
                                   the Legislature on this subject. He said the memorial had a major
                                   and a minor proposition. While he would be in favor of voting for
                                   indefinite postponement of this proposition for the pay- ment of tkese surrendered
                                   bonds, he might not be in a condition to vote for the indefinite
                                   postponement of the major proposition that we would
                                   unconditionally pay those unsurrendered bonds. This is still a
                                   mooted question. It has occurred to him that perhaps the State
                                   might as well pay those unsurrendered bonds and that they would
                                   then be subrogated to the rights of those holding canal
                                   certificates. But when you come to discuss these several
                                   questions it is one of great doubt, one that the best lawyers of
                                   the State are divided upon. He recollected that during the last
                                   political campaign it was charged by certain radical politicians,
                                   with their usual unfair way of presenting a political question on
                                   the Democratic party, that it was in favor of paying not only the
                                   unsurrendered but the surrendered canal bonds, while on the other
                                   hand, the truth is, that two years ago when this question was
                                   presented to the Senate, upon a proposed amendment to the
                                   Constitution of the State providing against the action of future
                                   legislation in behalf of these men who surrendered their canal
                                   bonds, there was only one dissenting voice. I believe every
                                   Democrat in the Senate voted in favor of the amendment to the
                                   Constitution while many on the other side of the Senate were in
                                   favor of saying at once that they would pay those bonds that were
                                   unsurrendered. On this side of the Senate Chamber a majority of
                                   the voice of the Democratic party was on the other side of that
                                   question, for the reason that there were some unsettled questions
                                   connected with it. But notwithstanding the records show that the
                                   Democratic party is right on this question--not only opposed to
                                   paying the surrendered bonds but also the unsurrendered
                                   bonds--and inasmuch as no doubt many members of the Senate were
                                   unprepared to vote, he was opposed to the indefinite
                                   postponement.
                              Why not let this memorial go to a Standing Committee of the Senate?
                                   By the time a committee would consider it the Senate will be
                                   better prepared to determine as to whether they are willing to
                                   pay these bonds or not. By the time a report is made from a
                                   committee Senators can vote with satisfaction to themselves.
                                   While if a vote be pressed to-day they will vote with uncertainty
                                   in their minds as to whether they are voting right or wrong.
                                   While there are doubts as to which is the right and which the
                                   wrong side, it is better for the interest of the State that the
                                   matter be deferred and investigated until the Senate can
                                   discharge its duty with a proper understanding. The propositions
                                   are so interwoven they cannot be divided, otherwise he would
                                   favor the indefinite postponement of the minor proposition and be
                                   in favor of referring the major proposition to a committee.
                              Mr. HARNEY said he had examined the memorial carefully and could
                                   not discover that it meant anything except a notice to the
                                   Senate. There were no questions asked: nothing for them to
                                   answer, nothing to refer. It is a protest against a certain act
                                   that we may do, and a notice that they would take a certain
                                   position in that contingency. For us to indefinitely postpone it
                                   would be a manifest impropriety. So far as I am concerned I am
                                   glad that the bondholders have given us this notice. Heretofore
                                   we have stood in doubt as to what position they occupied on the
                                   question. They have occupied a position a good deal like Lorenzo
                                   Dow said the doctrine of reprobation was, whether one took one
                                   position or the other, the result is the same. If we paid the
                                   Garrett bonds they were going to make us pay the canal debt for
                                   that reason. If we didn't pay those bonds, and the canal
                                   passed from their holding, therefore, again, we should pay it. In
                                   this memorial they distinctly take the position that we may
                                   refuse to pay those bonds, and let the canal be sold and pass
                                   into the hands of the parties now contending for it without
                                   injuring ourselves, because, with a full notice of all the facts
                                   in the case, they serve on us an official notice that it is our
                                   business to stand aside in that fight, that it is no concern of
                                   ours at all, that whatever may be the result it will affect our
                                   action in no sense. We should not deny ourselves the benefit of
                                   that view, for it may be of service to us. Therefore it would be
                                   manifest impropriety to indefinitely postpone this memorial.
                              Mr. DAGGY agreed with the Senator from Montgomery (Mr. Harney) as
                                   to the construction of the memorial. He thought it was out of
                                   time and out of place. The payment of a portion of the
                                   outstanding bonds would not hurt those who hold canal
                                   certificates. There is evidently a covert design in this
                                   memorial. It is a notice and it is a protest. If they will say
                                   that if the Legislature fails to pay these bonds they will stand
                                   the liability, then we would have an estopped on them, but they
                                   don't say that much. They go just so far and stop. They
                                   don't go far enough. It is delusive--almost like the
                                   argument of the Senator from Jackson (Mr. Brown), with all due
                                   deference to that Senator. As it now stands, he should vote all
                                   the time against them in every shape they show their heads. But there is being
                                   discussed a question that is not before the Senate at all. That
                                   question will come up when the bill is before us for the payment
                                   of these bonds, therefore he declined to enter into a legal
                                   discussion of the subject. This is simply a protest, saying:
                                   "Don't you legislate on that subject."
                                   He was for determining this question at once and forever, and in
                                   favor of indefinite postponement.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS made the point of order that parliamentary law forbids
                                   the discussion now being indulged in, in support of which he read
                                   from Jefferson's Manual, page 47.
                              The PRESIDENT decided the point of order not well taken.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS too, thought that the memorial was out of time and out
                                   of place. They say to us "we object,"
                                   "we protest against your paying anybody's
                                   bonds." They say, "you dare to pay those bonds
                                   and you must pay our bonds or else you do us injustice."
                                   Suppose we decline to pay Mr. Garrett's judgment, and
                                   the canal is sold, passes out of the hands of the Trustees
                                   appointed under the Butler law, they will say that the revenues
                                   of the canal were guaranteed to them by the act of 1846-7 for the
                                   payment of their bonds and the interest, and we have violated the
                                   contract, deprived them of the rents and tolls, and therefore we
                                   must pay them the whole amount of the interest and principal.
                                   That is what they want, that we should let Garrett sell the canal
                                   so that they may claim payment of the whole amount of the bonds.
                                   That is the reason of this protest and nothing else. Why is it
                                   they are so anxious to come forward and say to the State
                                   "you must not pay a certain debt?" Why? Why are
                                   those men in London and New York so interested? Because they want
                                   us to let the canal be sold so they can then come in and say,
                                   "you violated your part of the contract and must pay
                                   us." This is the reason. Therefore he moved to
                                   indefinitely postpone this memorial and the subjectmatter it
                                   contains.
                              Mr. BROWN took the floor again and contended that it was the
                                   business of the sureties of the canal to defend the Garrett suit.
                                   They took the property with the incumbrance upon it, as a man
                                   takes a piece of real property with a mortgage on it, and they
                                   were bound to defend their right of possession against the person
                                   holding the incumbrance. The conveyance of the property by the
                                   State to the trustees created prior incumbrances, paramount liens
                                   which they could defend against all comers and were bound so to
                                   do.
                              He believed the best interests of the State demand that the
                                   Legislature should not undertake to interfere with the adjustment
                                   of this old internal improvement debt, because the adjustment of
                                   1846-7 was a finality, and the people demand a faithful
                                   recognition of the obligation imposed by that adjustment. He
                                   plead for the upholding of that law and that adjustment, and not
                                   for the striking down of it. He was not one of the number of
                                   these, if any such number there are, who believe that the
                                   Legfslation of 1846-7 has affected or disturbed the rights in the
                                   least regard whatever, that the holders of the Internal Revenue
                                   Bonds obtained against the State the very moment they became the
                                   purchasers and owners of their bonds. These rights belong to them
                                   as completely now as ever, and it does not lie in the power of
                                   subsequent legislation to destroy these rights.
                              Were the holders to demand the liquidation of these bonds he would
                                   not lay a burden upon the industries and the labor of the people
                                   of Indiana to create a fund by taxation for the liquidation and
                                   payment of these bonds, but would turn to the law of 1836, and
                                   read to the holder these words: "For the punctual
                                   payment of the interest and final redemption of," etc.
                                   He would say to the holder of such bond: "When you took
                                   that bond you took it in pursuance of that act, and the people of
                                   Indiana by the law which authorized its issue agreed that the
                                   payment of it in the first instance was to be charged upon these
                                   public works, and it is a duty which lies upon you to exhaust
                                   these public works before you call upon the people to be taxed to
                                   pay your bonds." He would stand by the law of 1836 and
                                   would not be bringing repudiation upon the State, but holding to
                                   a faithful recognition of the law and the contract.
                              Mr. B. again insisted on the right of any person to petition the
                                   General Assembly, and the obligation which rested on the Senate
                                   to treat this communication respectfully.
                              At the close of his spoech he moved to lay the memorial on the
                                   table, in accordance with a promise to Mr. Glessner, who had made
                                   that motion, but withdrew it to allow Mr. Brown the floor; and
                                   the motion prevailed by a very large majority.
                         
                         
                              THE NEW STATE HOUSE.
                              The PRESIDENT laid before the Senate a communication transmitting
                                   resolutions adopted by the Common Council of the city of
                                   Indianapolis, as follows:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             WHEREAS, The north half of square
                                                  No. 48, commonly called West Market square, was
                                                  dedicated by the State to the city for the purpose of a
                                                  market space, and if the same should be applied to
                                                  any other use, it would revert to the original
                                                  grantor, the State of Indiana, and
                                             WHEREAS, It is for the benefit of
                                                  the city and of the State that the new State House
                                                  shall be erected on the prgsent site ; therefore,

                                                  build, shall be erected upon or near the present
                                                  site, and that said part of square 48 shall be
                                                  used as part of the State House grounds, the city

                              It was referred to the Committee on Public
                                        Buildings.

                              The PRESIDENT also presented a communication from the Auditor of

                                   mortgagees to enter satisfaction of mortgage when paid.
                              It was concurred in.
                              Mr. STEELE, from the same committee, reported in favor of the
                                   indefinite postponement of the bill [S. 17] increasing the
                                   jurisdiction of justices of the peace.
                              On motion of Mr. WILLIAMS, the report was so amended as to lay the

                              CLAIMS.
                              A report from the Committee on Claims made an
                                   allowance of $20 for services in draping the Senate Chamber in
                                   mourning, was amended by Mr. DWIGGINS, by authorizing the Auditor
                                   to pay the claim.
                              Mr. HOUGH moved to amend by reducing the sum to $15, as the bill
                                   only includes the services for hanging the drapery, and the pay
                                   would be in excess of the per diem allowed secretaries and other
                                   employes of the Senate.
                              Mr. ORR moved to lay the amendment on the table.
                              This motion was rejected by yeas 23, nays 24.
                              The amendment to strike out "$20" and insert
                                   "$15," was then rejected.
                              The report of the committee was concurred in.
                              Mr. ORR, from the Committee on Claims, returned
                                   the bill of The People for furnishing
                                   newspapers, wrapped and stamped, during the session of 1871, with
                                   a recommendation that it be not allowed.
                              Mr. SLATER inquired whether these papers were not received and
                                   used.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE thought they had been received and used, and ought to
                                   be paid for.
                              The report was concurred in.

                                   bonds or stocks of the state. [It proposes to appropriate such
                                   sums of money as may be necessary to redeem 191 bonds and their
                                   coupons, such as are described in the preamble to the bill.]

                              The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from Thomas
                                   Dowling, resident Trustee of the Wabash and Erie canal, inclosing
                                   a memorial from the London and New York committees representing
                                   the holders of Indiana canal certificates. The memorial sets
                                   forth that the memorialists originally held the bonds of the
                                   State issued under various acts from 1832 to 1836, which bonds
                                   they were induced to surrender under the promises and provisions
                                   of the acts of 1846 and 1847, which guaranteed to them the tolls
                                   and revenues of the canal for the redemption of the principal and
                                   interest of their bonds, and expressly declared that the State
                                   would thereafter make no provision to pay principal or interest
                                   on any internal improvement bond or bonds, until the same should
                                   be surrendered and the holders accepted in lieu thereof
                                   certificates of stock, as provided in the act of 1847; that they
                                   are now informed a movement is on foot to provide for the
                                   redemption of certain unsurrendered bonds in violation of the
                                   provision of the said act, and contrary to good faith; and they
                                   therefore protest against any step being taken for the payment of
                                   any bonds so outstanding unless like provision be made for the
                                   payment of the bonds surrendered under provisions of the act of
                                   1847. They ask, however, if the State shall deem it wise in the
                                   maintenance of her credit to redeem in cash the outstanding bonds
                                   that similar provision be made for the payment of the principal
                                   and interest of the canal certificates. The memorial is signed by

                              On motion of Mr. CAUTHORN the matter was referred to the Judiciary

                                   rebellion, to favor the passage by Congress of a law giving all
                                   honorably discharged soldiers a bounty equal to $8.33 1-3 per

                                   on enclosed land without consent of the owner or occupant, and
                                   providing a penalty not less than $5 nor more than $50, providing
                                   that suits shall be brought within one year by the owner of the land, was taken up in
                                   order and finally passed the House by yeas, 69; nays, 18.

                                   1861, providing for the redemption of real property sold on
                                   execution or order of sale, etc., was taken up, considered on the
                                   third reading and rejected--yeas 17, nays 71.

                                   BONDS.
                              Mr. KIMBALL asked and obtained unanimous consent to introduce a
                                   bill [H. R. 129] for an act to protect the Wabash and Erie Canal
                                   and the tolls and revenues thereof, from sale or sequestration on
                                   account of outstanding and unsurrendered canal bonds or stock or
                                   from unsurrenred Internal improvement bonds, etc. [It approprites
                                   money sufficient to redeem the bonds forming the basis of the
                                   suit and judgment of John W. Garrett to an amount not exceeding
                                   191 of the 5 per cent. bonds,] He moved that it be referred to
                                   the Committee on Ways and Means, but on motion
                                   of Mr. Cauthorn it was laid on the table and ordered to be
                                   printed.
                         
                         
                              TWENTY-SECOND JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.
                              Mr. Cowgill's bill [H. R. 49] creating the twenty-second
                                   Judicial Circuit of Indiana, and fixing the time of holding court
                                   therein, was considered on the third reading.
                              [It constitutes the counties of Huntington, Wabash, and Miami, the
                                   Twenty-second Judicial Circuit, and fixes the time of holding
                                   courts therein.]
                              Mr. COWGILL set forth the necessity and desirability of this
                                   bill.
                              Mr, WOOLEN considered that we should be careful about falling into
                                   the error of too greatly increasing the number of circuits, and
                                   at the same time increasing the salary of the Judges.
                              Messrs. COWGILL and GREGORY reiterated the importance of the
                                   bill.
                              Mr. GIVEN suggested that there is now a circuit numbered
                                   twenty-second.
                              Mr. COWGILL said there is not a twenty-second circuit, and in reply
                                   to Mr. Johnson and others, he showed that those three counties
                                   will afford as much business as the Judge can get through with.
                                   The bill then finally passed the House; yeas, 71; nays, 22.
                         
                         
                              SUPERVISORS' SETTLEMENTS.
                              Mr. Kilpatrick's bill [ H. R. 69 ] in relation to the
                                   settlement of Supervisors with Township Trustees, defining the
                                   time of settlement annually on the first Saturday in October, was
                                   considered and finally passed the House; yeas, 86; nays, 3.
                         
                         
                              TWENTY-NINTH (CRIMINAL) JUDICIAL CIRCUIT FOR
                                   JEFFERSON COUNTY.
                              Mr. Branham's bill [H. R. 72] in relation to criminal
                                   circuit courts, and creating the twenty-ninth criminal circuit
                                   (for the county of Jefferson), providing for the election of
                                   judge, the transfer of actions, etc., was considered on the third
                                   reading.
                              Mr, MILLER would like an explanation: the criminal court there has
                                   been lately abolished.
                              Mr.BRANHAM said he introduced that bill at the solicitation of
                                   prominent citizens of Madison. It is true, there was a criminal
                                   court there, and it was at the last session abolished.
                              Mr. BAKER, having been requested by sundry citizens of Jefferson
                                   county to oppose the bill, stated that some years ago there was a
                                   criminal court in that county, and that, by petition of
                                   two-thirds of its citizens, that court was abolished. When he was
                                   at home he was asked by those people to have the consideration of
                                   the bill deferred till he might be furnished with a remonstrance
                                   against it. I simply ask for this, not feeling sufficiently
                                   interested in the matter to ask for its indefinite
                                   postponement.
                              Mr. BRANHAM had also been in communication with those persons in
                                   Jefferson county who are opposed to this bill, and it was agreed
                                   between us that it might be best to let the bill pass the House
                                   to save time, and their remonstrance could be sent to the
                                   Senate.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley. This bill, only of interest to the citizens
                                   of Jefferson county, was before the committee, with all the facts
                                   connected with its necessity or desirability. He had seen many
                                   residents of Jefferson county recently, and their expression of
                                   opinion has been almost unanimous in favor of the bill. Jefferson
                                   county is populous and Madison is a city, and they have a large
                                   amount of criminal business.
                              The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas 54,
                                   nays 25.
                         
                         
                         
                              TOWN SURVEYS AND MAPS.
                              Mr. Canthorn's bill [H. R. 95] to authorize cities and
                                   towns to make and authorize surveys and plats, was considered on
                                   the third reading.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN said: It has appeared at a recent session of the city
                                   council of Vincennes, that the existing plat of that city is
                                   entirely illegal. He understood that the town of Sullivan, and
                                   other towns in the State, were in a similar situation as to their
                                   surveys and plats, and there is no law authorizing such maps and
                                   plattings.
                              The bill was finally passed the House--yeas 87, nays 1.
                         
                         
                              JUSTICES JURISDICTION.
                              Mr. WILSON of Ripley's bill [ H. R. 26] to so amend the
                                   ninth section of the justices act of June 9. 1852, as to make his
                                   jurisdiction co-extensive with the county, but that actions shall
                                   be brought in townships where defendants reside, or where the
                                   debt was contracted or the contract made, which failed on
                                   Saturday for want of a constitutional majority, was now finally
                                   passed--yeas 53, nays 38.
                         
                         
                              ADJOURNMENT OVER THANKSGIVING.
                              Mr. Cauthorn's concurrent resolution for adjournment over
                                   Thanksgiving day, from Wednesday to Monday, December 2, coming
                                   from the Senate with an amendment striking out
                                   "House," and inserting in lieu, "the
                                   two houses of the General Assembly"--
                              Mr. BRANHAM moved to suspend the order of business and take it
                                   up.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN thought the Senate was growing technical. The law
                                   provided that each House must meet on its own adjournment. This
                                   was a concurrent resolution for the adjournment of the General
                                   Assembly, and he doubted if the power existed te provide for such
                                   adjournment. The constitution gives the power to each House to
                                   meet on its own adjournment. The proper plan would have been for
                                   the Senate to agree to the House resolution and pass a similar
                                   one asking consent of the House to their adjournment in case they
                                   wished to adjourn.
                              The question being on concurring in the Senate amendment, it was
                                   rejected.
                              The SPEAKER stated that the action of the Senate was according to
                                   precedent. Thereupon Mr. Cauthom said he would yield his
                                   objection.
                              Then, without reconsidering the vote rejecting the amendment of the
                                   Senate, the question was again put on concurrence; and the Senate
                                   amendment was concurred in.
                              On motion of Mr. BUTTERWORTH, Mr. Wilson of Ripley's per
                                   diem and mileage amendment bill [H. R. 73] was postponed, and
                                   made the special order for Tuesday next at two o'clock
                                   p. m.
                              Mr. King's bill [H. R. 99] to authorize cities and towns
                                   of 10,000 inhabitants and over to make loans and issue bonds, was
                                   taken up on the third reading.
                              Mr. KING said because the bill authorized the loans to the extent
                                   oi 10 per cent. on the taxable property--a per cent, thought by
                                   some too large--he would ask unanimous consent that it be agian
                                   referred the committee for further consideration. And it was so
                                   ordered.
                         
                         
                              PROTECTION OF SHEEP.
                              Mr. Odle's bill [H. R 50] to amend the dog law so as not
                                   to conflict with the act of 1852 for the protection of sheep, was
                                   taken up on the final reading.
                              Mr. FURNAS said that in case there is not money enough in the fund
                                   to indemnify all the sheep losers, the act provides that it shall
                                   be divided pro rata amongst the losers.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY said he was instructed to support a measure of this
                                   kind. It was but an act of simple justice to the owners of sheep
                                   killed by dogs.
                              Mr. GIFFORD said under the present law the first comers amongst the
                                   losers get all the fund, and the rest get none.
                              The bill was finally passed the House--yeas, 85; nays, 5.
                         
                         
                              CITY IMPROVEMENTS.
                              Mr. Branham's bill [H. R. 71] to amend section 60 of the
                                   general corporation act of March 14, 1867, coming up in order on
                                   the third reading--
                              Mr. WALKER: It simply amends section 60, adding two or three lines,
                                   giving the cities authority, in the same way that they give aid
                                   to railroads and macadamized roadways, to give aid to other
                                   public improvements, upon petition of a majority of
                                   freeholders.
                              The vote on the final passage was reported--yeas, 46; nays, 41; so
                                   the bill failed, for lack of the constitutional majority of
                                   51.
                         
                         
                              REMOVAL OF COUNTY SEATS.
                              Mr. Walker's bill [H. R.81] amending the act providing for
                                   relocation of the county seats and the construction of buildings,
                                   by providing for immediate removal, and extending the time for
                                   construction of new buildings, was taken up on the third
                                   reading.
                              
                              Mr. WALKER : The bill provides for amendment of the present act in
                                   two intances. It in no wise facilitates or permits the removal of
                                   county seats. The proposed bill begins when the removal is
                                   virtually effected. As the law now stands, when the removal is
                                   ordered, the new Court House is to be built in one year. It must
                                   occur to gentlemen that in our counties, which are generally
                                   large, no good Court House can be built in the time with any view
                                   to economy. It is known that in this city it has required a
                                   year's time to lay the foundation of a Court House. And
                                   as the law now stands, the courts can not be held in the new site
                                   till the buildings are erected. This bill provides that after the
                                   contracts have been complied with, the courts may open there,
                                   providing the petitioners shall furnish the buildingr at their
                                   own expense.
                              Mr. GIFFORD suggested that the bill does not limit the cost of the
                                   Court House.
                              Mr. LENFESTEY. Does the bill legalize any act for the removal of
                                   county seats?
                              Mr. WALKER. It does not in any particular refer to past legislative
                                   action.
                              Mr. LENFESTEY would like to have the approval of the friends of the
                                   bill of a motion to recommit the bill to the Committee
                                        on County and Township Business.
                              Mr. WALKER stated that the friends of the bill had been desirous,
                                   and were still, of a full and fair understanding of the matter,
                                   and it had received this consideration at the hands of the
                                   committee which had reported on it favorably. He believed the
                                   House was now ready to vote upon it.
                              Mr. OFFUTT spoke in favor of the passage of the bill.
                              And then the bill finally passed; yeas, 70; nays, 22.
                         
                         
                              PUBLIC GROUNDS.
                              Mr. RUMSEY'S bill [H. R. 90] touching public squares and
                                   grounds not specifically dedicated, coming up was rejected on the
                                   final reading; yeas 34; nays, 49.
                         
                         
                              ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATOR.
                              Mr. FURNAS called for the special order--the election of United
                                   States Senator--and after a call of the House--The Speaker: In
                                   pursuance of Act of Congress, the House will now proceed to vote
                                   in the election of a United States Senator for the State of
                                   Indiana, to succeed the Hon. O. P. Morton, whose term of service
                                   expires on the 4th of March next. Nominations are in order.
                              Mr. THAYER placed in nomination the Hon. O. P. Morton, present
                                   incumbent, in these words: "I will put in nomination as
                                   the man most eminently qualified to succeed the present able,
                                   efficient and distinguished incumbent in the United States
                                   Senate, whose time expires on the 4th of March, 1873, the Hon. O.
                                   P. Morton."
                              Mr. WOOLLEN nominated the Hon. James D. Williams, of Knox
                                   county.
                              There being no other nominations, the vote proceeded, and the
                                   Speaker reported the result: Whole number of votes cast, 95; O.
                                   P. Morton received 54 votes; J. D. Williams received 41 votes--as

                              So the SPEAKER announced the result: Mr. Morton has received a
                                   majority of all the votes cast on the part of the House of
                                   Representatives.
                              A message was received from the Senate, announcing the passage of a
                                   concurrent resolution for a joint convention of the two houses at
                                   twelve m. on Wednesday for the purpose of comparing the vote for
                                   Senator.
                              The order of business was suspended, the concurrent resolution
                                   taken up and passed, and then, on motion the House took a recess
                                   till two o'clock p. m.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The SPEAKER called the House to order at two o'clock, and
                                   resumed the order of business.
                         
                         
                              DEFICIENCY APPROPRIATIONS.
                              Mr. Johnson's bill [H. R. 98] making appropriations of
                                   $4,000 to the State Normal school, $1,199 11 to pay cost of
                                   repairs on Supreme Court buildings, $7,000 to pay debt contracted
                                   by the Southern prison, and $26,381 62 to the House of Refuge,
                                   and $4,000 for current expenses, was finally passed the
                                   House--yeas 85, nays 1.
                         
                         
                              EXEMPTION LAWS AMENDMENT.
                              Mr. Shirley's exemption amendment bill [H. R. 5] raising
                                   the exemption to five hundred dollars, was taken up on the second reading thereof,
                                   with the unfavorable report of the majority of the
                                        Committee on the Judiciary, and the
                                   favorable report of the minority.
                              The SPEAKER. Under the rules of the House, the minority report must
                                   be considered as an amendment to the majority report. The
                                   question is on the adoption of the report of the minority.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY had presented this bill in view of the Constitutional
                                   provision, "that the privileges of the debtor shall be
                                   recognized by wholesome laws," etc. In 1852, under the
                                   present Constitution, the people of Indiana thought $300 was a
                                   proper exemption. But we all know now that the prices of living
                                   have so increased since that time that $500 to-day would riot
                                   place the debtor in a position to protect his family so well as
                                   $300 would twenty years ago. Whlist he was by no means in favor
                                   of legislation to enable the debtor to avoid the payment of his
                                   debts, he was prepared to say that the present law does not give
                                   him enough. A man ought to have something more than his household
                                   goods--a horse, a team; and the mechanic should have his tools;
                                   and if we design to carry out this Constitutional provision (as
                                   he believed) we ought to raise the exemption to $500.
                              Mr. PEED did not think exemption laws were for the purpose of
                                   enabling the debtor to go on with his business, but rather for
                                   the protection of his family. If the object were to enable the
                                   man to do business, we ought to exempt much more than we do. But
                                   in his experience the $300 has been sufficient for the object of
                                   the law, and he saw no occasion now for raising it.
                              Mr. THAYER thought the bill a good one, and concurred fully in the
                                   remarks of of the gentleman from Johnson and Morgan (Mr.
                                   Shirley).
                              Mr. JOHNSON would be in favor of raising the exemption to $500,
                                   provided it can be so shaped and guarded that it cannot be used
                                   as a cloak for fraud, but only for the protection of the
                                   debtor's family. There are cases in the practice of
                                   every attorney that would illustrate this--would demonstrate
                                   that, whilst the exemption laws will, and in many cases do,
                                   protect the debtor from utter ruin and his family from want, yet,
                                   in a large majority of cases, they work injury and fraud on the
                                   creditor. I have in my mind now several instances where a man is
                                   protected by the law from his creditors, and he lives in the
                                   enjoyment of all the comforts of life through the possessions of
                                   his wife--possessions to the extent of twenty to twenty-five
                                   thousand dollars' worth of property. The man thus
                                   protected is virtually in a lucrative business, accumulating
                                   property in his wife's name. My idea is that this bill
                                   should provide for the exemption of $500 either in his own name
                                   and right, or in the name and right of his wife, or jointly in
                                   the right of both. If the family is protected the object of the
                                   law is gained. If the family is thoroughly protected by the wife
                                   having a competency in her own right, that is the object of the
                                   law, and it is so understood in all the States where an exemption
                                   law is in force. Here is justice to the debtor as well as to the
                                   creditor. It is wrong to protect the debtor by a law that will
                                   unjustly injure the creditor. Then, if it is order to propose an
                                   amendment, let the bill read in this way: "Exempt $500
                                   owned or possessed by any resident householder, either owned by
                                   himself or by his wife, or by himself and wife jointly."
                                   If this were in the bill I should vote against the majority
                                   report.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY. The effect of the gentleman's amendment would
                                   be to say that the wife shall support the husband. It would be a
                                   slur on men to say that wives shall be supporters of their
                                   husbands, instead of husbands supporters of their wives. This
                                   provision of law must apply solely to the debtor--to no other
                                   person. Such a provision would violate the Constitution--strike
                                   down the whole thing. It would be unjust to say, because the wife
                                   has property, the husband shall not have the benefit of this law.
                                   The gentleman ought to remember that under our laws the realty of
                                   the wife belongs absolutely to her. You can't take the
                                   wife's property for her own debts. I say it would be not
                                   only unjust, but a reflection upon the intelligence of
                                   mankind.
                              Mr. JOHNSON. I did not suggest that any part of the wife's
                                   property should be taken to pay the husband's debts. My
                                   suggestion was to the Constitutional provision that there should
                                   be the necessary competency for a living. Now take the man who in
                                   his own right does not dare to say he owns anything, but whose
                                   wife has a competency, in nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out
                                   of a thousand you will find that such a debtor lives in the
                                   regular enjoyment of all the comforts of life. You will find him
                                   enjoying his wife's property precisely as his own;
                                   therefore he is fully protected in the enjoyment of all the
                                   comforts of life. I do not say that her property should be taken
                                   for his debts, but so long as he has a competency so long the
                                   creditor shall have the right to take, not his wife's property,
                                   but his own; but protect him in $500, which shall be owned and
                                   possessed either by himself or by himself and his wife
                                   together.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. I suppose, as I made the report, I ought to say
                                   something in defense of the action of the majority of the
                                   committee, and the best thing I can say is that it was the desire
                                   of the committee to let things stand as they are, unless they can
                                   see good reason for a change. The bill of the gentleman from
                                   Morgan and Johnson (Mr. Shirley) is just like any other scheme of
                                   benevolence. It was thought by the committee that it is against
                                   the Constitution. I think the exemption should be only in favor
                                   of the debtor, but the other question is the one I desire to
                                   impress upon the House. The $300 clause has stood for twenty
                                   years; and the raising of it from $300 to $500 is an innovation,
                                   and it might work more hardship than otherwise. To be sure it
                                   would be better for the debtor; but whether it would be more just
                                   is doubtful in my mind. The present exemption has operated
                                   fairly, so far as I know, all over the State. Better let it stand
                                   than begin a change of which we may not be able to see the
                                   end.
                              Mr. WOODARD had concurred with the minority of the committeewould
                                   be in favor of raising it to more than $500. I do not believe
                                   that all poor men are dishonest. I do not believe that any man
                                   can say that $300 is a reasonable amount for an exemption law,
                                   because it is not enough to enable a man to make a living. He
                                   must have either the implements of the farmer or the tools of
                                   themechanic. And when the debter takes these it is not right. In
                                   Illinois the exemption is a thousand dollars. In other States a
                                   larger amount.
                              Mr. MELLETT. I am in favor of the minority report. I concur in the
                                   remarks of the gentleman from Morgan (Mr. Shirley) and the
                                   gentleman from Parke (Mr. Woodard.) I would be willing to raise
                                   the amount, and then it would not be as large proportionately as
                                   it was when the present law was passed. Whilst every right-minded
                                   man with the gentleman from Marion (Mr. Johnson) can sympathize
                                   with the creditor when the debtor is covering up his property, I
                                   do not think his provision would relieve that. It is true that we
                                   see many debtors living in wealth and luxury, from whom no
                                   creditor can get a dollar. Rut what would be the effect of the
                                   gentleman's amendment? Those debtors, instead of owning
                                   $300, would suddenly be found stripped of every thing--even the
                                   gold-headed cane and things of that sort would be covered up by
                                   their wives names. If we could reach these cases of fraud, I
                                   might be in favor of such a provision; but thinking we
                                   can't, I shall vote for the minority report. One
                                   gentleman (Mr. Woollen) remarked that we have lived under the
                                   present law for twenty years and seen no hardship from its
                                   operation.That has been answered by the fact, that $500 now is
                                   not equal to $300 twenty years ago.
                              But I would ask the gentleman if he has ever had occasion to be
                                   present when the pittance of $300 has been set off to the debtor;
                                   and if so, let him cast his eyes back on that scene and answer
                                   the question whether it is sufficient for the support of that
                                   debtor's family.
                              Mr. WILSON of Ripley hoped the House would not concur in the mil
                                   crlty report. This question has been well considered by the
                                        Judiciary Committee, and it seemed to him
                                   that they are as competent as the House to determine the
                                   operation of this law. From his observation of its working for
                                   twenty years he was unable to say that it works hardships. He had
                                   never known a family to suffer because the exemption was
                                   inadequate. But where he had observed the hardship, it had been
                                   against the creditor. All debtors are not poor men, and all
                                   creditors are not rich men. Under this amendment the debtor would
                                   exempt $500 from the creditor not worth $50. Besides, when the
                                   creditor's property is before the appraisers the
                                   impulses of humanity are on his side, and they will exempt more
                                   than the fixed amount of exemption. This law is invoked ten times
                                   by the fallen and fraudulent debtor, where it is once invoked by
                                   the worthy poor debtor. I think the interests of the debtor and
                                   creditor classes are identical. We have numerous laws to prevent,
                                   to perplex and harass men in the collection of debts, insomuch
                                   that we have turned the laws of trade out of their natural
                                   channels. And if I was to say what the exemption should be I
                                   would be in favor of making it less than it is. I would go as far
                                   as any man to exempt the man who is actually worthy; but when we
                                   have protected one hundred unworthy for one that is worthy, I
                                   think we ought to pause.
                              Mr. MILLER. I think the conservative views expressed by the
                                   gentleman from Morgan and Johnson [Mr. Shirley] are the best. One
                                   gentleman thinks the amendment ought to be made lower, another
                                   that it ought to be increased, and others that the law ought to
                                   stand as it is. If I were to
                                   propose an exemption law, I would make it a little different from
                                   any proposition here. I would provide, in addition to the $300
                                   the debtor now has, that every man should have a reasonable
                                   amount exempted to be used in the trade by which he makes his
                                   living. But I do not desire to discuss the question. For the
                                   purpose mevely of testing the peculiar rules we have adopted, I
                                   will move to indefinitely postpone the report of the
                                   minority.
                              The SPEAKER. The motion to amend takes precedence of the motion to
                                   postpone.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN moved to lay the minority report on the table.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY demanded the yeas and nays; which being ordered and
                                   taken, the result was--yeas 59, nays 30--so the minority report
                                   was laid on the table.
                              Mr. KIMBALL moved to recommit the bill, with instructions to amend
                                   it by making the exemption $300, and the tools, etc., used in the
                                   trade or calling of the debtor, not to exceed $1,000 in
                                   value,
                              The SPEAKER. The question is on the motion to recommit with the
                                   instructions.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. I do that, because it will enable the family to live,
                                   while the debtor will have something wherewith to make a living.
                                   Such a provision would embrace and go down to every condition of
                                   life. Even the bachelor would have under it a strong inducement
                                   to marry. [Laughter.]
                              The motion was agreed to, and the bill was accordingly recommitted
                                   to the Committee on the Judiciary.
                         
                         
                              AMENDMENT OF THE RULES
                              The SPEAKER now directed the consideration of Mr.
                                   Kirkpatrick's resolution for amendment of the rules so
                                   as to require that all bills receiving a favorable committee
                                   report shall be printed.
                              Mr. BRANHAM hoped it would not be adopted. He might be in favor of
                                   such a notion to print all bills ordered to be engrossed, but the
                                   House could not know enough about a bill to order the printing
                                   because of a favorable report.
                              The resolution was rejected.
                              The resolution of Mr. CAUTHORN for the transfer of the
                                   State's claim against the Terre Haute and Indianapolis
                                   Railroad Company to certain educational institutions, was taken
                                   up when Mr. Cauthorn asked that it be passed over, and its
                                   consideration was passed over accordingly by unanimous
                                   consent.
                              Mr. FURNAS submitted a preamble and resolution for the use of the
                                   hall of the House of Representatives any day this week after
                                   to-morrow (Wednesday) for the Convention of Breeders of Short
                                   Horn Cattle, which is about to assemble in this city.
                              The resolution was adopted.
                         
                         
                              PURDUE UNIVERSITY.
                              The SPEAKER laid before the House a memorial, signed by the
                                   Trustees of Purdue's University, which was referred to
                                   the Committee on Education. [See
                                   Appendix.]
                              The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Auditor
                                   of State transmitting advance sheets of a portion of his
                                   forthcoming report, in compliance with a resolution of the House
                                   of the 25th inst.
                              Mr. LENFESTY, by unanimous consent introduced a bill [H. R. 130]
                                   for an act to render uniform the rate of interest on the common
                                   school fund of the State (8 per cent.)
                              The bill was referred to the Committee on
                                        Education.
                              Mr. KIMBALL, by consent, a bill [H. R. 131] for the prevention of
                                   cruelty to animals, and prescribing a peralty therefor.
                              It was referred to the Judiciary Committee.
                              Also, a bill [H. R. 132] defining wife whipping, and prescribing
                                   punishment therefor. [Any person beating or maltreating his wife
                                   is declared a wife whipper, and his punishment on conviction is
                                   fixed at a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars, and
                                   imprisonment in the penitentiary for not less than one, nor more
                                   than twenty-one years.]
                              It was refeered to the Committee Rights and
                                        Privileges.
                         
                         
                              REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                              Mr. RIGGS, from the Committee on Claims,
                                   presented a claim of the Journal Company for $22, and one of
                                   Johnston Bros. for $140, recommending that they be allowed. The
                                   former was allowed, and the latter withdrawn to be presented to
                                   the Senate, the debt having originated with a committee of that
                                   body.
                              The same committee presented the claim of the Journal Company for $1,481 05 for papers furnished
                                   members of the last General Assembly.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN moved to strike out the item for interest.
                                   Considerable discussion ensued, when Mr. Offut moved to amend by
                                   fixing the interest at six per cent., which amendment was
                                   accepted by Mr. Cauthorn.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN had no doubt the claimants justified the action of
                                   members of the last Legislature, which broke up the quorum and defeated the
                                   appropriation at that time for the payment of the bill, yet he
                                   favored the allowance of six per cent. interest
                              Mr. KIMBALL thought the good accomplished in the defense of the
                                   action alluded to was worth something. The Sentinel Company presented a similar claim for
                                   interest, and as they had abundantly abused the Legislature for
                                   that action they were not deserving of more, and he as a
                                   representative of the Journal Company was
                                   willing to fix the rate of interest at six per cent.
                              The motion to fix the interest at six per cent. prevailed, and the
                                   report, as amended, was concurred in, and referred to the
                                        Committee on Ways and Means, with
                                   instructions to incorporate it in the specific appropriation
                                   bill.
                              The committee reported a like bill from the Sentinel Company, which was similarly disposed of.
                              Mr. WALKER, from the Judiciary Committee,
                                   returned Mr. Isenhower's bill [H. R. 89] to amend
                                   sections forty-nine and eighty-seven of the act providing for the
                                   settlement of decedent's estates, recommending its
                                   indefinite postponement.
                              Mr. MILLER returned Mr. Baxter's bill [H. R. 93] to amend
                                   section sixteen of the act to enable persons whose wives are
                                   insane to convey real estate, recommending indefinite
                                   postponement.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN returned Mr. Wood's bill [H. R. 74] to amend
                                   section nine of the practice act of June 17, 1852, recommending
                                   its indefinite postponement; and these reports were severally
                                   concurred in.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY returned his bill [H. R. 30] to amend section 445 of
                                   the practice act of June, 1852, with amendment striking out
                                   second and third sections. [It provides that where property fails
                                   to sell under execution, on the first offer, it may be sold
                                   thereafter, by legal notice, for not less than one-half the
                                   valuation.]
                              The amendments were concurred in, and after explanation by Messrs.
                                   Woollen, Given, Shirley and Broadus, the bill was ordered to the
                                   engrossment.
                              Mr. OGDEN returned Mr. Cobb's bill [H. R. 91] to amend the
                                   act of 1852, concerning promissory notes, bills of exchange,
                                   etc., and the act of March 11, 1861, recommending indefinite
                                   postponement.
                              It was concurred in.
                              Mr. Johnson, from the same committee, reported back House bill No.
                                   35, to amend the practice act--declaring who shall be competent
                                   witnesses, with an amendment to the first section, and a further
                                   amendment striking out the second section, and substituting a new
                                   bill instead.
                              The SPEAKER could not understand the report.
                              Mr. JOHNSON explained it, but the mystery was not cleared up.
                              A motion was made to adjourn, but withdrawn. Meanwhile the report
                                   of the Judiciary Committee was undisposed of,
                                   and was passed over in an informal way, the Speaker insisting
                                   that the committee should amend its report, and the Chairman
                                   remarking that the committee could not do it.
                              Mr. GREGORY, by unanimous consent, introduced a bill [H. R. 133] to
                                   repeal sections fifty-four and fifty-eight, and amending section
                                   forty-seven of the practice act, with regard to amendments in
                                   pleadings.
                              It was referred to the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary.
                              Mr. GREGORY, a bill [H. R. 134] to fix the time of holding courts
                                   in the Twelfth Judicial Circuit, (embracing the counties of
                                   White, Newton, Jasper, Benton and Tippecanoe.)
                              It was referred to a select committee interested.
                              Mr. Gronendyke, Mr. Winn and Mr. Jones, obtained leave of absence
                                   for tomorrow.
                              On motion of Mr. KING the Committee on Railroads
                                   was authorized to employ a clerk.
                         
                         
                              MEMORY OF THE HON. NORMAN EDDY.
                              Mr. HENDERSON, from the special committee to whom was referred so
                                   much of the Governor's Message as refers to the memory
                                   of the Hon. Norman Eddy, submitted a report rehearsing the
                                   leading facts and events of the public life of Col. Eddy, and the
                                   estimation in which his memory is held by the House and the
                                   country, and recommending the adoption of the following ;
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, That we have learned
                                                  with profound regret of the death of Colonel
                                                  Norman Eddy, and feel that the State in his death
                                                  has lost a valuable and worthy citizen.
                                             RESOLVED, That the House
                                                  specially commends the noble action of his
                                                  Excellency, Governor Baker, in filling the vacancy
                                                  in the office of Secretary of State caused by his
                                                  death, and hope the precedent will never be
                                                  departed from in future by any one having the
                                                  power of appointment in like cases.
                                             RESOLVED, That appreciating the
                                                  ability and eminent public services rendered the
                                                  country in council and in the field by the
                                                  decedent we commend his widow and children to the
                                                  sympathy and tender regard of his fellow citizens
                                                  without regard to party predilections.
                                             RESOLVED, That a copy of the
                                                  above resolutions be forwarded to the family of
                                                  the decedent by the Clerk of this House.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              The report of the committee was concurred in, and the resolutions
                                   were adopted by a rising vote.
                              The House then adjourned.
                         
                         
                    
                    
                    
                         THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                         
                         THIRTEENTH VOLUME.
                         
                         INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
                         
                         IN SENATE.
                         
                              WEDNESDAY, November 27, 1872.
                         
                         The Senate met pursuant to adjournment, President Friedley in the
                              chair.
                         The Rev. S. S. Hunting, pastor of Unity Church, opened the session with
                              prayer.
                         On motion the reading of the Secretary's minutes were dispensed
                              with.
                         
                              BASTARDY.
                              On motion of Mr. BROWN the order of business was dispensed with,
                                   and he returned from the Judiciary Committee
                                   the bill [S. 36] to regulate proceedings in bastardy with a
                                   substitute therefor, viz: a bill to amend sections 15 and 17 of
                                   the act of May 16, 1852, regulating prosecutions in cases of
                                   bastardy and providing for the support of illegitimate children,
                                   so that the testimony of the prosecuting witness may be
                                   perpetuated, and the prosecution may be commenced before a
                                   justice of the peace; and requiring the court to demand security
                                   for the proper expenditure of the money for the support of the
                                   child; that the suit may be dismissed by the prosecuting witness,
                                   when provision has been made by the reputed father for the
                                   maintenance and education of the child, the terms of provision to
                                   be filed with the records of the court; and where the prosecuting
                                   witness is an unsuitable prrson to have the custody of the child
                                   and of the funds for its support, the court may appoint a
                                   suitable person who shall give security for the faithful
                                   performance of his duty.
                              Mr. NEFF hoped the Senate would refuse to concur in this report of
                                   the committee, for he desired to see this class of cases taken
                                   out of the hands of justices and planed in the Circuit and Common
                                   Pleas Courts, as his bill [S. 36] provides.
                              He hoped the amendment giving jurisdiction in these cases to
                                   Justices of the Peace would not be adopted. It rendered the
                                   prosecutions more expensive to the prosecuting witness, and was
                                   less satisfactory than where the prosecutions are commenced in
                                   the Circuit or Common Pleas court.
                              Mr. N. said that cases of this kind should always be commenced in
                                   courts of record. Every one who has had any experience in
                                   practicing before Justices knows that in a majority of cases the
                                   trials of such causes are but farces. He preferred the Senate
                                   should not adopt the report of the committee, but on the contrary
                                   perfect and adopt the original bill, changing the jurisdiction of
                                   such cases from Justices' courts to courts of Common
                                   Pleas and Circuit Court. He believed the provisions to be just.
                                   When a member of the House of Representatives, in 1867, he
                                   offered a similar bill which passed the House but failed to pass
                                   the Senate. He really believed a law should be passed which would
                                   give bastard children some rights. Legal gentlemen know how often
                                   putative fathers take advantage of the mother by giving her what
                                   they call satisfaction, but which is really no satisfaction, and
                                   thus the ends of justice are defeated. The object of the law is
                                   to secure a support and the
                                   means of education for the child. He never knew of a settlement
                                   in such a case but what the object of the law has been defeated.
                                   Generally these men are shrewd men whotake advantage of the
                                   mother and get her to come into court and say that proper
                                   allowance has been given her and that satisfaction has been made,
                                   when such is not the case. He thought these casesshould be taken
                                   out of Justices' courts and given into more competent
                                   hands to try.
                              The report of the committee was concurred in.
                         
                         
                              REPORTS FROM THE JUDICIARY
                                        COMMITTEE.
                              Mr. BROWN, from the Judiciary Committee,
                                   returned the bill [H. R. 22] to amend the first section of the
                                   act of March 4, 1865, for the completion of the unfinished
                                   business of any General Assembly by the succeeding session of the
                                   same General Assembly, with a report recommending its
                                   passage.
                              It was concurred in.
                              Mr. BROWN also returned a bill [S. 28] on the same subject,
                                   recommending it be on the table.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              He also returned from the same committee the bill [S. 16]
                                   authorizing suits to be brought in partnership name only in
                                   certain cases, with a substitute therefor, entitled "An
                                   act authorizing suits to be brought in the partnership name, and
                                   repealing all conflicting laws," providing that where a
                                   partner has failed to contribute to the capital the amount due by
                                   him to carry on the business, and there shall be outstanding
                                   debts against the pertnership, it shall be lawful for any other
                                   partner who has contributed his full quota to sue the delinquent
                                   in the name of the partnership, the amount recovered to be paid
                                   for the benefit of the partnership.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              He also returned the bill [S. 20], from the same committee,
                                   relating to the sale of real estate on execution owned by husband
                                   and wife, with a report that it lay on the table.
                              It was concurred in.
                              He also returned from the same committee Mr. Neff s bill [S. 19] to
                                   amend the divorce law, recommending that the bill be laid on the
                                   table.
                              It was concurred in.
                         
                         
                              THANKSGIVING RECESS.
                              Mr. BROWN said that inasmuch as it is understood that the Senate
                                   will adjourn from a little after noon to-day till Monday, he
                                   moved to suspend the regular order of business that bills on the
                                   second reading may be read and referred to appropriate
                                   committees. He withheld his motion for--
                         
                         
                              ADDITIONAL PAY WANTED.
                              Mr. THOMPSON, who presented a communication from the Adjutant
                                   General of the State, netting forth the duties of the office, and
                                   praying for increased compensation--$3,300 in addition to what he
                                   has already received.
                              It was referred to the Committee on Claims.
                         
                         
                              BOUNDARY LINES.
                              Mr. BOWMAN, from the select committee thereon, returned the bill
                                   [S. 50] to define more correctly the boundary line between Clark
                                   and Washington counties, with a recommendation that it be
                                   passed.
                              It was concurred in.
                              Mr. BROWN renewed his motion to take up bills on the second
                                   reading.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                         
                         
                              WORK FOR COMMITTEES.
                              The following described bills were read by title and referred to
                                   appropriate committees:
                              Mr. SMITH'S bill [S. 83] denning the offense of libel and
                                   prescribing punishment therefor.
                              Mr. STROUD'S bill [S. 84] to protect citizens of Indiana
                                   from empyricism and to elevate the medical profession.
                              The bill [H. R. 7] providing that justices shall have exclusive
                                   jurisdiction in certain misdemeanors.
                              The bill [H. R. 27] concerning interest on judgments.
                              The bill [H. R. 32] to fix the terms of the Sixteenth Judicial
                                   District Court.
                         
                         
                              SCHOOL HOUSES.
                              Mr. RHODES, by leave, introduced a bill [S. 86] for an act to amend
                                   section one of the act authorizing cities and towns to issue
                                   bonds to build and complete school houses, and authorizing the
                                   levy of an additional tax for payment thereof, approved March 11,
                                   1867, which was read the first time and passed to the second
                                   reading.--[It authorizes cities and towns to negotiate a sale of
                                   bonds not exceeding $40,000 in the aggregate, to procure means to
                                   complete school buildings, etc.]
                         
                         
                              PLANK ROAD ASSESSMENT.
                              Mr. GLESSNER moved that the committee having in charge the bill [S.

                              CLAIMS COMMITTEE REPORT.
                              Mr. BEESON, from the Committee on Claims,
                                   returned the claim of George T. Carr for clerking at the last
                                   session, with a recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed,
                                   this clerk having received five dollars a day for each day of
                                   that session.
                              On motion by Mr. DITTEMORE, the report was laid on the table, in
                                   the absence of the Senator from Grant, who presented the
                                   claim.
                         
                         
                              BIRD AND SARNIGHAUSEN CONTEST.
                              Mr. NEFF, from the Committee on Claims, returned
                                   the claim of John Sarnighausen of $191 for expenses incurred in
                                   the contest of his seat last session.
                              Mr. BROWN moved to add a provision allowing the same amount to the
                                   contesteem Ochmig Bird.
                              Mr. NEFF said there was no claim filed by Senator Bird. The
                                   committee simply allowed the actual cash outlay to Senator
                                   Sarnighausen. If Mr. Bird's expenses were the same Mr.
                                   N. would not object.
                              Mr. BROWN knew Mr. Bird's expenses to be more than the sum
                                   named. He modified his motion, so that the report may be
                                   recommitted with instructions to include an appropriation in
                                   favor of Mr. Bird, which motion was agreed to.
                         
                         
                              PAY TO COMMITTEEMEN.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE offered a resolution that the Senate
                                        Committee on Military Affairs of 1871 be allowed
                                   thirty dollars each for expenses incurred in visiting the

                                        on Claims.

                                             WHEREAS, It has been a matter of

                                                  false and forged vouchers with the Auditor of
                                                  State, for the false and pretended purchase of
                                                  paper for the use of the State; that under such
                                                  "raised" false and fraudulent

                                                  of money, a portion only of which has been
                                                  reimbursed to the Treasury of the State; and,
                                                  whereas, the evidence of said frauds so
                                                  perpetrated upon the Treasury, will aid in a

                                                  legislation required to recover said sums of money
                                                  and effectually prohibit the repetition of such
                                                  offenses in the future; therefore, be it

                                   furnished the Senate.
                              They were referred to the Committee on

                              MARRIED WOMEN.
                              Mr. NEFF moved to suspend the order of business and take from the
                                   table the report of the Judiciary Committee,
                                   on the bill [S. 26] to amend section 18 of the act regulating
                                   descents and the apportionment of estates, approved May 14,
                                   1852.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. NEFF moved to amend the report by changing the recommendation
                                   from that of indefinite postponement to a recommendation that the
                                   bill be put upon its passage. He believed it was time to change
                                   the old idea that married women can do nothing; that she is so
                                   swallowed up in marriage that she can do no legal act in herself. He said the
                                   amendment provided that a widow holding real estate who should
                                   marry a second or subsequent time, may alienate her estate with
                                   the assent of her husband, and the proceeds shall be her separate
                                   property. The present statute he conceived to be wrong, and the
                                   amendment would do nothing but justice. Widows thus situated, who
                                   marry again, sometimes own unimproved real estate, from which
                                   they derive no income, but on which they have to pay taxes, and
                                   which thus becomes a burden to them. And yetunder the present
                                   law, they can not rid themselves of the burden, even with the
                                   consent of their husbands. He thought it simple justice to allow
                                   a woman to sell her property, sue for the purchase money,
                                   reinvest it, and exercise all the rights to which she would be
                                   entitled as an unmarried woman. He believed it was time to permit
                                   women to act for themselves, and that we should educate them to
                                   do business and be independent.
                              Mr. GLESSNER [Mr. Hubbard in the chair] said the bill was
                                   considered by the Judiciary Committee, but one
                                   member of which committee was now in the Chamber. Many seats are
                                   now vacant with the understanding that no business was to be done
                                   this afternoon, and yet there has been brought up one of the most
                                   important bills of the session. He moved to lay the motion to
                                   amend on the table.
                              The motion was agreed to.

                              Mr. WADGE offered a resolution instructing the Doorkeeper to
                                   furnish the employes daily a copy of the daily Journal and Sentinel.
                              It was adopted.
                              And then the Senate adjourned till Monday, at two
                                   o'clock.

                                   at this institution, and nine professors in the literary
                                   department, and the halls are crowded so that it is impossible to
                                   do the students justice; and unless provision be made for their
                                   accommodation--to supply its growing wants--the university,
                                   instead of going forward, must retrograde. If this bill pass, a
                                   portion of the fund appropriated will be devoted to the support
                                   of the State Medical College, which is located in this city, and
                                   which has been incorporated with the State University; but so far
                                   no provision has been made to pay the professors, they having to
                                   seek support from students and from other sources. This is
                                   unbecoming in the great State of Indiana. The State of Michigan
                                   has a University which does her the greatest credit; and there is
                                   no reason why Indiana should be behind this much younger State of
                                   Michigan. We should feel a just public pride in keeping pace with
                                   other neighboring States, and there is no better way in which we
                                   can show it than by fostering the educational institutions of the
                                   State. If we do not so, the consequence will be to send our young
                                   men to the State of Michigan for education; and to give that
                                   State a prominence which I do not like to encourage.
                              I think the proposed appropriation will place the State University
                                   in such a condition that she will be on the road towards the
                                   purposes for which she was designed, and beyond the reach of
                                   fatal accidents. I will submit a brief statement of the condition
                                   of Indiana University, and what this bill proposes to make it. It
                                   will engage nine professors in the literary departmerit, at a
                                   salary of $2,000 each, and $2,500 for the President. This only
                                   adds one professor. There will be the President, and the chairs
                                   of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Greek, Latin, Pure Mathematics,
                                   Applied Mathematics and English and Modern Languages and
                                   Literature. The professorship this bill adds is from the division
                                   of the class in chemistry into classes in chemistry and geology.
                                   It has been found necessary to divide that class, there being
                                   over sixty students in it. The bill increases the salary of the
                                   professors, now restricted to $1,000, and unless their salary is
                                   increased the University will lose them. No professor can be kept
                                   in an institution of this kind for less than $2,000; for they are
                                   men, or should be men of the best talent and the highest order of
                                   literary attainments which the country can afford. There are now
                                   two professors in the law department, and the trustees propose to
                                   give these a salary of $2,500. In reply to a question by Mr.
                                   Woollen, he stated that the institution has for present resources
                                   the revenue from the endowment fund of $7,000 per annum; and
                                   there is an existing statute granting the University $8,000 per
                                   annum. The appropriation proposed in this bill would make the
                                   total resources of the institution $35,000 a year. Out of this it
                                   is proposed to set apart $7,500 for the support of the medical
                                   department--its incidental expenses. So far as these statistics
                                   are concerned, he very much regretted than we have not yet the
                                   catalogue of the University containing the report of the
                                   trustees, which would give the House all necessary information on
                                   the subject.
                              Mr. MILLER, Considering that we have a very scant House, I move to
                                   postpone the further consideration of this bill till Monday at
                                   half-past two o'clock.
                              Mr. BRANHAM hoped that the special order would not be made. He
                                   supposed that no member of the House is aware of the amount of
                                   appropriations which the various institutions of the State are
                                   asking for. Whether they are asking for more than they ought to
                                   have he did not pretend to say; but one thing he was very certain
                                   of, that they are asking for much more than there is now, or will
                                   be, in the State treasury. It might be good policy in the first
                                   place to see what amount of funds we have, and then make the
                                   appropriations. We ought to cut our garments according to the
                                   cloth. He would be glad to see the University well cared for; but
                                   this is not all they ask for, and are not the plans of the University
                                   improvements based upon the supposition that the State will aid
                                   them? He was about to move to lay the subject on the table--not
                                   from any hostile disposition toward the institution, but from a
                                   desire, if we can not give them all they want to give them a
                                   part. But then he wanted the bill to state distinctly when these
                                   funds shall be drawn from the treasury. He did not want to
                                   commence by giving so large an amount to one institution as to
                                   preclude the giving of any thing to the rest. He moved that the
                                   bill be laid upon the table for the present, so that it may be
                                   called up at the proper time.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY, a bill [H. R. 146] to prohibit the destruction of
                                   ditches, drains and running streams of water, and provide a
                                   penalty for the violation of this act.
                         
                         
                              OHIO AND WABASH RIVERS.
                              On motion of Mr. GIVEN, the joint resolution from the Senate in
                                   relation to the improvement of the Ohio and Wabash rivers was
                                   taken up; and thereupon arose some debate by Messrs. Furnas,
                                   Given, Branham and Schmuck, hesitating about the sweeping
                                   language of the joint resolution, which might include expensive
                                   works on these rivers and their tributaries.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. If I am not mistaken a corps of engineers have already
                                   reported the practicability of the improvement of the Wabash
                                   River at a moderate cost, and they are now at work upon it.
                              Mr. THAYER. It seems from the reading that the object is to make
                                   the Ohio and Wabash improvements sufficient to carry all the
                                   boats at this time navigating them.
                              Mr. GIVEN. It is only recommendatory: I think there is nothing
                                   wrong in the wording of the resolution. I will call for the
                                   reading of it again--without the preamble.
                              It was again read by the Clerk.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. The language is rather too indefinite. To say
                                   "all boats on the river" is a little out of the
                                   question : and if you strike out "the
                                   tributaries," it would still be asking rather too much.
                                   I amdecidedly in favor of the resolution, and I believe every
                                   member of the House will vote for it if properly worded. The
                                   engineers think it is entirely practicable to make the Ohio
                                   navigable for vessels drawing from five to seven feet--and the
                                   Wabash too: but to ask to make these rivers navigable for all
                                   boats requiring ten to twelve feet of water is asking entirely
                                   too much.
                              Mr. GIVEN. It seems to me that there is no indefiniteness in the
                                   language there. It does not apply to any but such streams as are
                                   used for navigation. The object is to make navigation practicable
                                   wherever boats are used.
                              Mr. SCHMUCK. Several days ago I introduced a resolution for this
                                   same purpose. I think, perhaps, that would be more acceptable to
                                   the House, and would like to have it read.
                              On motion of Mr. KING, the joint resolution was referred to the
                                        Committee on Manufactures and
                                   Commerce.
                              On motion of Mr. CAUTHORN, tho joint resolution with reference to
                                   the same matter, introduced the other day by Mr. Schmuck, was
                                   recalled from the Committee on Federal
                                        Relations, and referred to the same committee with
                                   the Senate proposition.
                              Mr. FURNAS submitted a resolution that the Committee on
                                        Temperance be instructed to prepare and report a
                                   bill to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquor in any city,
                                   town or township, unless the majority of the voters shall
                                   petition therefor.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN moved that it be referred to the Committee of
                                        the whole House, and made the special order for
                                   Friday at ten o'clock.
                              Mr. KIMBALL moved to refer it to the Committee on
                                        Reformatory Institutions.
                              Mr. RUMSEY proposed to amend the resolution by inserting
                                   "requested" instead of
                                   "instructed."
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. GIFFORD moved (ineffectually) to refer the resolution to the
                                        Committee on Swamp Lands. [Laughter.]
                              Mr. Cauthorn's motion was rejected; and then the
                                   resolution was rejected.
                              On motion of Mr. BAKER the House took a recess of twenty
                                   minutes.
                         
                         
                              LEGISLATIVE ETIQUETTE.
                              When the house was called to order, Mr. CAUTHORN moved that, in
                                   order to receive the Senate with the courtesy due from one body
                                   of this Legislature to the other, the seats on the right of the
                                   hall be vacated for their use, and that a committee of two be
                                   appointed to wait upon the Senate, inform that body that the
                                   House, in pursuance of the concurrent resolution, is ready to
                                   meet it in joint convention, and to escort it to the hall of the
                                   House.
                              The motion was agreed to, and the Speaker appointed Messrs.
                                   Cauthorn and Kimball a committee to wait upon the Senate.
                         
                         
                              JOINT CONVENTIONSENATOR MORTON'S
                                   ELECTION.
                              The SPEAKER, just before 12 o'clock M., directed the preparation of the
                                   hall for the reception and seating of the Senate on the right,
                                   and at the specified time the officers and members of the Senate
                                   appeared and were seated on the right, the President of the
                                   Senate presiding on the right of the Speaker.
                              The PRESIDENT of the Senate--Gentlemen of the Senate and House of
                                   Representatives, we have met in joint convention in pursuance of
                                   a joint resolution of the two houses of the General Assembly, and
                                   in obedience to the statute of the United States, to compare and
                                   count the vote cast yesterday for United States Senator. The
                                   Secretary of the Senate will now read so much of the Senate

                              The PRESIDENT of the Senate. It occurs to the Chair that the

                                   said: "Gentlemen of the Legislature, I came not here
                                   this morning to inflict a speech upon you, but simply to express
                                   my sincere acknowledgments for this great mark of your
                                   confidence; and that I shall have no motive but to do my duty to
                                   the nation and the State, I hope so to perform my duties that no
                                   man who voted for me yesterday will have cause to blush for
                                   having done so. I therefore express to you again my sincere
                                   thanks and take my leave."

                              It was referred to the Judiciary Committee.
                              Mr. KING introduced a bill [H. R. 154] for an act to amend the act

                                   which on account of ill health, he would be excused from
                                   describing.
                              They were referred (under the rules) to the Committee on

                              By Mr. WINTERBOTHAM. On the same subject.
                         
                         
                              REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                              Mr. BROWN, from the Judiclary Committee submitted a report,
                                   returning the joint resolution [H. R. --] agreeing to the
                                   amendment proposed by the last General Assembly concerning the
                                   debt chargeable upon the Wabash and Erie Canal, with a favorable
                                   recommendation thereon.
                              Mr. BROWN returned from the Judiciary Committee
                                   the bill [H. R. 27] concerning interest on judgments, with an
                                   amendment to the title by striking out the words "a
                                   bill," and inserting in lieu thereof the words
                                   "an act," and when so amended recommending its
                                   passage.
                              He also returned from the same committee the bill [H. R. 7]
                                   providing that Justices shall have original jurisdiction in
                                   certain cases of misdemeanors where the penalty does not exceed a
                                   fine of $25, with amendments clerical only.
                              Also, from the same committee, the bill [S. 71] to amend sections 7
                                   and 49, of the settlement of decedents estates act of June 5,
                                   1S52, with a favorable report, and with amendments providing that
                                   letters of administration may be taken out within five days and a
                                   sale may take place upon twelve days notice.
                              Also, the bill [S. 72] to amend section 127 of the general practice
                                   act, with a favorable recommendation.
                              He also returned from the same committee the bill [S. 76] to define
                                   the crime of libel, with a similar report.
                              Also, the bill [S. 75] defining the law and fixing punishment for
                                   verbal slander, with a like recommendation.
                              He also returned the libel bill [S. 73], with a recommendation that
                                   it lay on the table.
                              These reports were severally concurred in.
                         
                         
                              PROPERTY RIGHTS OF MARRIED WOMEN.
                              He also returned a resolution from the same committee, concerning
                                   the rights of married women, recommending that it lie on the
                                   table. [The resolution was one of inquiry as to the expediency of
                                   passing a law extending to married women the same rights as to holding property and
                                   making contracts that are enjoyed by unmarried women.]
                              Mr. HUBBARD said that in the course of his practice, his attention
                                   had often been called to the condition of our laws on this
                                   subject. Under the old English law, when a man married a woman he
                                   took her property and her debts, substantially. He was liable for
                                   all contracts made by her, necessary for persons in their
                                   condition in life. But we have changed all that. We give a
                                   married woman the right to hold any property that a man can hold,
                                   or she could hold when she was single, and we have not made her
                                   liable for general indebtedness. The consequence is, it is
                                   rendered possible for a woman to make contracts in her own name,
                                   and not be liable generally on a single one of those contracts.
                                   There is, as Senators are aware, but a small cla s of contracts
                                   on which a married woman can be held liable--where it is directly
                                   for the benefit of her separate property--her real estate. Then,
                                   with all the rights of property that a man has, she is not liable
                                   for any indebtedness whatever. That is the condition of the
                                   laws.
                              A large amount of real estate and personal property is in the hands
                                   of married women, whose husbands are conducting the business
                                   generally, and yet the former are not responsible for a cent of
                                   indebtedness. The property is put into the wife's hands
                                   when the husband is unembarrassed, and when misfortune comes it
                                   is found, too late by the creditors, that they are not
                                   responsible, that the wives have for years held every cent of
                                   their property. In some other States, Michigan and New York, for
                                   instance, a married woman is made responsfble for her contracts
                                   the same as when single. It is commonly supposed by citizens of
                                   this State that when a creditor holds a note signed by a married
                                   woman, she holding the property, the note is good. But this is
                                   not the case. The note is no better than blank paper. The law
                                   ought to be changed so that liability shall follow the possession
                                   of property.
                              Mr. BROWN said the committee examined the bill and the propositions
                                   contained in it, and he thought came to a very wise and correct
                                   conclusion. He had about all the trouble he wanted to live with
                                   his wife under the present law, and if the proposition of the
                                   Senator over the way [Mr. Hubbard] should be adopted, he
                                   didn't know that he would be able to live with her at
                                   all. [Laughter.] If the Senator is in favor of subordinating
                                   mankind to womankind he did not know that he should object, but
                                   as long as the Senator shook the pantaloons at him he must allow
                                   him to put them on and wear them, It seemed to him that more
                                   family difficnlties occurred and more divorce suits were
                                   instituted because of the increasing change of the law by which
                                   women were invested with rights hitherto unknown to them. It
                                   brings about family quarrels and family trouble, and he, for one,
                                   was in favor of abridging rather than enlarging what are commonly
                                   known as the rights of married women.
                              The hardship of which the Senator speaks can be said in reference
                                   to any branch of the law. It is generally supposed that a man
                                   knows the law. If a man contracts with a married woman he is
                                   generally supposed to know what the law is in relation to that
                                   kind of contract. A woman can hold in her own right property that
                                   she acquires by devise or descent. But if she earns money by her
                                   own labor, that is her husband's. He is entitled to her
                                   wages and the proceeds of her wages. Therefore, he said, it was
                                   right that a woman should not be allowed to set up an independent
                                   business of her own. to carry it on by contracting, selling,
                                   trading and dickering, because the proceeds of all that kind of
                                   service which she may perform belong to her husband. He should
                                   have the supervision and control of it. If the law is changed as
                                   the Senator wants it changed, in his opinion it would bring about
                                   domestic discord and trouble.
                              Mr. HUBBARD said the object of the resolution was to protect the
                                   rights of the creditors of married women. Under the present law
                                   she has the same rights of holding property that a man has. The
                                   object of the bill is to prevent the creditors from being
                                   defrauded. So far as dissensions and discord in the family were
                                   concerned he thought the family relations were as harmonious now
                                   as they were a hundred years ago before the changes in the law
                                   respecting the rights of married women were made. According to
                                   the law of Indiana, if a married woman makes a contract with
                                   reference to her separate property, it must be for the benefit of
                                   that property, and if a court of equity thinks that she has made
                                   a foolish contract, it will set it aside. In one case in St.
                                   Joseph county a man sold a woman feed for her cow and could not
                                   collect the debt. It was to provide against such outrages as
                                   these that the resolution was introduced.
                              The vote on concurrence in the report of the committee resulted as
                                   follows:

                              Pending the roll call--Mr. BOONE, in explanation of his vote, said
                                   he regarded it as much the duty of men to inquire into and
                                   understand the law relating to the rights of married women as the
                                   law regulating contracts with minors, he should therefore vote
                                   "aye."
                              Mr. SCOTT, in explaining his affirmative vote, thought the Senate
                                   was in somewhat the condition that Moses found himself in at one
                                   time; if they were not on holy ground it was at least dangerous.
                                   He was in favor of the spirit of the resolution, but did not
                                   quite like its form. He referred to another bill covering nearly
                                   all the points he desired, and for that reason should vote
                                   "aye;" otherwise he should vote
                                   "no."
                              The vote was then announced as above recorded.
                              So the report was not concurred in.
                              Mr. BROWN moved to amend the resolution by adding, "and to
                                   exercise the elective franchise."
                              Mr. NEFF moved to lay the amendment on the the table.
                              The motion was agreed to by yeas, 27; nays, 14; as follows:

                                             NAYS--Messrs. Beardsley, Bird,
                                                  Boone, Brown, Collett, Dittemore, Dwiggins,
                                                  Freidley of Scott; Steele, Taylor,
                                                  Winterbotham--14.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Pending the roll-call, Mr. HUBBARD, in explanation of his vote,
                                   thought that the subject of the resolution was too serious a
                                   matter to be trifled with, and inasmuch as the Senate did not
                                   seem disposed to treat the matter with the seriousness it
                                   deserved, he should vote to lay the amendment on the table.
                              Mr. SCOTT, when his name was called, said he should vote for the
                                   amendment in all seriousness. It is a matter that will be pressed
                                   here, and will not be considered a trifling matter. The
                                   constitution may need to be amended, but the resolution did not
                                   preclude the inquiry by the committee to ascertain--and it is
                                   very pertinent to ascertain--whether the constitution should not
                                   be amended so as to allow females to vote. Certainly any
                                   proposition which involves the rights of one-half of the citizens
                                   of this State, ought not to be considered a trifling matter.
                              Mr. SLATER, when his name was called, said: Mr. President--No man
                                   possesses a deeper veneration for woman than I possess for her
                                   moral, physical and intellectual nature. But her intellectual
                                   nature is different from that of man. In all Christendom she has
                                   nowhere, with the exception of Wyoming, been admitted to the
                                   rights, power and franchise that man arrogates to men alone. She
                                   plans no sublime campaigns--nor leads armies to battle or fleets
                                   to victory. The honors of the political arena are not for her to
                                   wear or wield, but she may well glory in the hero who is both
                                   able to wear and wield them. Her voice is not for brawling. Its
                                   tender tones are for soothings and caressings. The political
                                   rostrum is too boisterous and rude for her refined nature. Home
                                   is her place of worship, except when, like the star of day, she
                                   deigns to issue forth to the world to exhibit her beauty and
                                   graces, and scatter her smiles upon all who are worthy to receive
                                   so rich a boon, and then she goes back to her home, like as the
                                   sun sinks in the west, and the memory of her presence is like the
                                   soft twilight that lingers long behind a bright departed day. I
                                   therefore vote "aye."
                              The vote was then announced as above recorded.
                              On motion of Mr. THOMPSON, the resolutlon was recommitted to the
                                        Committee on the Judiciary.
                         
                         
                              DRAINAGE LAWS.
                              Mr. HUBBARD, from the Committee on Corporations,
                                   returned the bill [S. 1] to repeal the Drainage law and
                                   supplementary act.
                              Mr. BROWN moved to lay this bill on the table and make it with all
                                   bills on this subject, the special order for Tuesday next at two
                                   o'clock.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE thought the passage of this motion due to the Senator
                                   from Kosciusko (Mr. Chapman) who is absent, and who has a bill on
                                   the files proposing to amend these acts.
                              Mr. STEELE also favored the motion.
                              Mr. HUBBARD thought it would cause delay. The bill is simply a
                                   repealing act, and as it is the intention of all to pass some
                                   kind of drainage laws this bill might as well be passed now. But
                                   such has been the feeling raised by the actions of the Kankakee
                                   Drainage Company that the people in that section are impatient of
                                   delay. There was urgent necessity for immediate action on the
                                   bill.
                              Mr, DWIGGINS said the Kankakee Draining Company had assessed lands
                                   along the river to the amount of four millions eight hundred odd
                                   thousand dollars. They have also filed the bond required by the supplemental act. That
                                   authorized them to put there bonds on the market and sell them.
                                   As soon as those bonds, or any portion of them, are sold, these
                                   assessments are a lien on the entire lands assessed for the
                                   payment of these bonds, which operates as a mortgage on the
                                   lands. In order that the people owning these lands may be
                                   relieved from this enormous mortgage, which will run for fifteen
                                   years, for none of the bonds are for a less period than that,
                                   they have appealed to the courts. They can defeat the present
                                   assessments, as they believe. But he desired to say to the Senate
                                   that these lands constituted the sole property of many of these
                                   people. They have to pay their lawyers' fees and the
                                   costs of court, because not a dollar of costs can be made out of
                                   this company and it will cost the owners of these lands half of
                                   their farms to pay their attorneys' fees and the
                                   expenses of this one appeal, What they fear is this, that the
                                   company may call its assessors together at any time and make a
                                   reassessment upon these lands. Then what? The only remedy is to
                                   again go into court and by the time they get through the court
                                   the second time their homes will be gone, swallowed up in
                                   expenses of litigatfon. This is the reason, he said, why the
                                   friends of this measure are to-day insisting on the repeal of the
                                   act. It may be said that the Kankakee Company has vested rights.
                                   That must be settled in the courts. All we ask of the Legislature
                                   is to relieve ourconstituents as far as they can from the
                                   imposition that has been practiced by the company--for imposition
                                   it is.
                              Mr. BROWN should oppose the repeal of the present drainage laws
                                   until assured some fair bill upon the subject would be
                                   passed.
                              The motion that this bill and similar bills be made the special
                                   order for Tuesday next at two o'clock, p. m., was then
                                   agreed to.
                              On motion of Mr. BROWN, Mr. Chapman's bill [S. 88] to
                                   authorize the structure of levees, dykes, drains and ditches,
                                   took the same course.
                         
                         
                              SOLDIERS' ORPHAN HOME.
                              Mr. BEARDSLEY, from the Committee on Benevolent
                                        Institutions, returned the bill [S. 48] to amend
                                   sections 1 and 8 of the Soldiers' Home act of March 11,
                                   1867, and section 2 of the act of May 14, 1869, supplemental
                                   thereto, with an amendment that any county on whose application
                                   orphans were received be liable for their maintenance,
                                   recommending its passage.
                              The report was concurred in.
                         
                         
                              THE NEW STATE HOUSE.
                              Mr. THOMPSON presented a proposition for the sale of private
                                   grounds for the extension of Capital square, which was referred
                                   to the Committee on Public Buildings.
                              Mr. HOWARD, from the Committee on Rights and Privileges of
                                        the inhabitants of the State, returned the bill
                                   [S. 79] for an amendment to the first section of the mill race
                                   way act of March 1, 1853, to allow any person owning a flouring
                                   mill, or other machinery run by water, to construct a race way
                                   through the property of another person, with a recommendation
                                   that it lie on the table.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              He also returned from the same Committee the bill [S. 80] to amend
                                   the fish law, with amendments and a favorable report thereon.
                              Mr. BEARDSLEY explained that the bill contemplated the exemption of
                                   the St. Joseph river from the provisions of the fish law.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE moved to recommit the bill with instructions to
                                   exempt White river also from the provisions of the bill.
                              Mr. BROWN asked if Salt river was included in the motion. As the
                                   Senator (Mr. Dittemore) had occasion to navigate that stream
                                   occasionally, it might be well for him to include it.
                                   [Laughter.]
                              On motion by Mr. BEARDSLEY this motion to recommit was laid on the
                                   table, by yeas, 24; nays, 17.
                              Mr. COLLETT moved to recommit the bill with instructions to exempt
                                   the Wabash river.
                              On motion by Mr. TAYLOR this motion to recommit was also laid on
                                   the table, by yeas, 23; nays, 18.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS moved to recommit the bill with instructions to report
                                   a bill to repeal the fish law.
                              Pending which the Senate took a recess till two o'clock P.
                                   M.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The PRESIDENT took the chair at 2 o'clock and stated the
                                   consideration of the order of business pending at the time of
                                   taking the recess for dinner.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE saying it being evident that a quorum was not
                                   present, demanded a call of the Senate, but withheld the demand
                                   for a report from a committee.
                              Mr. COLLETT, by consent, from the Committee on
                                        Agriculture, returned the bill [S. 39] to amend
                                   the drainage and wet land
                                   laws, with amendments, and when so amended recommending its
                                   passage.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN moved that the report be concurred in and the
                                   bill lie on the table, and 150 copies be printed for the use of
                                   the Senate.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                         
                         
                              CALUMET FEEDER DAM.
                              Mr. WADGE moved for a suspension of the order of business, that a
                                   communication from the Governor may be read.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Accordingly a communication from the Governor, in response to a
                                   resolution of the Senate concerning the feeder dam across the
                                   Calumet river, at Blue Island, in the State of Illinois, was
                                   read, embracing letters from the Governor of Illinois, with
                                   various other reports and correspondence for the removal of said
                                   dam at Blue island. The Governor says that in view of the fact
                                   that the purpose for which the dam was erected having ceased to
                                   exist in consequence of the feeding of the Illinois and Michigan
                                   Canal from Lake Michigan through the Chicago river instead of
                                   from the Calumet, he felt it to be his duty to use the best
                                   efforts to induce the Illinois authorities to remove the
                                   structure. On the 24th of February, 1872, he appointed Hon. A. L.
                                   Osborne and Hon. W. H. Calkins, Commissioners, on behalf of
                                   Indiana, to proceed to Springfield and confer with the Governor
                                   and General Assembly in relation to the removal of the dam. Mr.
                                   Calkins succeeded in procuring a favorable action in the matter
                                   of the Governor and General Assembly of Illinois, which was
                                   printed at the time Mr. C. made his report to the Governor.
                              Since the receipt of a letter from Governor Palmer, reciting this
                                   action by his General Assembly, Governor Baker has had no further
                                   official information on the subject, but is otherwise informed
                                   that the same has been lowered but not removed, and that an
                                   injunction still exists which prevents the trustees from removing
                                   the dam. It ought to be removed, as it still causes the overflow
                                   of thousands of acres of land, to the great injury of the
                                   property and health of many of the good people of Lake and Porter
                                   counties.
                              The Governor subsequently learned that a court in Cook county had
                                   issued the injunction restraining the Trustees of the Illinois
                                   and Michigan canal from removing the dam. Upon this, he again had
                                   a correspondence with Governor Palmer, which is transmitted to
                                   the Senate with the message. Governor Baker recommends that the
                                   Attorney General, or some other competent agent, be designated by
                                   the General Assembly and directed to proceed to Chicago and learn
                                   the grounds upon which the injunction is based, so that the
                                   General Assembly of the State may have the information on which
                                   to base an appeal to the General Assembly of the State of
                                   Illinois, when it meets in January, for full and speedy relief by
                                   the removal of the dam. It cannot be doubted that such relief
                                   will be afforded when such an appeal is made.
                              Accompanying this is a copy of the account of Messrs. Calkins and
                                   Osborne for their services in the premises, amounting to $500,
                                   which the Governor recommended should be paid.
                              On the call of Mr. DITTEMORE, the exhibits accompanying the message
                                   were read.
                              On motion by Mr. WADGE, the message and accompanying communications
                                   were referred to a select committee of three, to be composed of
                                   Senators from the northwestern portion of the State, and the
                                   following Senators were subsequently appointed as the committee,
                                   viz: Messrs. Wadge, Winterbotham and Hubbard,
                         
                         
                              THE FISH LAW.
                              The PRESIDENT pro tem, (Mr. Rhodes) now recurred
                                   to the order of business pending at the time of the recess for
                                   dinner, being a motion by Mr. Williams to recommit the bill [S.
                                   80] to the Committee on Rights and Privileges,
                                   with instructions for the committee to report a bill repealing
                                   the fish law.
                              Mr. CAVE did not object to the motion, but thought he had a bill on
                                   the files of the Senate for the repeal of the fish law that was
                                   likely to meet the wishes of Senators favoring a repeal of this
                                   law.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS hoped to see the law amended so as to allow the taking
                                   of fish in every way except by netting and seining.
                              Mr. GREGG said the greatest evil in his part of the State is with
                                   those who use nets that are set across the mouth of streams. By
                                   turning the net one way when fish go up the stream, the net
                                   cataches wagon loads of them, and when the fish return to the
                                   large stream the nets are set the other way. He favored a fish
                                   law that would afford a remedy in that particular.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE opposed the present law because it smacks largely of
                                   class legislation, as it gives to gentlemen of leisure the
                                   privilege of doing most all the fishing that is done. His
                                   constituents insist that the law shall be repealed, and he should
                                   so vote in obedience to their wishes
                              Mr. THOMPSON thought that no law on the statute book was more
                                   popular with his
                                   constituency than this fish law, as the fish market had been
                                   vastly improved by it in this vicinity.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS, as a substitute for the motion of Mr. Williams, moved
                                   to recommit with instructions to report a bill to permit fishing
                                   in every manner except by seining.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS accepted the substitute in lieu of his motion.
                              Mr. GREGG again insisted that the use of a set net should be
                                   prohibited, and he moved to amend the amendments by adding a
                                   prohibition against the use of set nets and traps.
                              Mr. HUBBARD moved that the report and pending amendments lie on the
                                   table.
                              Mr. BROWN demanded a division of the question.
                              The amendment (Mr. Gregg's) was laid on the table by yeas,
                                   23 nays 19.
                              The question recurring on laying on the table, the substitute (Mr.
                                   Dwiggin's) being a motion to recommit the bill to the
                                        Committee on Rights and Privileges with
                                   instructions to report a bill permitting fishing in every manner
                                   except by seining. the Senate laid that on the table also by yeas
                                   23, nays 20.
                              The question then recurring on the motion to lay the report of the
                                   Committee on the table, it was agreed to by yeas 35, nays 6.
                              Mr. ROSEBRUGH moved to reconsider the vote just taken and to lay
                                   this motion on the table.
                              The latter motion was agreed to.
                              The order for calling for further reports from committees was taken
                                   up.
                         
                         
                              TIPPECANOE BATTLE GROUND.
                              Mr.TAYLOR, from the select committee thereon, returned the bill [S.
                                   45] for a permanent fence around the Tippecanoe Battle Ground,
                                   with a report narrating a history of the ground since the battle
                                   was fought, reciting a clause of the constitutfon requiring the
                                   General Assembly to provide for its permanent inclosure, and
                                   recommending the appropriation of $25,000 for that purpose, as
                                   follows:
                              Mr. PRESIDENT : The committee to whom referred that portion of the
                                   message of his Excellency Governor Baker, in relation to the
                                   enclosure of the Tippecanoe Battle Ground, and also Senate Bill
                                   No. 45, which provides for the erection of a permanent fence
                                   around said ground, in accordance with the recommendations of the
                                   Governor, beg leave to submit the following report: Your
                                   committee find that theground on which the battle of Tippecanoe
                                   was fought was originally purchased by General John Tipton for
                                   the purpose and design of its permanent preservation and
                                   protection. In the year 1831 a member of the then survivors of
                                   the battie of Tippecanoe, with many other distinguished citizens
                                   of Indiana and Kentucky, assembled on the battle field, and
                                   having collected the scattered remains of those who fell in that
                                   conflict, deposited them, with appropriate funeral rites, in a
                                   common grave, around which a rude fence was made including only
                                   the few feet of ground where the remains were deposited. This
                                   enclosure has long since disappeared and nothing now remains to
                                   mark the spot where lie the bones of the heroic dead who perished
                                   in that memorable battle. In 1833 the General Assembly, by joint
                                   resolution, directed the Governor to ascertain from General
                                   Tipton the terms upon which a title could be obtained for the
                                   State in the ground on which the battle was fought; and
                                   thereafter such action was had by tbe General Assembly, on behalf
                                   of the State and General Tipton, that on the 7th day of November,
                                   1836, the battle ground was conveyed to the State in fee
                                   simple.
                              In the correspondence between Gov. Noble and Gen. Tipton respecting
                                   the conveyance it was well understoood, and so expressed in the
                                   joint resolution on the subject, that the purpose for which the
                                   title was vested in the State was the same as that originally
                                   entertained by General Tipton, viz: Its preservation and
                                   protection. Since the title was thus acquired by the State the
                                   ground has been twice enclosed by temporary fencing, not a
                                   vestage of which now remains. The framers of our present
                                   Constitution were so impressed with the obligation resting upon
                                   the State to protect for all time from rude disturbance this
                                   sacred ground, that they by constitutional enactment recognized
                                   the duty in that regard Section ten, article fifteen, of the
                                   Constitution reads as follows: "It shall be the duty of
                                   the General Assembly to provide for the permanent enclosure and
                                   preservation of the Tippecanoe Battle Ground." This
                                   Constitutional requirement has never been complied with in spirit
                                   or letter only to the extent as before stated, in the erection of
                                   temporary fences. The Board of Commissioners of Tippecanoe county
                                   have recently caused to be made a survey of that portion of the
                                   grounds which needed to be enclosed. Mr. E. M. Talbott, under
                                   whose supervision this survey was made, was also charged with the
                                   additional duty of making an estimate of the probable cost of a
                                   suitable iron fence. The report made by Mr. E. M. Talbott to the
                                   Board of Commissioners
                                   containing a plat of the survey and an estimate of cost is
                                   herewith submitted and made a part of this report. From an
                                   examination of the plat and report it will be seen that the part
                                   to be enclosed will require 3,300 feet of fence at an estimated
                                   cost of $24,100. Your committee would, therefore, recommend that
                                   the blank in section one be filled with the sum of $25,000. And
                                   when so amended would recommend the passage of the bill.
                              HENRY TAYLOR,Com.
                              W. P. RHODES,
                                        Com.
                              J. F. HARNEY,Com.
                              The report was concurred in.
                         
                         
                              MEMORY OF HORACE GREELEY.
                              On motion of Mr. GREGG the regular order of business was suspended
                                   and the resolution introduced by him yesterday in relation to the
                                   death of the Hon. Horace Greeley was taken up.
                              Mr. GREGG said he believed the resolution expressed the unanimous
                                   sentiment of the Senate on this subject. No words are adequate to
                                   express our deep sorrow and regret at hearing of the death of one
                                   of the greatest educators of our people. No other man's
                                   death would create such a sense of profound sorrow and regret
                                   through our country and the civilized world at this time as does
                                   that of Horace Greeley--a man distinguished in everything that is
                                   noble and good, one who leaves behind him a name that will be
                                   honored for all time to come. He was in the broadest sense of the
                                   word an American citizen, a self-made man, superlatively a
                                   successful journalist, a learned statesman and philosopher, a
                                   philanthropist, a friend and an advocate of the down-trodden and
                                   oppressed, without distinction of race or color.
                              The PRESIDENT of the Senate [Mr. Rhodes in the chair] said that for
                                   more than a quarter of a century the name of Horace Greeley has
                                   been prominent before the American people, and in all the events
                                   that have transpired in that time, the most interesting portion
                                   of our country's history, he has borne an honorable and
                                   conspicuous part. Through the columns of his great journal,
                                   circulating in all parts of the country, numbering its readers by
                                   tens of thousands, he has, perhaps, done more to mold and shape
                                   public sentiment in the United States than any man of his time.
                                   Possessed as he was of a noble and generous nature, always
                                   actuated by a broad and genuine philanthrophy, he has throughout
                                   all his public career, both by tongue and pen, plead eloquently
                                   the cause of the poor, the oppressed and the down-trodden. From
                                   the commencement of the agitation of the slavery question in this
                                   country, there has been no truer, no bolder and no abler friend
                                   of the slave than has been Horace Greeley. With him the cause of
                                   human freedom was paramount and above mere party considerations.
                                   He was a stranger to the ignorant and unholy prejudice of caste,
                                   which has so long degraded a race in our midst; and if to-day
                                   that wicked prejudice is rapidly disappearing from among our
                                   people, and if to-day the lash has fallen from the hands of the
                                   slave driver forever; if to-day no fetters are on the limbs of
                                   bond men in all this land; if to-day our flag floats over no
                                   slave in our broad domain, we ought to remember that Horace
                                   Greeley has contributed his full share to the accomplishment of
                                   this grand triumph. And when the history of this anti-slavery
                                   struggle is written the name of Greeley will stand side by side
                                   with the names of those that adorn the brightest pages of
                                   American history.
                              Mr. HUBBARD moved to amend the resolution by striking out all after
                                   the word "resolved" and inserting the
                                   following: "That as a mark of respect to him, these
                                   resolutions be spread upon the journals of the Senate."
                                   He said that he would allow no man to go before him in cherishing
                                   recollections of the memory and services of Horace Greeley, but
                                   we are here engaged in a work for the people of the State, and he
                                   did not think that our respect for the illustrious dead requires
                                   that we shall waste any more time than is necessary. Senators are
                                   aware that there is much work for us to do, and we ought not,
                                   when there is no occasion for it, to waste a day at this time of
                                   the session.
                              Mr. BROWN. I trust that the Senate will not be insensible to the
                                   importance of the occasion. The death of a just man always
                                   strikes the community, and indeed the death of Mr. Greeley has
                                   struck it, I think, as forcibly as the death of any man during
                                   the last half century. And l think the great works of the
                                   deceased have been of sufficient importance and benefit to the
                                   people that this mark of respect proposed by the resolution
                                   offered by the Senator from Dearborn, is but a poor pittance and
                                   a poor reward for the great good he has done the people of the
                                   country. I hope that the Senate will change the resolution that
                                   has just been offered by the Senator from St. Joseph [Mr.
                                   Hubbard] so that it will not read that it proposes to strike out
                                   the resolution offered by the Senator from Dearborn, [Mr. Gregg]
                                   but that it will be a resolution to accompany that of the Senator
                                   from Dearborn, so that the
                                   Senate will adjourn on to-morrow, the day upon which his body is
                                   to be given to the earth, and that the record of this occasion
                                   may be made up along with the other records of this body.
                              I have no eulogy to pronounce upon him. His fame, his name his
                                   reputation need none. They speak for themselves. He sprang from
                                   the lowly and humble waIks of life. By energy, by industry, by
                                   perseverance, by honesty and diligence he carved out for himself
                                   a name and fame that any American citizen may well feel proud of.
                                   When a man makes for himself a name of being a universal friend
                                   and benefactor of the human race, he makes for himself a fame and
                                   a name that any man might well be proud of. And after the heat of
                                   party zeal and party victory has passed away, and when reason and
                                   soberness shall perform their sacred office, all the people in
                                   this country who have intelligence to reason and hearts to do
                                   right will see that Horace Greeley had identified himself with
                                   those occasions that were for the best interests of the country
                                   and the happiness of the people. He is gone! But "it is
                                   not all of life to live, nor all of death to die." I
                                   trust that that body of his which lies beyond the grave is as
                                   bright and glorious as that which awaits the coming of any man
                                   who has done honor to himself, credit to his people and justice
                                   to his Maker.
                              Mr.DITTEMORE moved to make the resolution offered by the Senator
                                   from St. Joseph (Mr. Hubbard) a part of the resolution offered by
                                   the Senator from Dearborn (Mr. Gregg).
                              Mr. HUBBARD, as it seemed to be the sense of the Senate, consented
                                   to this.

                                             RESOLVED, That as a mark of
                                                  appreciation of the genius of the man when living,
                                                  and respect to his memory now that he has gone to
                                                  his rest, this preamble and resolutions be spread
                                                  upon the journals of the House.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              On motion of Mr. RUMSEY, the matter was referred to a special
                                   committee, viz.: Messrs. Rumsey, Hardesty, Cauthorn, Buskirk, and
                                   Richardson.
                              A message from the Governor by the hand of John M. Commons, his
                                   Private Secretary, was now received, transmitting the annual
                                   report of the Trustees and Superintendent of the Institution for
                                   the Education of the Deaf and Dumb.
                         
                         
                              THE CANAL BOND QUESTION.
                              Also, a message from the Governor in relation to the unsurrendered
                                   Internal Improvement Bonds. It is as follows: [See Appendix, p.
                                   21.]
                         
                         
                              REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES--DRAINAGE.
                              Mr. BUTTERWORTH, from theCornmittee on Swamp Lands, returned Mr.
                                   Martin's bill [H. R. 76] to amend the act of March 11,
                                   1867, to enable the owners of wet lands to drain and reclaim them
                                   where the same can be done without affecting the rights of
                                   others, with amendments. In section 6 for "Common
                                   Pleas" insert "Circuit or Common Pleas
                                   Court." Add the following: "Sec. 8. When the
                                   assessors have presented the benefits or damages to any tract of
                                   land and have made an error therein, such error may be amended on
                                   trial in court, the said error being alleged in the complaint and
                                   proved on the trial;" and so amended the committee
                                   recommend the passage of the bill.
                              The amendments were adopted.
                              Mr. BUTTERWORTH. This bill was most heartily endorsed by every
                                   member of the Swamp Lands Committee. It is an amendment to the
                                   act of 1867--not the Kankakee swindle. It is what is called
                                   "the one man Drainage Law." The amendments are
                                   important. They were introduced by bill into the Legislature two
                                   years11 ago, but failed on
                                   account of the breaking up. They afford legal facilities for
                                   improvements four or five miles long.
                              Mr. HELLER. It is difficult to grasp all the provisions of so long
                                   a bill, and I move that 200 copies be printed.
                              Mr. JOHNSON. The Committee on the Judiciary have
                                   now under consideration the bill of the gentleman from St. Joseph
                                   [Mr. Butterworth] to repeal the Kankakee Drainage Law; and as
                                   this bill will in some measure be a substitute for that law, it
                                   strikes me that it should go to the committee where the other is.
                                   The Judiciary Committee may offer amendments
                                   to it, and therefore they should have it before it is printed.
                                   The Committee would like to examine them together.
                              Mr. BUSKIRK opposed printing. The amendments are very brief, and
                                   the law of 1867 we can read for ourselves. Whilst it might be
                                   well enough to print the amendments, I see no necessity for
                                   printing the bill at large. I think, also, that the bill should
                                   go to the Judiciary Committee. In the statute
                                   of 1852, concerning drains, it is provided that the question of
                                   public utility in any proposed work shall be triable by jury, and
                                   I believe that this provision is not in either of the statutes of
                                   1867 or 1869. Now I think that a provision of this kind ought to
                                   be incorporated into this act.
                              Mr. GREGORY. The gentlemen from Marion (Mr. Johnson) is mistaken.
                                   This bill is in no sense a substitute for the Kankakee drainage
                                   law. That provides for drainage by corporations; this does not.
                                   It is the one-man drainage law. It answers a different
                                   purpose--goes to a different object.
                              Mr. BUSKIRK. It proposes to take another man's land. It
                                   touches the doctrine of eminent domain, and therefore I think it
                                   ought to go to the Judiciary Committee.
                              The bill was laid on the table and ordered to be
                                   printed--affirmative 39, negative 30.
                         
                         
                              COAL MINES REGULATIONS.
                              Mr. GIFFORD, from the select committee thereon, returned his bill
                                   [H. R. 83] to provide for the health and safety of persons
                                   employed in the coal mines, with amendments, recommending
                                   passage.
                              The bill and amendments were referred to the Committee on
                                        the Judiciary.
                              Mr. WILSON, from the Committee on Insurance,
                                   returned Mr. Kimball's bill [H. R. 36] to amend the
                                   charter of the Franklin Insurance Company, with an amendment
                                   striking out the third section, changing name and increasing the
                                   capital stock.
                              The amendment was adopted and so the bill was ordered to be
                                   engrossed.
                         
                         
                              OLD STATE BONDS--LIABILITY.
                              Mr. GREGORY submitted the following:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, That the Attorney
                                                  General be requested to submit to the House his
                                                  written opinion upon the following propositions,
                                                  to wit:
                                             FIRST. What additional liability
                                                  either moral, legal or equitable, if any, would
                                                  the State incur as to the outstanding Internal
                                                  Improvement bonds by paying the judgment of John
                                                  W. Garrett, recently recovered in the Cass Circuit
                                                  Court, against the Trustees of the Wabash and Erie
                                                  Canal?
                                             SECOND. In what position as to
                                                  the payment of the bonds included in the Butler
                                                  bills would this State be placed if she permitted
                                                  the Wabash and Erie canal and other internal
                                                  improvements upon the Garrett judgment as a lien
                                                  to be sold to satisfy the judgment of John W.
                                                  Garrett recently recovered in the Cass Circuit
                                                  Court against the Trustees of the Wabash and Erie
                                                  canal?
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Mr. KIMBALL. It is unnecessary to call for that information, the
                                   Governor having already been called on for his opinion in the
                                   same matter by the gentleman from Knox. He made an ineffectual
                                   motion to lay the resolution on the table.
                              Mr. GREGORY. I understand that the resolution of the gentleman from
                                   Knox (Mr. Cauthorn) relates only to the history of legislation on
                                   this question. The information sought in this resolution, is
                                   intended to place the House in a better position to act upon the
                                   bill introduced by the gentleman from Marion county (Mr. Kimball)
                                   to pay the Garrett judgment.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN, for that very reason, was opposed to the resolution.
                                   The gentleman from White (Mr. Gregory) is a lawyer, and I think
                                   it unnecessary to ask the Attorney General to give his opinion in
                                   a matter that we ought to examine for ourselves--rather let
                                   gentlemen go into the facts and the law and make up their own
                                   opinion. Besides, we have already the opinion of the Governor,
                                   and of such lawyers as Hendricks, Hord and Hendricks. But let us
                                   not seek for other men's opinions and undertake to hold
                                   them responsible for our own acts; but let us act on our own
                                   intelligence.
                              Mr. KIMBALL saw no necessity for calling for further information in
                                   this matter from the Attorney General or anybody else. This
                                   question has been discussed for the last twenty years. On every
                                   platform in the State it has had the maturest consideration, and
                                   the House should not waste time on it. There is a bill before the
                                   House to pay that Garrett judgment, and delays are dangerous: for
                                   if the time (Dec. 27th) passes by withou paying it, then will
                                   come the process for the
                                   sale of the canal property. Gentlemen should act on their own
                                   judgment in this matter. I understand Democrats and Republicans
                                   here are prepared and ready vote for this bill, and against every
                                   proposition that may be brought against it.
                              Mr. RICHARDSON. I am prepared for this question, though I was not
                                   when I first took my seat here. I am ready to go upon the record;
                                   and therefore opposed to the delay that this resolution
                                   contemplates.
                              Mr. GREGORY proposed to vote intelligenty and to be thoroughly
                                   advised in this matter. The reason I introduced this matter is,
                                   that, when I talk with the politicians about these questions, I
                                   find that they disagree, predicating their opinions on different
                                   statements of facts. I do not propose to act upon the Attorney
                                   General's opinion, but I seek for advice upon a question
                                   of much gravity and importance. As to the bill pending in the
                                   House [Mr. Kimball's] there is question as to its
                                   propriety, because there are still some of these old bonds
                                   outstanding, and their number and amount is unknown. There are
                                   loopholes in the bill--occasions for quibble.--There is yet
                                   something hidden in this matter which we have a right to
                                   know.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. There was no loophole in the bill wherein a quibble
                                   could come anyway. It is to provide for that portion of the 191
                                   bonds which are a lien on the canal. It should go to the
                                        Committee on Ways and Means be returned
                                   early to the House.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY said the question had left the domain of politics, and
                                   was now only a legal one. He doubted if any lawyer in the House
                                   could say he saw his way clearly through it. He favored the
                                   resolution because he wanted all the information he could
                                   get.
                              Mr. HELLER could not understand why any gentleman should try to
                                   suppress investigation. He was not clear as to his duty in the
                                   case. If compelled to vote without further light he would feel
                                   impelled to vote against the payment of any bonds.
                              Mr. BUSKIRK, though a lawyer, was not prepared to vote upon the
                                   pending bill. The gentleman from Marion, as a partisan, might be
                                   prepared to do so, but he was not prepared to treat it in that
                                   way. He favored the resolution.
                              Mr. JOHNSON. Gentlemen have not been careful observers of events.
                                   The Governor has been at much pains in two of his messages to
                                   discuss this question in its legal aspects, and he has submitted
                                   the question to that distinguished legal firm, Hendricks, Hord
                                   & Hendricks, and they have given their opinion
                                   corroborating that of the Governor, that the State is liable for
                                   these outstanding bonds; and that unless they are paid they will
                                   become a lien upon the canal and compel its sequestration ; and
                                   thereby the State will become liable, responsible for the payment
                                   of the surrendered bonds, amounting to many millions. Referring
                                   to the Cass Circuit Court judgment for Garrett, he thought that
                                   when a court had rendered judgment upon case, the opinion of a
                                   lawyer would not be worth anything.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN raised the point of order that the discussion was
                                   taking a range not warranted by the resolution.
                              The point was sustained.
                              The question being upon the adoption of the resolution, the yeas
                                   and nays were ordered, resulting--yeas 47, nays 33, as
                                   follows:

                                             NAYS--Messrs. Auderson, Barker,
                                                  Baxter, Butterworth, Broadus, Clark, Cobb, Cole,

                                                  Spellman, Tingley, Wilson of Jay, Wolflin,
                                                  Woollen, Wood and Woodard--33.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              So the resolution was adopted.
                              The Speaker now took up the call of the House by counties and
                                   districts for--
                         
                         
                              NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                              Mr. WESNER, a bill [H. R. 156] to amend sections 4, 9, 10, 11, and
                                   12 of the Liquor License Act.
                              It was referred to the Committee on Rights and
                                        Privileges.
                              Mr. RICHARDSON, a bill [H. R. 157] to authorize the refunding of
                                   taxes collected in several counties for the years 1869-70. [On
                                   account of increase of assessments.]
                              It was referred to the Judiciary Committee.
                              By Mr. OFFUTT, a bill [H. R. 158] declaring all railroad companies
                                   common carriers, regulating passenger fare and the tariff of
                                   freight, requiring them to receive and discharge freight and
                                   passengers at all their stations, and prescribing penalties.
                              It was referred to the Judiciary Committee.
                              The message of the Governor transmitting information, this morning,
                                   in answer to the resolution
                                   of inquiry touching the question of the unsurrendered internal
                                   improvement bonds, was taken up, and, on motion of Mr. Branham,
                                   one thousand copies were ordered to be printed.
                         
                         
                              ORDERS OF THE DAY.
                              On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the House took up the orders of the day.
                                   The Speaker laid before the House the message of the Governor
                                   transmitting the Annual Report of the Trustees and Superintendent
                                   of the Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, recommending the
                                   adoption of a concurrent resolution for printing 5,000
                                   copies.
                              Mr. KING. Provision for the printing is already made by law.
                              The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Governor
                                   transmitting the report or the Treasurer of State for the fiscal
                                   year ending October 31, 1872.
                              It was ordered to be printed.
                              The Common Pleas Court bill [S. 8] was read the first time.
                              On motion of Mr. MILLER, Mr. Kimball's bill [H. R. 129] to
                                   protect the Wabash and Erie Canal, and the tolls and revenues
                                   thereof, from sale or sequestration for the satisfaction of
                                   unsurrendered bonds, was taken up and referred to the Committee
                                   on Ways and Means.
                         
                         
                              HOUSE OF REFUGE.
                              Mr. Baxter's bill [H. R. 92] to amend the act of March 8,
                                   1867, to establish a House of Refuge, and repealing section 11 of
                                   said act, was takau up on the final reading.
                              Mr. BAXTER. The principal feature of the bill is to make the age of
                                   admission 16 years instead of 18 years, and to obviate the
                                   difficulty which has invited and brought in persons 22 and 23
                                   years of age, instead of mere youths, which is to defeat the
                                   object of the House of Refuge. Another provision is that the
                                   money shall be paid by the State Treasurer into the hands of the
                                   Treasurer of that institution, as it comes into his possession.
                                   Another feature is that parents, etc, are allowed to introduce
                                   inmates in certain cases by paying their expenses.
                              It was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas, 92; nays,
                                   3.
                         
                         
                              EXEMPTION LAWS.
                              Mr. Shirley's bill [H. R. 30] to so amend the 445th
                                   section of the practice act so as to reduce the restriction of
                                   the sale of property under execution to one-half the appraised
                                   value, was rejected on the third reading, by yeas, 27; nays,
                                   57.
                         
                         
                              CITY IMPROVEMENTS.
                              Mr. Branham's bill [H. R. 71] to amend section 60 of the
                                   city corporation act of March 14, 1867, authorizing cities on
                                   petition to extend aid to other than railroad enterprises, was
                                   taken up on the final reading.
                              Mr. WALKER. This is the bill that failed the other day, for want of
                                   a few votes, to get the constitutional majority. Gentlemen who
                                   have heretofore been against it, it seems did not understand it.
                                   I therefore desire to make this statement. It introduces no new
                                   principle of law. It is an exact copy of section sixty of the act
                                   already in force, and it amends that by giving to city councils
                                   authority, on petition, to aid in the construction of public
                                   improvements, building or works of public utility of permanent
                                   value to the city, in cases where a majority of the freeholders
                                   petition for them. It neither adds to nor takes from the legal
                                   provisions for city aid to railroads and macadamized roads. It
                                   can in no way affect non residents of the cities. It can not
                                   reach to thecountry. Neither the old law nor this admit of this
                                   aid on a majority of the citizens or tax-payers, but it must be
                                   upon petition of a majority of the freeholders. In behalf of the
                                   people where I reside. I ask for this bill the cordial support of
                                   the House.
                              The bill finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas 69, nays
                                   16.
                              Mr. Johnson's bill [H. R. 137] to amend the criminal
                                   practice act of June 17,1852, was considered, and ordered to be
                                   engrossed.
                              Messrs. Brett, Hedrick and Given presented claims, and Mr. Hatch
                                   presented the petition of citizens of Newton county, for the
                                   repeal of the Kankakee drainage law, which were referred, under
                                   the rule.
                              The House took a recess till two o'clock p. m.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The SPEAKER resumed the chair at 2 o'clock p. m., and took
                                   up the special order of the day, viz: Mr. Wilson of
                                   Ripley's Mileage and Per Diem bill [H.R.73.]
                              Mr. BUTTERWORTH, on whose motion the special order had been made,
                                   in view of the sparse attendance of members, moved that the bill
                                   be referred to the Committee on Ways and
                                   Means.
                              It was so ordered.
                              The SPEAKER then returned to the call of the roll for
                         
                         
                         
                              NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                              Mr. WALKER introduced a bill [H. R. 159] to regulate the practice
                                   of dentistry in the State of Indiana. Dentist to hold a diploma,
                                   or a certificate of qualification from the State Dental
                                   Association. Penalty, $10 to $200.]
                              It was referred to the Judiciary Committee.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN, a bill [H. R. 61] to abolish the Court of Common
                                   Pleas in the State, and establish a Probate Court in each county;
                                   to provide for the judges thereof, their compensrtion, and the
                                   transfer of business to the Circuit and Probate Courts.
                              It was referred to the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary
                         
                         
                              CORRECTION ON CITY TAX LISTS.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN introduced a bill [H. R. 162] for an act to authorize
                                   cities to correct erroneous listings in the description or
                                   assessment of real estate liable for city taxes, and when
                                   corrected to collect all taxes due thereon, and to authorize them
                                   in to order the correction of false and fraudulent lists of
                                   property or the value thereof. He explained the provisions of the
                                   bill at length. It gives the city authority, where real estate
                                   has been iricorrectly listed or described, to change and correct
                                   it. The second section is to enable cities to correct erroneous
                                   or fraudulent listings by taxpayers--I will move for a suspension
                                   of the rules and restrictions that it may be at once put upon its
                                   passage.
                              The restrictions were suspended and the bill was finally passed the
                                   House of Represervatives; yeas, 72; nays, 2.
                         
                         
                              EMPYRICISM IN MBDICINE.
                              The SPEAKER announced the consideration on the third reading of Mr.
                                   Satterwhite's bill [H. R. 101] for protection from
                                   empyricism, and to elevate the medical profession.
                              Mr. WOODARD objected to the bill because he desired the largest
                                   liberty to employ any physician of his own choosing. It requires
                                   practice to make a good doctor. Practice makes a good
                                   doctor--better than theory.
                              Mr. WILLARD had conferred with physicians, and the fault they find
                                   with it is that it does not do enough. It is well known that any
                                   man to-day can send to various medical colleges and secure a
                                   diploma for $10. This bill shuts out those who have studied under
                                   a physician but are without a diploma. We want a bill that shall
                                   establish a medieal board in each county, before whom physicians
                                   shall be able to stand an examination. The diploma system has
                                   been proved to be a fraud. I shall oppose this bill, in hopes of
                                   finding a better one.
                              Mr. GIFFORD. The gentleman (Mr. Woodard) thinks it not necessary
                                   for a physician to be a professional man. That may be true : but
                                   the bill provides that a man qualified by practice shall be
                                   admitted to practice. Many good physicians never had a diploma.
                                   So far as this bill is concerned, I believe it covers all the
                                   ground, and I shall support it.
                              Mr. BUSKIRK. For my part, I claim it as an inalienable right, if I
                                   prefer some old woman to doctor me, if I find that she does me
                                   more good than the city physician--if I so decide on my own
                                   responsibility, I claim the right to employ her. I believe with
                                   Oliver Holmes, that if all the medicine were thrown into the sea,
                                   it would be better for men, but death to the fish. [Laughter.] I
                                   believe in homoeopathy and hydropathy, and all the pathies, and I
                                   shall vote against exclusive privileges in medicine.
                              Mr. BUTTERWORTH. I think I shall vote against the bill, but I wish
                                   to remove the impression that it is in the interests of the
                                   allopathic school. It provides that no man shall practice without
                                   a diploma or a certificate. It places all the pathies on an
                                   equality. The object of the bill is simply to require of every
                                   man who pretends to be a doctor that he shall understand what he
                                   professes. My objection to the bill is this: It would throw out
                                   those mothers-in-Israel who practice obstetrics.
                              Mr. WALKER would support the bill. It was mild in form--directed
                                   against no particular school--but it would label the poisoner, as
                                   the law does now the poison. It will reach the scores of empyrics
                                   and quacks who are going out everywhere in the State, to whose
                                   story the suffering people will listen, pay their last dollar and
                                   receive no benefit. The school teacher must have the certificate
                                   of qualification, and should we not require of the physician
                                   having the care of our health that he also shall give assurance
                                   of qualification? If it would be more satisfactory to the
                                   gentleman from Gibson [Mr. Buskirk] let the provisions of the
                                   bill be so changed as to give him a midwife. I would not divorce
                                   him from his inalienable rights. Our county medical societies
                                   ramify every county in the State, and if the emulous doctors have
                                   not the requisite knowledge of books, let them be remanded to
                                   them till they shall be qualified for their responsible work.
                              
                              Mr. RICHARDSON felt very little interest in the bill, but
                                   discovered that gentlemen were considering it under a
                                   misapprehension. It was not in the interests of physicians, but
                                   of the people. Medical men would hear him out in this statement.
                                   Their indifference to the bill is because it does not go far
                                   enough to secure the required protection. Do gentlemen fear that
                                   some old lady, or some particular friend may not be permitted to
                                   practice medicine? Why does the gentleman from Gibson claim the
                                   right to employ his own physician, so long as the Constitution of
                                   the State does not allow him to employ a lawyer who has not a
                                   good moral character?
                              Mr. HATCH. This bill is for the protection of the people.
                                   Physicians do not need protection. I support the bill because
                                   graduates of every school having certificates of the county
                                   medical society, would by its provisions be admitted to
                                   practice--giving every medical school credit for sound
                                   instruction in anatomy and physiology--the groundwork in the
                                   practice of medicine.
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE introduced this bill, though not of the medical
                                   profession. He had consulted a number of physicians as to its
                                   provisions, and some had submitted a few suggestions, amounting
                                   to nothing It was similar to the law of the State of Ohio, which
                                   seems to work well there. It is more in the interests of the
                                   people than of the profession, and I think it may be at least a
                                   stepping stone to something better.
                              Mr. MELLETT. I feel very much disposed to protect myself from
                                   quacks, but I question whether this bill will do it. The tests
                                   which it proposes for a physician are three: First--a diploma
                                   from a medical college, which, although not conclusive evidence
                                   of a physician's fitness, it is in that direction.
                                   Next--a certificate from a medical board. And the third test is
                                   the pandora's box that lets out all the evils; it
                                   requires that he shall have one of the two certificates
                                   mentioned, or he shall have been a practicing physician for ten
                                   years. I should prefer that it read one year instead of ten, for
                                   the quack of one year is not as bad as the quack of ten
                                   years.
                              The bill failed on the final reading--yeas 40, nays 36--for lack of
                                   the constitutional majority.
                         
                         
                              CHANGE OF VENUE.
                              Mr. Offutt's bill [H. R. 104] to amend the seventy-eighth
                                   section of the criminal practice and procedure act of June 17,
                                   1852 (taking away the discretion of the judge as to the change of
                                   venue upon affidavit of prejudice in criminal causes), was taken
                                   up in order on the third reading.
                              Mr. OFFUTT. We have been reminded time and again that all members
                                   of this body are not lawyers; and perhaps all do not understand
                                   the purpose and object of this proposed change or amendment of
                                   the law as it now stands. This bill proposes to place the
                                   criminal and civil law on the question of a change of venue on
                                   the same footing. The law now provides that changes of venue in
                                   civil cases shall be granted by the judge upon proper evidence,
                                   setting forth the fact of the existence of undue prejudice or
                                   excitement; the criminal law leaves it discretionary with the
                                   judge in such cases, to grant or refuse the change. This bill
                                   proposes to amend the law so as to make it absoluteso as to take
                                   away the discretionary power of the judge, as it is now done in
                                   civil cases. I think that in cases where a man's life or
                                   liberty is involved, he ought to have a change of venue quite as
                                   readily as where his property only is concerned. And as the House
                                   has already voted to refuse to go back and give the judge his
                                   discretion as to a change of venue in civil cases, it would seem
                                   that it ought to be ready to support this bill.
                              Mr. MILLER considered that much the larger portion of the
                                   affidavits for a change of venue in criminal cases, are either
                                   founded in perjury or in a misapprension of the parties. It seems
                                   to me that it is always possible, in any ordinaay case, to get an
                                   unprejudiced jury, and the constitution requires trial by a jury
                                   of peers. And when you come to apply the law, as it is here
                                   proposed to be amended, you will give to nine-tenths of the
                                   criminals the means to prevent a trial. It would become a part of
                                   the practice to change the venue. Nearly every criminal wants
                                   timetime for witnesses to die or move away; and the result would
                                   be the avoidance of trial. Another objection to the bill would be
                                   the immense expense which it would devolve upon the officers of
                                   the court and the State, in the service of process and the
                                   continued application for allowance of witnesses. I think the
                                   whole policy of the bill is in the interests of the criminal.
                              Mr. WILSON of Ripley. I hope this bill will pass. The State has no
                                   interest in punishment unless the party is guilty. The
                                   Constitution credits the presumption of innocence and grants the
                                   right of an impartial trial. It has been remarked that in civil
                                   cases, where there is nothing but the question of the right of
                                   property, the judge has not the discretion to refuse a change of venue, whilst in
                                   criminal cases, where life and liberty are in the issue, the
                                   discretion is with the judge. I have seen in many cases where the
                                   change has not been granted, that it has been because the court
                                   itself partook of the local prejudice. We ought to afford and
                                   secure to every citizen a fair trial; and we ought not to repose
                                   on the judgment of any one man to say whether there is or is not
                                   undue or unsafe prejudice or excitement. If we were to proceed
                                   upon the ground that every man charged with crime is guilty, I
                                   could see the force of the gentleman from Decatur's
                                   argument. There has been a bill introduced here [Mr.
                                   Lenfesty's] to make the civil practice conform to the
                                   criminal in changes of venue; and the Judiciary
                                        Committee reported for its indefinite
                                   postponement, because they considered that the judge should not
                                   have the discretion to refuse. I repeat my observation that
                                   whenever this discretion has been used, it has been uniformly
                                   against the prisoner; and but for the prejudice of the judge the
                                   change of venue would have been granted. The judge is but a
                                   man--having the passions and impulses of a man--partaking of the
                                   feelings and preposessions of the people, and controled by the
                                   same prejudices.
                              Mr. SHUTT considered that the changes of venue result in the
                                   avoidance of justice, and certainly in much expense and vexation
                                   without pay. I think the criminal ought to get justice at home.
                                   There isdanger of too much sympathy for him.
                              Mr. COBB also considered the danger of too much sympathy for the
                                   criminal. If this recommendation of the Judiciary
                                        Committee is right--and I think it is--then had we
                                   not better leave the law as it is? because witnesses and others
                                   have to attend these trials, by order of court at a great
                                   distance, and receive no pay; and I do not question, that in many
                                   cases, where these changes of venue would be made, criminals that
                                   .would escape by them would be those who are guilty of the most
                                   heinous crimes. And if this be so, I think we ought not to
                                   increase the facilities for a change of venue. Now we have in
                                   various parts of the country parties organizing vigilance
                                   committees and lynch law. This of course, is all wrong; but it
                                   has its origin in the want of wisdom and vigilance in the
                                   law-making power. It seems to me that instead of making it more
                                   easy for the crimial to escape, we ought to frame the laws to
                                   make it more difficult for him to escape. It seems to me that the
                                   presumption of innocence till the prisoner is proved guilty is
                                   enough. I believe that experience teaches us that in nine cases
                                   out of ten the ends of justice in these cases do not require
                                   either continuance or change, and the judges generally recognize
                                   this doctrine. It seems to me that this bill ought not to
                                   pass--that we have gone far enough in that direction. Reaction
                                   may be good; but we should be guarded and careful not to go to
                                   far in reactionary measures.
                              Mr. OFFUTT. I have but a few words to add in support of this
                                   measure. Gentlemen have presented what might seem to be very good
                                   reasoning; but this is not a question of dollars and cents; it is
                                   a question of right and wrong. If it be right that the law should
                                   be amended in this respect, the question of the additional
                                   expense should not be taken into consideration. It has been said
                                   by one gentleman that criminal cases should be tried by a jury of
                                   peers, and he urges therefore that the bill should not pass. Now,
                                   I understand that by the Constitution of the State the jury is
                                   made judge of the law and the testimony. Still there is not a
                                   Judge but will lay down the law. But it is said that the criminal
                                   will change the venue till he wears out the patience of the
                                   Prosecuting Attorney, and till the witnesses either die or remove
                                   away, and thus the criminal will escape. But the gentleman has
                                   forgotten that the law only tolerates the change of venue, and I
                                   undertake to say that the objection raised by the gentleman is
                                   not such an objection as should have weight in determining
                                   whether this bill is right or wrong. It has been well remarked by
                                   the gentleman from Ripley, that where a man's life is
                                   involved, his rights should be as well secured as they are in
                                   cases where only his property is at stake. [He read from the
                                   statute the provisions with reference to the change of venue in
                                   the civil and in the criminal practice.] So we see that in civil
                                   cases it makes it imperative on the Judge to grant the change on
                                   the proper application; but when it comes to cases involving life
                                   and liberty then you will trust the Judge, arid give him the
                                   discretionalthough the affidavit may be filed in truth, he has it
                                   in his power to say to the prisoner: "Sir, you shall be
                                   tried before me, whether you are guilty or, innocent" I
                                   say it in all candor and seriousness, this law is wrong; and that
                                   where a man's life or liberty is at stake, and where
                                   undue prejudice or excitement exists, he ought to be tried by
                                   impartial triers. My experience is, that where the Judge is
                                   impartial he will seldom refuse to grant the change. I think the
                                   bill is eminently just and
                                   in the spirit of the Constitution, I say, sir, be a man guilty or
                                   innocent, he is entitled to a fair trial, to be tried by
                                   impartial triers, and in a county and by a jury that is not
                                   prejudiced or biassed against him. I think the bill ought to
                                   commend itself at once to the judgment of the House, and
                                   especially to the legal profession.
                              Mr. WALKER. As to the analogy between civil and criminal cases;
                                   ordinarily in civil cases they have no notoriety in the
                                   counry--they are not spoken of enough to prejudice men's
                                   minds so as to authorize a change of venue. Yet the State makes
                                   it imperative, takes the discretion of denial away from the
                                   court. Criminal cases, on the contrary, have notoriety; and the
                                   law is to provide against the too easy change of the venue in
                                   those cases that necessarily have notoriety, and are of such a
                                   character as necessarily to divide the minds of the citizens. I
                                   will not vote to retard the execution of the criminal laws; I
                                   would be in favor of its more rigorous administration. I would be
                                   in favor of giving the State the right to close the
                                   pleadings--the old principal of law. I would not be understood as
                                   voting for liberality in this direction by my vote on this bill;
                                   but this is the consideration: a criminal should have as fair a
                                   hearing as he can have in a civil case. My observation has been
                                   that some of our popular judges sometimes desire the notoriety of
                                   trying a celebrated case; but I simply wanted to draw a
                                   distinction between the notoriety of civil and criminal
                                   cases.
                              Mr. LENFESTY. I am Interested in the defeat of this bill. It has
                                   been urged as one reason why this bill should pass, that as to a
                                   change of venue in civil cases the judge has no discretion. I
                                   introduced a bill to give him that discretion, and it was
                                   reported against. It is well understood that the administration
                                   of justice in our criminal practice is very expensive, and if
                                   this bill should pass I apprehend that it would increase the
                                   expense of the administration of justice three times over. What
                                   would be the result? Why, in every case, even where a boy might
                                   trespass on a neighbor's grounds, he may go into court,
                                   and there, by filing his affidavit--no matter what the
                                   pretense--he may take a change of venue to onother county.
                              Mr. OFFUTT. In cases of misdemeanor the defendant pays the costs.
                                   The gentleman's presumption of perjury is unfounded.
                              Mr. LENFESTY. I think that I am supported in the assertion that
                                   whenever the criminal requires a change of venue, he will not
                                   hesitate about the oath. The ends of justice are not so often
                                   defeated in the home trials. But I can call to mind cases where
                                   justice has been defeated by changes of the venue, and they open
                                   a door to perjury, and make a large bill of expenses. And hence,
                                   also, I believe that the bill I introduced should have been
                                   passed. For where property is destroyed by the railroads they pay
                                   no attention to the first trial, and appeal the case to some
                                   other court. [Cries of "order, order!" The
                                   SPEAKER. The gentleman from Grant will proceed.] I propose to
                                   show that instead of taking away the discretion of the judge in
                                   criminal cases, it should be exercised in civil as well as
                                   criminal cases, and I simply call attention to the fact that
                                   where stock is killed by the railroad, the farmer is virtually
                                   cheated out of his stock by not being able to follow the railroad
                                   company in their changes of venue.
                              The bill was rejected--yeas, 10; nays, 68.
                         
                         
                              IMPROVEMENT OF THE PUBLIC REVENUES.
                              Mr. KIMBALL presented a preamble and resolution requesting the
                                   Auditor of State to communicate to the House his suggestions for
                                   the improvement of the public revenues.
                              It was adopted.
                              Mr. WYNN submitted a resolution for an order (which was adopted)
                                   that the Secretary of State furnish a price list of the articles
                                   of stationery furnished to members of this House.
                              Mr. BRANHAM, on account of pressing business before the committees,
                                   moved for the adjournment.
                              Mr. WOODARD submitted a resolution (which was adopted) that a
                                   committee of five be appointed by the Speaker whose duty it shall
                                   be to inquire what legislation, if any, is necessary to protect
                                   the people of the State from oppressive taxation by counties and
                                   townships; and report by bill or otherwise.
                              The SPEAKER That committee will consist of the gentleman and
                                   others--five members of the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means.
                              Mr. MELLETT presented the petition of 378 citizens of Delaware
                                   county protesting against aiding the State Univerity to establish
                                   a Medical College, on the ground that it will be
                                   sectarian--controlled by one school.
                              The House then adjourned.

                         HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                         
                              WEDNESDAY, December 4, 1872.
                         
                         The House met and was called to order at nine o'clock a. m. by
                              the Speaker, and prayer was offered by the Rev. Dr. Day, pastor of the
                              First Baptist Church of this city.
                         On motion of Mr. BILLINGSLEY, the reading of the journal of yesterday
                              was dispensed with.
                         
                              REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                              Mr. OGDEN, from the Judiciary Committee,
                                   returned Mr. Wesner's bill [H. R. 147] regulating the
                                   rate of interest on the loan, or forbearance of money or things
                                   in action, and repealing, etc., recommending that it be
                                   indefinitely postponed.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              Mr. WILSON, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                   returned Mr. North's bill, [H. R. 139] regulating the
                                   expenses incurred by any county by a change of venue from another
                                   county, with amendments, inserting a rule for certifying such
                                   allowance to the county from which the cause was taken; for a
                                   declaration of emergency for immediate taking effect, etc.
                              The amendments were adopted, and so the bill was ordered to be
                                   engrossed for the third reading.
                              Mr. MILLER returned his bill [H. R. 115] to repeal the act
                                   regulating the sale of patent rights and prevent frauds in
                                   connection therewith, which took effect April 23, 1869,
                                   recommending its passage.
                              It was ordered to be engrossed.
                         
                         
                              MECHANICS' LIEN.
                              Mr. BUSKIRK returned Mr. Lenfesty's bill [H. R. 136] to
                                   amend section 654 of the practice act, recommending that it be
                                   indefinitely postponed.
                              Mr. LENFESTY hoped the report would not be concurred in, as it
                                   amended a section under that which held that where a mechanic
                                   does work on any building, or furnishes material for the
                                   construction or repair of any building, he shall have a lien
                                   thereon; even after the owner has paid up in full the original
                                   contractor, any workman under him may also file his lien. The
                                   amendment is, that where the sub-contractor files his lien, or
                                   gives notice of it to the owner, he shall be liable, but not for
                                   more than his contract with the original contractor. The present
                                   lien is an outrage. Taking this particular section of the
                                   practice act, and it would appear that the owner is not liable
                                   for more than is in his hands belonging to the original
                                   contractor; but according to the decision of the Supreme Court,
                                   the owner is liable to the sub-contractor, although he has paid
                                   the original contractor in full.
                              Mr. BUSKIRK said, in the opinion of a majority of the Judiciary
                                   Committee, the bill would discriminate against the interests of
                                   the poor laborers, and in favor of those better able to endure
                                   losses by the dishonesty of contractors, and therefore the
                                   committee thought it best to report adversely to the bill. They
                                   thought the owner of the building ought to assume the
                                   responsibility for such dishonesty of the contractor.
                              
                              Mr. BILLINGSLY opposed concurrence.
                              Mr. MILLER said that for the remedy of the hardships that might
                                   bear on the owner of the building it would be necessary to amend
                                   another section of the act, a section which is not the one
                                   proposed to be amended by this bill.
                              Mr. LENFESTY explained that it is proposed in this bill that when
                                   any workman is not being paid, then he may give the owner notice
                                   of his right, and, by giving proper notice from that time forth
                                   the owner becomes liable till the work is paid for.
                              Mr. JOHNSON thought the bill a good one, but it did not accomplish
                                   the object. The amendment was to the wrong section.
                              Mr. LENFESTY. It may be possible that I have got the wrong number
                                   of the section. I would like to have it recommitted for
                                   examination.
                              It was so ordered by unanimous consent.
                              Mr. JOHNSON, from the Judiciary Committee,
                                   returned Mr. Gregory's bill [H. R. 133] to repeal
                                   sections fifty-three and ninety-eight, and to amend section
                                   ninety-seven of the practice act of June 18, 1852, recommending
                                   indefinite postponement.
                              Mr. GREGORY would like to see the bill pass, and thought it might
                                   if the House had the time to consider it. It is a bill for the
                                   purpose of avoiding delays in the administration of justice, by
                                   restraining amendments on the trial; and it would to some extent
                                   cut off the practice of what are called constitutional lawyers.
                                   Under our too liberal statutes they can continue from time to
                                   time and compass the delays of justice.
                              The report was concurred in and the bill indefinitely
                                   postponed.
                         
                         
                              MEMORY OF MR. GREELEY.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN, from the special committee appointed under Mr.
                                   Hardesty's resolution of yesterday, submitted and read
                                   the following:
                              Mr. Speaker: The Select Committee appointed to take order on the
                                   occasion of the death of Horace Greeley, have instructed me to
                                   make the following report:
                              In connection with our fellow citizens, we deeply deplore the loss
                                   by death of so great and so good a man as Horace Greeley. The sad
                                   news has found its way, not only to every city, town and hamlet
                                   of his native continent, but on the globe, is only limited and
                                   confined by the bounds of civilization and intelligence. His life
                                   is not only a lesson but an example which commends itself to
                                   every aspiring mind in coming years, and is full of hope and
                                   promise. He commenced life poor and unknown, he left it rich and
                                   with a fame world wide. For thirty years he has occupied a
                                   prominent position before the American people, and that peculiar
                                   field of labor that invites criticism and censure. Yet during all
                                   those thirty years of journalistic pre-eminence, he has
                                   maintained a reputation unspotted and without reproach. No man of
                                   his time has impressed his peculiar views upon the institutions
                                   of the country more fully or completely than Horace Greeley.
                                   Nearly every principle advocated by him, no matter how unpopular
                                   at first, finally received the sanction of the people. And his
                                   devotion to principle regardless of popular feeling is the
                                   highest evidence of his honesty and worth. Many designing
                                   demagogues cling to dominent political parties for
                                   self-aggrandizement, but not so with Horace Greeley. His
                                   convictions of right and wrong determined his course, and he
                                   worshipped at the shrine of duty with an Eastern idolatry. He was
                                   the friend of the slave when friendship for him was a political
                                   crime. But regardless of self, he followed his conviction of
                                   right, and labored for his enfranchisement through good and
                                   through evil report, until at length he witnessed the full
                                   fruition of his labors in the complete triumph of his
                                   principles.
                              Horace Greeley is the first person who, after a lifetime spent in
                                   political strife and discord, in the short space of a political
                                   canvass, overcame the prejudices of his political opponents and
                                   received with great unanimity their indorsement and support. His
                                   death is a striking illustration of the uncertainty of human
                                   life. On the first of May last he was nominated by a respectable
                                   convention of his fellow citizens in Cincinnati for the highest
                                   office on earth. On the 12th of June last his nomination was
                                   indorsed and ratified by the Democratic party of the great State
                                   of Indiana, and on the 7th of July last was ratified and indorsed
                                   by the Democratic party of the nation in convention assembled at
                                   Baltimore, and on the 6th of November he was voted for by more
                                   than 2,000,000 of his fellow citizens for President of the United
                                   States, and on this day he was to be voted for by the chosen
                                   electors of the people for that high office, but instead thereof
                                   his mortal remains are to be committed to the cold and silent
                                   grave. In his death our country has lost a distinguished citizen,
                                   the world an accomplished man, science a follower, literature a
                                   friend, philosophy a star, and labor a devotee. In memory of such
                                   a man we might do many meaningless things. We might shroud this
                                   hall in black, and resolve to wear the feelingless crape. But we
                                   prefer to let each member in
                                   his own way manifest and express his respect and regret, and
                                   recommend the adoption of the following resolution:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, In respect for the
                                                  memory of Horace Greeley that this House do now
                                                  adjourn until to-morrow morning.
                                             JOHN E. RUMSEY,

                                   of said sum to the school fund, and distributed to the several
                                   counties.
                              
                              It was adopted.
                         
                         
                              GOVERNOR'S SALARY.
                              On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS the bill [S. 38] supplemental to the
                                   Governor's rent act ot February 25, 1865, confirming all
                                   sums of money paid to Governor Baker on account of rent, not
                                   exceeding $5,000 a year, was read the second time.
                              On his further motion the bill was read the third time and passed
                                   the Senate--yeas, 43; nays, 0.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS moved that his bill [S. 124] for an allowance of a
                                   $7,000 annual salary to the Governor be put upon its passage.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Accordingly the bill [S. 124] to define what shall be the salary of
                                   the Governor, the manner of paying the same, and declaring an
                                   emergency, was read the second time.
                              Mr. THOMPSON said that while the two preceding Governors had
                                   received about $8,000 per annum, the bill proposes to give the
                                   incoming Governor but $7,000. He bore testimony to the ability
                                   and good character of Governor Hendricks, and hoped that the bill
                                   would be amended so as to make the salary of the Governor
                                   $8,000.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE proposed an amendment to strike out $7,000 and insert
                                   $8,000.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved to amend further so as to provide that the
                                   salary shall be $8,000 a year, until an executive mansion shall
                                   be furnished by the State, and after that $5,000.
                              Mr. BEESON favored the amendment of Mr. Dittemore. He said he had
                                   been here for several years in association with the Governor,
                                   and, farmer as he was, he would not take the office for $8,000 a
                                   year.
                              Mr. HOUGH hoped Mr. Dittemore's amendment would not
                                   prevail. He hoped the time would never come when men would seek
                                   the Gubernatorial chair for the sake of the emoluments belonging
                                   to the office.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN said that the original bill came from the
                                   friends of the Governor elect, and if they were satisfied with
                                   $7,000 he didn't see the necessity for increasing
                                   it.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE accepted Mr. Dwiggins' amendment.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS said he did not offer the amendment as a partisan, but
                                   in order to make the salary of the Governor what it ought to be.
                                   No man of the ability of Governor Morton, or Governor Baker, or
                                   Governor Hendricks, could take the office at $8,000 a year,
                                   except at a pecuniary sacrifice.
                              Mr. THOMPSON has been the physician to every Governor of Indiana
                                   since Governor Whitcomb, and knew whereof he spoke when he
                                   averred that none of them have made any money out of the
                                   emoluments of the office.
                              On motion by Mr. STEELE, the amendment (Mr. Dwiggins') was
                                   laid on the table.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE renewed his amendment to strike out $7,000 and insert
                                   $8,000 in lieu.
                              The amendment was adopted, yeas 35, nays 9.
                              On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS, the bill was read the third time and
                                   passed, yeas 30, nays 9.
                              The Senate then adjourned until ten o'clock to-morrow
                                   morning.

                         HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                         
                              THURSDAY, December 5, 1872.
                         
                         The House met and was called to order by the Speaker at 9 a. m.
                         On the motion of Mr. LENFESTY the reading of the journal was dispensed
                              with.
                         Mr. BUTTERWORTH moved a call of House.
                         The motion was agreed to.
                         On the call seventy three members answered to their names, when, on
                              motion of Mr. Butterworth, further proceedings under the call were
                              dispensed with.
                         Mr. BILLINGSLEY asked and failed to obtain leave for the
                                   special committee on the Carroll county (Grimes)
                                   case to sit during the sesssion of the House
                         
                              REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                              Mr. KIMBALL, from the Ways and Means Committee,
                                   returned Mr, Wilson's, of Ripley, eight dollar mileage
                                   and per diem bill [H. R. 73] recommending reference to the
                                        Committe on Fees and Salaries.
                              The report was concurred in.
                         
                         
                              ASSESSMENT LAWS.
                              Mr. KIMBALL also reported, from the same committee, the matter in
                                   pamphlet print of a bill [H. R. 163] for an act to provide for a
                                   uniform assessment of property, and for the collection and return
                                   of taxes thereon.
                              On motion by Mr. BRANHAM it was read twice by title and referred
                                   again to the committee.
                         
                         
                              CLAIMS.
                              Mr. RIGGS, from the Committee on Claims,
                                   successively returned the claim of Stearns Fisher, for $52; of
                                   Julius Boetticher, for $465; of W. B. Baker, for Evening Mirror furnished; of J. G. Greenwalt, $1,500;
                                   of John Brownlee, $1,000; and Mr. Lenfesty returned the claim of
                                   the Indianapolis Commercial Company, for $78;
                                   of William B. Walters, $52; of the Guttenburg Co., $323 44, for
                                   newspapers furnished the House of Representatives, recommending
                                   the allowance thereof.
                              They were concurred in, and the same were referred to the Committee
                                   on Ways and Means, with instructions that they be placed in the
                                   specific appropriation bill.
                              Mr. COBB reported against the claim of J. C. Graham for $50, and
                                   the claim of Jeffersonville Railroad Company for $65 55.
                              It was concurred in.
                         
                         
                              CUSTODY OF THE PUBLIC MONEY.
                              Mr. MILLER, from the Committee on the Trust
                                   Fund, returned Mr. Woollen's bill [H. R. 24]
                                   to provide designated depositories for the safe keeping of the
                                   public money in the several counties, and prescribing penalties
                                   with an amendment giving power to the authorities to move such
                                   money when ihey deem fit. He said: The provisions of this bill
                                   have respect to the custody of all the public funds of the
                                   State.
                              Mr. BRANHAM was opposed to any change in the law for the care of
                                   public funds which contemplated their distribution among a number
                                   of depositories. The correct
                                   principle was to collect only sufficient revenue to secure a fair
                                   working balance in the Treasury, and that should be kept where
                                   the law now requires it to be kept--in vaults of the Treasury. He
                                   moved to lay the whole matter on the table, but withdrew his
                                   motion at the request of Mr. Woollen, who wished to say something
                                   in defense of the bill, as its author.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN said the present system of keeping the public funds was
                                   wrong. It is well known that the money is not kept in the vaults
                                   of the State Treasury, as required by law; but that on the
                                   contrary it is deposited in various banks, and the public
                                   officers are drawing and pocketing the Interest thereon. It is
                                   this fact which in a large measure causes the present stringency
                                   in money. In the neighborhood of $600,000 of the public funds is
                                   held by the banks on deposit, and during the session of the
                                   Legislature they are constantly fearful least they may be called
                                   upon to pay over these deposits. This operates to lock up a large
                                   amount of currency and cause stringency.
                              The object of this bill is to provide that when the money comes
                                   into the hands of the public treasurer it shall go from him into
                                   the hands of the depositories, guarded by law so that it shall be
                                   safe, and that the depositories shall give a fitting compensation
                                   for it, which proceeds shall go into the pockets of the
                                   sovereigns of the country who own it. The practical working of
                                   the present law is that the proceeds of this money go into the
                                   pockets of the publfc officers. I do not know how the law against
                                   it is avoided. But so it is; these proceeds go into the hands of
                                   the State officers to the extent of $30,000 or $40,000 annually.
                                   Then I say we ought to have some good practical law on this sub
                                   ject that will meet the exigencies of the times. I would not lay
                                   my hand on a dollar of this interest that has got into the hands
                                   of the public officers under the present law. It is theirs and
                                   they have a right to it. But, clearly, the interest accumulations
                                   of the public funds should belong to those who own the public
                                   funds. I hope the motion of the gentleman will not prevail; but
                                   that he will examine the bill, and, if he finds it a good thing,
                                   vote for it.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY said the present system of keeping county funds was one
                                   cause of the depreciation in value of county orders. County
                                   treasurers loaned the moneys to banks and pocketed the interest,
                                   while county orders went unpaid, because there were no funds in
                                   the treasury. He regarded it as a great outrage upon the people
                                   that public officers should bank upon the public funds.
                              Mr. COBB objected that the bill opened a loop hole for fraud by
                                   releasing sureties. The funds were now guarded loosely
                                   enough.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN explained that there was, under the provisions of the
                                   bill, no release of the sureties of the officers until after the
                                   bond of the depositaries had been filed.
                              Messrs. BUSKIRK and BUTTS also spoke in favor of the provisions of
                                   the bill.
                              The amendments reported by the committee were concurred in, the
                                   bill laid upon the table and 500 copies ordered to be
                                   printed.
                         
                         
                              REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                              Mr. COWGILL, from the Committee on Fees and
                                        Salaries, reported back Mr. Smith's bill
                                   [H. 45] to amend the act fixing the per diem of members and
                                   officers, with the recommendation that it be indefinitely
                                   postponed.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              Mr. BROADUS, from the same Commitee, reported back Mr.
                                   North's bill [H. 78], to amend the act providing for the
                                   erection of a State Prison north of the National road, with a
                                   recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              Mr. KING, from the Railroad Committee, returned
                                   Mr. Cowgill's bill [H. R. 144] to provide for the
                                   crossings of railroads, recommending its passage.
                              It was ordered to the engrossment.
                         
                         
                              COMMON SCHOOLS.
                              Mr. COFFMAN, from the Committiee on County and Township
                                        Business, returned Mr. Woollen's bill [H.
                                   R. 10] to provide for the issue and sale of bonds to raise money
                                   by the civil township for school house purposes, recommending its
                                   indefinite postponement.
                              Mr. MELLETT moved that the bill be referred to the
                                        Committee on Education.
                              The SPEAKER. The motion to indefinitely postpone has the
                                   precedence.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. The bill is just this: The cities and towns are
                                   authorized by law to issue bonds and borrow money for the purpose
                                   of building school houses, purchasing school grounds, etc., and
                                   some of them have gone beyond what they ought to have done, and
                                   abused their privileges; and this bill is simply to enable the
                                   townships to do what the towns and cities already have the right
                                   to do. I do not know why our fellow citizens in the townships in the country should not
                                   have the right to do what we do in the cities and towns. I know
                                   of many townships where they desire to do so. This simply
                                   provides that they may issue bonds to build school houses and pay
                                   for them. I do not know why one class of our people should be
                                   deprived of privileges accorded to other classes. I would rather,
                                   it seems to me (for it would be more safe generally), put this
                                   power into the hands of the farmers than into the hands of the
                                   people of the cities and towns.
                              Mr. GIVAN. This bill should not be summarily disposed of. The
                                   gentleman's explanation of it commends it to my respect.
                                   I hope the report will not be concurred in, and that it will go
                                   to the Committee on Education.
                              Mr. MELLETT concurred heartily in the remarks of Mr. Woollen, and
                                   indicated a motion to lay the report on the table.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY illustrated the working of the bill by mapping a
                                   township six miles square, and a little flock of a town in one
                                   corner erecting what they call a graded school with the township
                                   credit, whilst those living a mile and a half away would get no
                                   benefit from it. The proposition was to build school houses, but
                                   the object was to build up the towns. It would work great
                                   hardships. The best way was to provide for good district
                                   school-houses and schools so that the farmers can provide
                                   education for their children at home. And if the cities and towns
                                   want school houses let them have them at their own cost. In my
                                   town, after we had taxed our people in the country to build our
                                   school house, we paid them back their money--bought the school
                                   house.
                              Mr. BILLINGSLY was for the printing and reference of the bill. Many
                                   country school houses needed rebuilding, and they should be
                                   permanent structures.
                              Mr. CLAYPOOL. The committee came to the conclusion that the people
                                   of the districts ought to build to suit themselves. With the
                                   proposed power in the hands of the Trustees they would be apt to
                                   go too far, and we found that the bill authorizes them to borrow
                                   to the extent of 10 per cent. That would mortgage too much. I am
                                   satisfied that if the bill were left to my constituents they
                                   would object to it. I would be perfectly willing that the money
                                   shouId be raised under the present school law; and, if they
                                   desired it, they could raise the amount in a very short time.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. I provide in the bill that before the Trustees shall
                                   issue the bonds, they shall go before the County Commissioners
                                   and get the authority to do so.
                              Mr. MELLETT. The objection of the gentlemen from Morgan and Johnson
                                   can be raised on any public improvement, whatever. It will not do
                                   to take such considerations in reference to public education. I
                                   know there are difficulties about school houses--every man wants
                                   a school house at his own door. But this should not justify us in
                                   saying there shall not be a graded school in every township. It
                                   is better to have one if it is in the corner. The difficulty
                                   would not be increased by the passage of this bill. But now, if
                                   the trustee would build well, he must do ft by an evasion of the
                                   law. I would prefer he might have the power to build without
                                   evasions, and I think these evasions evince the wisdom of this
                                   proposition. This bill places it in the power of the trustee to
                                   provide suitable school houses in every district--overcoming the
                                   very objection which the gentleman raises. So far as the ten per
                                   cent. is concerned, I think that ought to be reduced.
                              Mr. RENO thought it better to increase the common school fund.
                              On motion of Mr. MELLETT, the report of the committee was laid on
                                   the table.
                              Mr. BILLINGSLEY moved to refer the bill to the Committee
                                        on Education.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN proposed to add these instructions: Provided, that
                                   before any bond shall be issued under this act, it shall be the
                                   duty of the board of county commissioners to procure the petition
                                   of two-thirds of the freeholders of the township; and that the
                                   committee strike out ten per cent. on the taxables and insert
                                   five per cent.
                              It was so ordered by consent, and then the bill was referred to the
                                        Committee on Education.
                         
                         
                              REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                              Mr. OGDEN, from the Committee on Corporations,
                                   returned Mr. King's bill [H. R. 39] to amend the second
                                   section of the act of February 12, 1855, concerning voluntary
                                   associations, with amendments by way of substitute, numbered [H.
                                   R. 163] for an act to amend the seventh section of the act of
                                   February, 1867, amenadtory of the act of 1855, concerning
                                   voluntary associations.
                              The report was concurred in, the original bill laid on the table,
                                   and the substitute passed to the secon reading.

                              Mr. LENFESTY, from the Committee on Federal
                                        Relations, returned the joint resolution in
                                   relation to the appropriation by Congress of two millions of dollars
                                   for surveys, etc., for improvement of navigation of the Ohio
                                   river, recommending its passage.
                              The resolution was adopted on the part of the House of

                                   indefinitely postponed.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              Mr. LENFESTY returned Mr. Kimball's bill [H. R. 6]

                                   the membership and officers, recommending its passage.
                              The amendments were adopted, and the bill ordered to be

                              STATE LIABILITY--OPPINION OF THE ATTORNEY
                                   GENERAL.
                              The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Attorney
                                   General, transmitting his opinion upon the points referred to in
                                   Mr. Gregory's resolution of inquiry touching the
                                   State's liability forthe payment of the unsurrendered
                                   canal bonds. The Attorney General is of the opinion that the
                                   State is clearly liable for the payment of these bonds, that the
                                   payment of Garrett's judgment will not increase her
                                   liability as to the other unsurrendered bonds, for the reason
                                   that the liability is already absolute, and that the State will
                                   become liable for the payment of the canal certificates should
                                   she permit the canal, its tolls and revenues to be sold in
                                   satisfaction of the Garrett judgment.
                              On the motion of Mr. GREGORY, the communication was laid upon the
                                   table and ordered to be printed.
                         
                         
                              GOVERNOR'S HOUSE RENT.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN, from, the Judiciary Committee, to
                                   whom had been referred the resolution introduced by Mr. Woollen,
                                   directing inquiry as to what legislation is necessary to enable
                                   the Governor to avail himself of the benefits of the act of
                                   February 25, 1865, granting an allowance in lieu of house rent,
                                   reported a bill [H. R. 164] providing for compensation at the
                                   rate of $5,000 per annum, from January 1, 1872, in lieu of house
                                   rent.
                              The bill was passed to its second reading.
                         
                         
                              THE GOVERNOR'S SALARY.
                              Mr. KIMBALL introduced a bill [H. R. 165] fixing the salary of the
                                   Governor at $8,000 per annum, and requiring him to provide his
                                   own house, the bill to take effect at the beginning of the term
                                   of the Governor elect.
                              It was passed to second reading.
                         
                         
                              INDIANAPOLIS POST OFFICE.
                              The bill [S. 56] granting consent of the State of Indiana to the
                                   purchase by the United States of certain grounds, not exceeding
                                   one acre, for the purpose of the erection of public buildings--a
                                   post office at Indianapolis was taken up, and under a suspension
                                   of the rules and ConstitutionaI restriction, passed the House
                                   without amendment--yeas, 92; nays, 0.
                              The Senate concurrent resolution providing for the printing of the
                                   report of the Deaf and Dumb Institute was taken up and
                                   passed.
                              Mr. MILLER submitted a resolution, which was adopted, directing
                                   chairmen of committees to report the number of clerks, etc.,
                                   employed by them, the number of hours per day that they are
                                   engaged, and an outline of their duties.
                              Mr. BILLINGSLEY renewed his request that the special
                                        committee on the Carroll county case investigation
                                   be permitted to sit during the sessions of the House,and it was
                                   so ordered.
                              
                              Mr. CAUTHORN introduced a bill [H. R. 167] for an act to preserve
                                   the original manuscripts of the journals of the Senate and
                                   House.
                              It was referred to the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary.
                              Mr. WALKER, a bill [H. R. 168] to amend section 11 of the act to
                                   establish the Court of Common Pleas (for concurrent jurisdiction
                                   with the Circuit Courts and the Justices of the Peace.)
                              It was referred to the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary.
                              Mr. BAXTER introduced a joint resolution confirming the site as
                                   already selected of the Indiana Reformatory Institute for women
                                   and girls.
                              The rules were suspended and the joint resolution passed.
                              The House then on motion of Mr. HELLER, took a recess till two
                                   o'clock, p. m.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The SPEAKER resumed the chair at two o'clock p. m., and
                                   pursued the orders of the day.
                              The bill [S. 8] to provide courts in the Twenty-fifth Common Pleas
                                   District was ordered to the third reading.
                         
                         
                              C. & O. R. R. TERMINUS AT MADISON.
                              Mr. Branham's border counties railroad aid bill [H. R. 70]
                                   was taken up and considered on the third reading.
                              Mr. BRANHA.M. There are probably but few counties in the State that
                                   are interested in the bill before the House, except the county of
                                   Jefferson. There is a railroad now being constructed, (the
                                   Cumberland and Ohio railroad) the northern terminus of which is
                                   at a point near Madison, which runs to Chattanooga, the railroad
                                   center of the South. The object of this bill is to enable the
                                   people of Madison to make this terminus opposite to them on the
                                   Ohio River. The advantage to Madison will be that it will place
                                   that city 100 miles nearer to Chattanooga. And I can say that our
                                   factories are sometimes almost suspended for want of shipping
                                   facilities. Our town is a manufacturing town, and there will be
                                   an outlet for us on this road. They have made an arrangement with
                                   that railroad company that if they raise a certain amount of aid
                                   they will make the terminus of their road opposite. If it is just
                                   that the people should tax themselves, there can be no objection
                                   to this bill. The bill has no other object; and if our people see
                                   proper to tax themseIves I do not think the balance of the State
                                   ought to object to it.
                              The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas 82,
                                   nays 1.
                              Mr. Walker's bill [H. R. 114] to amend the first section
                                   of the flouring mill race act of March 2, 1863, was taken up on
                                   the third reading.
                              Mr. WALKER. As the law now stands this right can not be given to a
                                   party unless he is desirous of erecting a mill. This bill, in
                                   addition, says he shall have the right where a mill is already
                                   erected.
                              The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas 81,
                                   nays 6.
                              Mr. WILSON of Ripley's bill [ H. R. 118] making the
                                   parties competent witnesses in certain cases involving contracts
                                   assigned to decedents, was taken up, and failed on the final
                                   reading--yeas 47, nays 38.
                         
                         
                              CRIMINAL PRACTICE.
                              Mr. JOHNSON'S bill [ H. R, 35] to amend section 90 of the
                                   criminal practice act--(to give the defendant's the
                                   right to testify)--was taken up on the third reading.
                              Mr. JOHNSON. This bill proposes to make an amendment to the
                                   criminal code so as to give the defendant in criminal actions the
                                   right to testify in his own behalf--or rather at his own request.
                                   I will say for information that this provision is copied almost
                                   verbatim from the N. Y. statutes. It accords to the defendant
                                   this right, so that the State can,t compel him to testify against
                                   himself; and so that he shall not be compelled to testify in his
                                   own behalf but he may if he chooses; and so, that if he chooses
                                   not to testify, the fact shall not be considered as a
                                   circumstance against him, and counsel shall not comment on his
                                   refusal or neglect to testify. It has not been long since parties
                                   in criminal actions were competent to testify. Since, however,
                                   the door has been opened, and parties in interest have been
                                   permitted to testify, it has been found that it ia beneficial.
                                   The jury or the court trying the case naturally desire all
                                   information they can get in regard to the facts. In erdinary
                                   transactions when we want information of a fact, we will go to
                                   the person who was present and ask him. And the Legislatures have
                                   found out that you can get the truth best from the person who
                                   knows most about it. Therefore parties in civil cases are allowed
                                   to testify against each other. That was considered an innovation,
                                   but it has proved a step taken in the direction of liberality and
                                   broader views; and it has been going on till in nearly all the
                                   States persons charged with crime are now permitted to testify in
                                   their own behalf. The hardship that rests upon him in having his
                                   lips sealed may be exemplified in this way, for instance: Last
                                   night a horse wras stolen from A, and to-day the horse is found
                                   in the possession of another person. Now the law is this: If A
                                   proves that he lost his horse and found it in the possession of
                                   the defendant, the burden of proof rests on the defendant. Now it
                                   might be that some thief stole the horse and sold it to the
                                   defendant, and so he goes to the penitentiary. I think that I
                                   know of one man who went to the penitentiary, and who might have
                                   escaped if he had been allowed to testify in his own behalf. I
                                   know it will be said that this rule will facilitate the escape of
                                   guilty men. I think not. The jury, if they choose not to believe
                                   the defendant, can reject his testimony. Standing in the relation
                                   of defendant, accused of crime, the jury will scan his story
                                   closely. If the defendant has interests, they ought to be
                                   regarded, and, if guilty, he will generally be convicted on the
                                   cross-examinations. There is the celebrated Clem case, wherein
                                   Nancy E. Clem, the defendant, was twice convicted. But every one
                                   knows that over that case there still hangs the secret of the
                                   murder; and that there is but one person that can dispel that
                                   secret--and that is the woman herself. This bill is to be
                                   followed by another. Originally, this bill had two parts: one to
                                   allow the defendant to testify, and the other to require the
                                   State to close the argument These two propositions are now
                                   separated. In this bill [H. R. 35] it is proposed to give the
                                   defendant the right to testify, and in the other, the bill [H. R.
                                   127], it is proposed that the State shall close the argument. In
                                   the one case, you open the way of escape for the innocent man; in
                                   the other, you shut off beyond a reasonable doubt the means of
                                   escape for the guilty.
                              The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas 61,

                              THE CALUMET DAM.
                              A message was received from the Senate announcing the passage of a
                                   concurrent resolution reciting the difficulties encountered in
                                   the attempt to procure the removal of the Calumet dam, and the
                                   great damage done to citizens of Lake and Porter counties by
                                   reason of the overflow of their lands consequent upon the
                                   existence of said dam, and directing the Attorney General to
                                   proceed at once to Chicago, or such other place as may be
                                   necessary to ascertain the exact ground upon which the injunction
                                   restraining the removal of the dam was procured, and take such
                                   steps as may be necessary to secure the removal of the
                                   nuisance.
                              A message was also received from the Senate announcing the passage
                                   by that body of House Bill No. 22, providing for the completion
                                   of unfinished business of one session by the next succeeding
                                   regular or special session.
                              The concurrent resolution of the Senate in relation to the Calumet
                                   dam, was taken up and concurred in.
                         
                         
                              CRIMINAL PRACTICE--CLOSING ARGUMENT.
                              The SPEAKER announced the consid eration on the third reading of
                                   Mr. Johnson's bill [H. R. 137] to amend section of the
                                   criminal practice and procedure of June 17, 1852.
                              Mr. JOHNSON. I have said almost nll that I care to on this bill. It
                                   is simply a verbatim copy of the provision in regard to the
                                   opening and closing arguments in civil cases. It has long been a
                                   cardinal rule in the discussion of all questions, both in
                                   legislative bodies and before the courts, that the side of the
                                   question upon whom rests the burden of the issue shall have the
                                   opening and the closing of the argument, It has always been so at
                                   common law. It is so in criminal as well as in civil practice at
                                   common law, It is so in every civilized country in the worldit is
                                   so in every State of the Union except the State of Indiana.
                                   Indiana is the only State in the Union where the negative side is
                                   compelled to close the argument; and I think this rule in our
                                   practice has been recently denounced by one of the Judges as a
                                   barbarous rule. Now, the defendant has safeguards enough around
                                   him. In the first place he is presumed to be innocent till the
                                   contrary is proved. In the next place, the jury must be convinced
                                   beyond a reasonable doubt of his guilt. Now, not ten minutes
                                   since, the House has voted for a bill giving the defendant the
                                   right to testify in his own behalf. And with all these things in
                                   the defendant's favor, shall we continue to make this
                                   State an exception to the civilized world? In the United States
                                   Courts the government has the opening and closing argument--and
                                   in every State in the Union except Indiana. I might say that this
                                   rule in our State was gotten up originally by the criminal
                                   lawvers in behalf of what they know gjves them a successful
                                   practice. We have just given the right to testify to the
                                   defendant; that cuts off all probability of the penitentiary for
                                   an innocent man. Now, let us pass this bill, and close the way of
                                   escape for the guilty.
                              Mr. BUSKIRK. I desire to say a word before this bill passes. I was
                                   in favor of the last bill we passed; but I am earnestly opposed to this; and I do
                                   not admit the argument in favor of this bill, because the other
                                   has or may become the law. The only view that has been taken of
                                   this important innovation on our system of practice is this: that
                                   the party closing the argument has the advantage. Now, the
                                   question is, where ought the advantage to be given? Ought it to
                                   be with the State or with the person accused? I believe that the
                                   theory of our criminal law accords the principle that all
                                   presumptions are to be in favor of the criminal. This is sound in
                                   theory and safe in practice. I believe that it is safer that
                                   ninety-nine of the guilty should escape than that one innocent
                                   person should be punished. The gentleman says that in Indiana
                                   alone the defendant has the closing argument. I believe that our
                                   Constitutional Convention of 1850-51, did a great many things of
                                   which they may be justly proud, and I believe that this provision
                                   is one of the wisest things which they recordeed to their honor.
                                   By the common law the State has the closing argument. But we may
                                   find many other unjust things in the common law of England; as
                                   that the defendant is not entitled to counsel. These things are
                                   eminently unjust. I believe that if we look over the criminal
                                   annals of Indiana, and compare them with those of other States,
                                   we will not find anything in which she will appear to any
                                   disadvantage. The right of the defendant to testify is not in
                                   point here. This is simply a question as to who shall have the
                                   closing argument; and if there is any advantage in this, I
                                   believe in giving it to the criminal.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. I am only going to say a few words. It is time as the
                                   gentleman says, that the common law has grown up in this country,
                                   and we have taken what we favored--sometimes at the expense of
                                   the many. But we know that laws are made slowly and singly, for
                                   the purpose of curing some evil. But the intention of the bill is
                                   this: It is intended for the more effectual enforcement of the
                                   criminal laws of the State. They have hardly ever been rigorously
                                   enforced. We have been for sometime going back from the
                                   enforcement of the criminal laws. Now, the evil to be remedied is
                                   to prevent the escape of the criminal not to prevent the
                                   conviction of the innocent man. This Legislature has not been
                                   called upon to legislate for the purpose of saving the innocent
                                   from the penitentiary, but to bring the guilty to punishment.
                                   And, if gentlemen here will go home and inquire what has been
                                   most talked about by the people, they will find that it is this
                                   very thing--that our criminal laws have not been sufficiently
                                   enforced. Now the eulogy which the gentleman passed upon the
                                   Constitutional Convention of 1851 might be well enough deserved
                                   by that body; but I conceive that his mention of it is but
                                   moonshine, because prior to 1850 there was no complaint about the
                                   criminal laws: but the evil complained of has grown up since the
                                   law we are now seeking to repeal was placed on the statute books.
                                   Again, if the gentleman will go back prior to the Convention of
                                   1850, he will find no beech trees ornamented with criminals. The
                                   beech tree came into favor as a part of the law we are seeking to
                                   repeal. It was since the State stepped back from the right to the
                                   closing argument that it has come to pass that justice must be
                                   enforced by vigilance committees. I say this law stands in the
                                   way of the administration of justice. Sympathy always goes out in
                                   favor of the criminal. And hence, if you permit the
                                   defendants' counsel to close--especially since we have
                                   such prosecuting attorneys as are commonly elected--the State
                                   stands but little chance in the case, and unless we prevent the
                                   stronger counsel from closing the argument on the part of the
                                   accused, no jury can convict. Now, let us make the law logical.
                                   Let us give the close of pleadings to the party that has the
                                   burden of proof, for he must make out the case beyond a doubt.
                                   Let us reserve to the State the right of the sovereign to close
                                   and say through her attorney the last word in the case.
                              Mr. WALKER. I think the law as it now stands is obviously
                                   indefensible by any gentleman in the State of Indiana, and that
                                   it will be attempted by none outside of the General Assembly,
                                   except, it may be, by some of our able criminal lawyers. I
                                   believe that it is the united voice of the people of Indiana that
                                   the defendant should be denied the closing argument in criminal
                                   cases. I believe that nothing can make that just which is unjust.
                                   I invite every gentleman to vote against the lawyers. I concur
                                   wdth the gentleman [Mr. Woollen] that nothing has contributed so
                                   much to encourage mob law in the State as this rule which we are
                                   seeking to repeal. Our criminal laws are loosely made--made at
                                   the bidding of a maudling liberality. The salaries paid to the
                                   prosecutors are so low that the able lawyer will not accept the
                                   office, and the result is that we have young men for prosecutors.
                                   Now comes to the assistance of the defendant his counsel--the
                                   ablest lawyers of the State--and do not lose sight of the fact
                                   that the defendant must be
                                   proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt--that no doubt must
                                   linger in the minds of the jury, and the jury must judge of the
                                   law and the facts, and still the able counsel have the closing
                                   word. We must not forget the ability of the defendant's
                                   counsel--men who have looked into the faces of hundreds of
                                   jurymen--they have proficiency in determining the faces of men,
                                   and the last argument of counsel has acquitted three-fourths of
                                   the criminals on trial in Indiana for the last ten years. It is
                                   so. There is no doubt of the fact, that more depends on the
                                   closing argument than on everything else for the
                                   criminal's acquittal. Now I can set up no claim for the
                                   wisdom of Indiana legislation above that of the civilized world.
                                   And I will repeat that this act for a rule in pleadings had its
                                   birth in the mendacity of criminal lawyers, and in an un guarded
                                   moment it was crystalized into law. This is not an aggressive
                                   step. It invites the dust of the old shelves of the law to settle
                                   down again on our statute books. I believe that this act will
                                   pass without a dissenting voice; and that it will receive the
                                   sanction of the law-abiding people of Indiana.
                              Mr. ANDERSON. If it is to be set down as a fact that juries are
                                   almost universally influenced by the last argument, I
                                   can't see how a just act should award the last argument
                                   to the criminal. I am not aware of the fact that the State of
                                   Indiana has gained any notoriety for looseness in her criminal
                                   trials; neither do I think she lingers behind other States in
                                   regard to a fair enforcement of the administration of justice.
                                   And although the last argument may have more influence on the
                                   jury, still I think justice should accord the close to the
                                   criminal. If the reasoning of gentlemen is good, then to give the
                                   last argument to the criminal is an important advantage; and
                                   therefore I shall certainly feel it to be my duty to vote against
                                   this bill.
                              Mr. WALKER. I have always been in favor of giving the criminal a
                                   fair trial; but, while I believe this, I believe that we should
                                   also be just to the people of the State. This innovation of 1850
                                   has proved to be unwise; and I trust we will pass this bill. We
                                   have given the defendant the right to testify in his own case:
                                   and now if we should defeat this bill, we will leave the matter
                                   in an awkward position.
                              Mr. BUSKIRK. It was said by the gentleman last on the floor, that
                                   the mendacious propose opposition to this bill. My opposition to
                                   the bill is not so founded; but it is founded in what I conceive
                                   to be unjust in the bill itself. I have in my mind a criminal
                                   case now pending in the Circuit Court of my own county. A man by
                                   the name of Davis is charged murder. I am employed to assist in
                                   the prosecution of the case. There is also employed a certain
                                   lawyer in Evansville, who ranks, perhaps, foremost amongst the
                                   lawyers of that part of the State, and in that case I believe, if
                                   the State have the closing argument, it being a case made up on
                                   circumstantial evidence, and where the legal skill will be
                                   balanced about equally, the defendant will stand a chance to be
                                   found guilty, whether in fact he is guilty or not. I understand
                                   that the gentleman from Wayne predicates his argument on the fact
                                   that in our criminal cases the State is always represented by
                                   poor lawyers, and the defendant by able ones. Now I say that
                                   argument does not lie in the mouth of the State. But that is the
                                   main argument of the gentleman, together with this: that upon the
                                   closing argument depends, for the most part, the verdict in tihe
                                   case. Now, I agree with the gentleman from Cass (Mr. Anderson),
                                   if that proposition is true, that upon the closing argument
                                   depends the result, then the closing argument ought to be with
                                   the defendant. If there is any difference, any advantage in the
                                   case, it should be in favor of the defendant. The gentleman from
                                   Johnson (Mr. Woollen) says if the bill pass we shall have no more
                                   mob law. That is a rash assertion, to say the least; because mob
                                   law has existed as long as the civil law.
                              Mr. JOHNSON. I have the affirmative and ought to have the close. I
                                   have a word in answer to the gentleman from Gibson (Mr Buskirk).
                                   If my friend from Gibson is afraid that the defendant he spoke of
                                   will be convicted if the State has the close, he certainly ought
                                   to resign his employment in the case. [Laughter.] But, if he is
                                   convinced that the defendant is innocent, I will venture the
                                   assertion that, with all his eloquence, his closing speech will
                                   not convict him. But then, after the argument is all closed the
                                   court instructs the jury; and in almost every criminal case, the
                                   law is so favorable to the defendant, that the instructions of
                                   the court amount to an argument for the criminal. The law is so
                                   lenient, and the judge is so careful and merciful, that if
                                   injustice has been done by the counsel for the State, it will be
                                   corrected in the instructions of any upright court. The criminal
                                   will be in no danger; because the law makes the charge of the court almost an argument
                                   for the criminal. While the gentleman from Gibson stands here in
                                   favor of the criminal, I stand up in favor of nobler clients. I
                                   stand in favor of the protection of the State and of society.
                                   Society is now in more jeopardy than any man can be. And now, in
                                   the present stage of our public morals--since the gibbet and
                                   lynching post has come into office to take the place of
                                   justice--I am inclined to take the side of society, and erect a
                                   barrier against crime; and I am prepared to say that it may,
                                   after all, be better for society that one innocent man should
                                   suffer, than that ninety-nine guilty should escape.
                              The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives; yeas, 75;
                                   nays, 15.

                              The SPEAKER resumed the call of the House by counties and districts

                              Mr. BOWSER submitted a resolution directing the Committee

                                   vs. Taylor.

                         The reading of the Secretary's minutes of yesterday's
                              proceedings was dispensed with.
                         
                              PETITIONS.
                              Mr. BIRD presented a petition from about 200 citizens and tax-
                                   payers of Allen county, interested in the maintainance of the
                                   Wabash and Erie Canal, and praying that it may not be abandoned,
                                   but that a law may be passed authorizing the Commissioners of
                                   counties through which the canal passes, to make appropriations
                                   for repairs, etc. The signers were principally business men.
                              Mr. HUBRARD, from citizens of St. Joseph county, praying for the
                                   repeal of the drainage laws.
                              These petitions were referred to the Appropriate Committees.
                         
                         
                              REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS, from the Committee on Corporations
                                   returned the bill [S. 56] to amend sections 22 and 57 of the town
                                   incorporation act of June 11, 1852, and the amending act of March
                                   2, 1855, recommending its passage with sundry amendments. The
                                   bill authorizes the collection of license fees by towns for the
                                   keeping of billiard tables and the sale of intoxicating
                                   liquors.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              Mr. HUBBARD, from the same committee, returned the levee and drain
                                   bill [S. 43] recommending that it lie on the table.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              Also the bill [S. 73] with amendments. The bill proposes to make
                                   town marshals elective by the town trustees instead of at a
                                   general election.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              Mr. THOMPSON, from the Committee on Benevolent
                                        Institutions, returned the bill [S. 97]
                                   appropriating $20,000 for an experimental school for feeble
                                   minded children, reporting it inexpedient at this time, and
                                   recommending that the bill lie on the table.
                              Mr. COLLETT moved to recommit it, with instructions to report the
                                   bill back with a recommendation that a small amount of money
                                   $4,000 or $5,000 be appropriated to start an institution of this
                                   kind.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. STEELE, from the Committee on the Organization of
                                        Courts, recommending the passage of the bill [S.
                                   77] to amend section 476 of the general practice act.
                              The report was concurred in.
                         
                         
                              WABASH AND ERIE CANAL.
                              The special order for this hour was taken up, being Mr.
                                   Steele's bill [S. 85] to protect the Wabash and Erie
                                   Canal, and the tolls and revenues thereof, from sale or
                                   sequestration for the satisfaction of the lien of certain bonds
                                   or stocks of the State, issued prior to the transfer of said
                                   canal to the present Board of Trustees thereof, and to provide
                                   for the satisfaction of said bonds or stocks, on its second
                                   reading.
                              
                              Mr. BROWN moved to amend by striking out from the first section of
                                   the bill the words: "Protect said canal by taking up and
                                   redeeming the bonds," and insert in lieu the words,
                                   "take up and redeem said bonds," so that it
                                   shall read:
                              SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the
                                        General Assembly of the State of Indiana, That the
                                   Governor, Attorney General and Secretary of State and Treasurer
                                   of State, or a majority of them, be, and they are hereby
                                   authorized and empowered to tske up and redeem said bonds with
                                   the coupons thereto belonging, mentioned in or contemplated by
                                   the preamble to this act and for that purpose a sum of money
                                   sufficient to accomplish the object, is hereby appropriated,
                                   etc.
                              Mr. BROWN said if the bill shall pass it should not recognize any
                                   liabilty on the part of the State to protect the canal. If the
                                   bonds are to be paid at all, it should be as though no suit had
                                   been commenced, and as though no person had made a demand for
                                   pay, but as though the State had come forward and paid them of
                                   her own volition. There should be no section in the bill
                                   permitting the State to be brought into Court at all. A State
                                   should not go into court to put her rights in jeopardy, but for
                                   the purpose only of asserting her rights.
                              Mr. STEELE accepted the amendment and it was agreed to.
                              Mr. BROWN moved to amend by striking out the fourth section of the
                                   bill, which reads as follows:
                              SECTION 4. If any question should arise as to
                                   the validity of any bond contemplated by this act, or as to the
                                   amount due on any of the bonds or coupons contemplated by this
                                   act, or any other point or question which is, or may be involved
                                   in said suit now pending in said Cass Circuit Court, which, in
                                   the Judgment of the Attorney General ought to be litigated, that
                                   officer may, with the advice and consent of the Governor,
                                   Secretary of State and Treasurer of State, or a majority of them,
                                   cause the State to be made a party to said action now pending as
                                   aforesaid, for the sole purpose of asserting the right of the
                                   State to redeem said canal and its appurtenances from the
                                   operation of the lien of said bonds and coupons, by paying the
                                   amount which may be legally and justly due thereon, and the State
                                   after being made a party to said action, shall have the right to
                                   make any defence which the trustees of said canal might or would
                                   do; but under no circumstances shall any court, because of the
                                   State having become a party to said action, have or assume
                                   jurisdiction to render any Judgment against the State for any
                                   amount, or under any pretence whatever.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. BROWN moved to further amend by striking out the fifth and
                                   sixth sections of the bill, which read as follows:
                              SECTION 5. The State after having been made a
                                   party to said suit, shall have the same right of appeal that the
                                   trustees of said canal may or might exercise, and if the Attorney
                                   General shall, with the advice and consent of the Governor,
                                   Secretary of State and Treasurer of State, or a majority of them,
                                   determine to appeal from any judgment that may be rendered in
                                   said cause, then it shall be the duty of the trustees of said
                                   canal to join in such appeal, and the Governor, Attorney General,
                                   Secretary of State and Treasurer of State shall procure the
                                   necessary sureties to become bound, in the proper appeal bond,
                                   such bond to be executed by the Governor for and on behalf of the
                                   State, and the State hereby pledges herself to indemnify and save
                                   harmless those who may become sureties in such appeal bond, from
                                   all loss, costs or trouble by reason of such suretyship.
                              SECTION 6. If from any cause the State should
                                   fail in being admitted to become a party to said action for the
                                   purposes aforesaid, it shall be lawful for the Attorney General,
                                   with the advice and consent of the officers aforesaid, to file a
                                   new complaint and commence anew action in said Cass Circuit Court
                                   for the purpose of redeeming said canal and its appurtenances
                                   from the operation and effect of said lien by paying such sum or
                                   sums of money as may be legally payable on the bonds and coupons
                                   which constitute the lien, making the said Garrett and other.
                                   holders of said bonds defendants to said action, and making such
                                   other defendants thereto as the Attorney General may deem
                                   necessary and proper, and the Attorney General in such new action
                                   shall apply to the court for such injunctions and restraining
                                   orders against said John W. Garrett and his co-plaintiffs as may
                                   be necessary to restrain and enjoin proceedings in the said
                                   action now pending as aforesaid, until the rights of the State
                                   can be fully and fairly adjudicated.
                              This motion to strike out was also agreed to.
                              Mr. BROWN moved to strike out the preamble which referred to the
                                   Garrett suit, and provided that the State should be made a party
                                   to the suit, and for an appeal of the case.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. BROWN then moved to substitute therefor the following:
                              WHEREAS, There are still outstanding 191 of the
                                   old bonds or certificates of the State stock issued by and under
                                   the authority of the laws of this State prior to the year 1841,
                                   upon some of which no interest has been paid since January, 1841,
                                   and upon others of which the interest has been settled up to
                                   July, 1868. Therefore."
                              Mr. STEELE consenting, it was agreed to by the Senate.
                              Mr. HARNEY said, in 1860, when a member of the Legislature, he
                                   examined the character of the act under which the arrangements
                                   were made with the State's creditors. The General
                                   Government held certain old bonds of the State in trust for
                                   certain Indian tribes, and refused to pay to the State the three
                                   per cent. bonds due us until we paid up these bonds the
                                   Government held in trust. It was the duty of the State to satisfy
                                   the General Government, and the arrangement made was just and
                                   proper as the General Government stood in a different position
                                   from our other creditors. It had been a beneficiary to the extent
                                   of donating the bonds that stood almost as the only basis of that
                                   great improvement, and it looked hard that we should refuse to
                                   pay the interest on the bonds it held only in trust for othere,
                                   and the question has since continually recurred as to whether the
                                   arrangement made with the Federal Government was just, that it
                                   was based on sound and correct principles.
                              
                              The bonds in dispute contain these words: "For the payment
                                   of which the faith of the State is irrevocably pledged."
                                   This is the language of sovereignty, the language of treaties,
                                   and, by implication, the language of every statute. The State, in
                                   her sovereign capacity as the fountain of law and justice, must
                                   be the only and final arbiter of what her plighted faith demands
                                   of her. This power she may not delegate, nor commit so sacred and
                                   vital a trust to any tribunal less responsible and competent to
                                   decide than the State itself, speaking through its constituted
                                   organs to express its sovereign will.
                              As between parties subject to its laws, the State, in its
                                   constitution, says it shall make no law impairing the obligation
                                   of contracts, but as between itself and another party no
                                   deliberate act of the State can be construed as violating a
                                   contract, because the State itself is the arbiter and so declares
                                   it in the contract, and therefore her ruling must be taken as
                                   conclusive as that of any court to which the law gives the power
                                   of ultimately deciding questions submitted to it. Any other
                                   construction would put the State in the power of a creature of
                                   its own construction, and would give the courts, its creatures,
                                   power to decide upon its duties and its franchises, or treat it
                                   like any corporation over which the court held control.
                              But while we claim for the State these high prerogatives, without
                                   which it could no exist as a State, we admit that she is amenable
                                   to that code of public law recognized by all States and
                                   sovereignties in the civilized world, binding upon the State as
                                   upon the conscience of individuals, and this is the law which the
                                   State takes notice of when deciding between hersef and
                                   individuals.
                              Individuals dealing with a State must know these facts, for they
                                   are written in the bond; and when the State decides that she has
                                   complied with her plighted faith, they must accept her decision
                                   as final and conclusive.
                              The question then is, has the State in good conscience discharged
                                   her obligation to her creditors, or the private parties
                                   contracting with her in the matter of these bonds?
                              We must first premise that the contract must be taken within the
                                   rules of interpretation known and accepted at the time it was
                                   made, and not as being absolute according to the letter. Mankind
                                   has long since decided that all the duties and obligations which
                                   the party was known to be under at the time he secured the
                                   confidence of his creditor must be taken into the account, as the
                                   State could not destroy itself or tax its subjects beyond their
                                   ability to pay the demands of a creditor.
                              Its only resources are known to be taxation--and that taxation is
                                   limited by the ability of the subject to pay in all good
                                   conscience.
                              The same rule holds good with individuals. The right of food and
                                   clothing for himself and family, and some means to educate his
                                   children, is paramount to the claims of any creditors, and a
                                   Shylock can no longer enforce his bond for the pound of
                                   flesh.
                              At the time those bonds of the State were given the surroundings
                                   were peculiar. The State was young and over sanguine. It was at a
                                   time of great expansion in money affairs. Money was plenty and
                                   capitalists were eager to invest in public enterprises that
                                   promised any degree of security. Loans were taken with a reckless
                                   prodigality, and the means were squandered in unproductive
                                   improvement. This speculative period, characterized by rash
                                   borrowing, and still more reckless loanings, was succeeded by the
                                   darkest period in our financial history. Money was not to be had.
                                   The business of the country was largely carried on by barter and
                                   exchange. All the schemes and speculations and corporations made
                                   to carry them out failed. Collection of debts was restricted or
                                   suspended, and stay laws, valuation and exemption laws passed.
                                   These attest the terrible stringency in money affairs. Then the
                                   bankrupt law was passed by Congress, which swept away a large
                                   amount of indebtedness at once, and reduced the ability of their
                                   creditors to pay.
                              There was nothing feigned in the inability of the State to pay
                                   interest on her debt She failed from sheer inability. The
                                   necessary taxes, when placed on the duplicate, could not be
                                   collected. Especially in the Western States commerce and
                                   manufactures were utterly paralyzed. The financial seas were
                                   stripped of ships, and their shores were strewn with wrecks.
                              Gentlemen whose memories do not go so far back as that period can
                                   have some faint conception of the state of affairs by drawing
                                   upon their imagination and figuring what would be the result,
                                   suppose that within a few months the value of our currency should
                                   depreciate and it should die on our hands, and gold should be
                                   demanded in its place, and there were no mines in our borders
                                   from which we could dig the precious metal--suppose all our
                                   railroads were destroyed and the telegraph ceased to work. With
                                   all of these supposed disasters we can then only have approximate idea of the condition
                                   of affairs in this State from 1841 to 1847. The State was totally
                                   unable to pay, and her creditors knew it.
                              We can well sympatize with the condition of our creditors, but they
                                   were no worse off than others: and the result proved they were in
                                   a far better condition than the great mass of creditors in the
                                   land, the most of whom lost all and had no remedy. It partook
                                   much of the character of a revolution, and after the fiercest of
                                   the storm was over, by common consent there was a general new
                                   adjustment of debts, formed on the basis of affairs then
                                   existing, that all appreciated and acknowledged. The State was
                                   first challenged by her creditors to make a new arrangement with
                                   them. Although the interest had not been paid for years, she had
                                   not been accused of violating her plighted faith. She was unable
                                   to pay, and there seemed but an indefinite prospect that she
                                   would pay the accumulating interest that was compounding upon
                                   her.
                              The State responded and by law made a new arrangement, drawn up by
                                   her creditors themselves and adverse to her, and the bill bears
                                   to-day the name of the agent of her creditors. "The
                                   Butler Bill," by enactment, became a law upon our
                                   statute book--as much so as the law authorizing the creation of
                                   the debt. It was made to redeem the plighted faith of the State
                                   in the original bond, sealed and doubly authenticated by common
                                   consent at the time, and it has been defended by many of the best
                                   and purest men from then until now.
                              But it is said that the Butler Bill was a new contract setting
                                   aside the old, and therefore parties to the old not being present
                                   and assenting were not bound by the new. This would have been the
                                   case with individuals, but in this case one party is a State--her
                                   official acts are public, and all parties affected must take
                                   notice without special service. The bondholder, situated like Mr.
                                   Garrett, must have known of the proposed sale of the canal. They
                                   stood by and without protest suffered the State to sell the
                                   canal, making provision for what equitable interest they had in
                                   the canal by virtue of any lien they had. Their own silence to a
                                   public act would imply a binding consent. But suppose they had
                                   protested against the passage of the bill, or had no legal
                                   knowledge of any action in the premises, they only occupied the
                                   position of some minority under the operation of almost every law
                                   passed. The State is under no higher obligation to her creditor
                                   than to her own subjects. The minority are made to suffer same
                                   real or imagined loss or ill convenience, that the public good
                                   may be subserved. In the adjustment of her public debt the State
                                   aimed to and did perform substantial justice to her own citizens
                                   and to her creditors, treating them all alike.
                              But, again, it is said the State is now able to pay these bonds
                                   outstanding, and therefore she should not plead the act of 1847.
                                   This argument comes with a poor grace from parties who repudiate
                                   the act by which she was enabled to overcome her embarrassment
                                   and finally establish her solvency. If there is any special
                                   courtesy or partiality is it not in favor of the parties who
                                   cheerfully accepted the position and assisted to sustain our
                                   credit? If all our creditors had shown the same disposition as
                                   these there is no telling to-day what might have been our
                                   financial condition.
                              The simple question now is was the adjustment acts of 1846-47
                                   binding and operating upon all affected by it? We must take it
                                   all or reject it all. The whole of it was intended for one
                                   purpose. If in that pupose it failed the whole of it was a
                                   failure. If the law was unconstitutional, inoperative, or void as
                                   to these bonds contemplated in this bill, were not other parties
                                   injured aggrieved who were made to believe that the State meant
                                   what she said when she declared year after year that she would
                                   never make any other arrangement with her creditors than the one
                                   declared by law to be her ultimatum?
                              Suppose that the Legislature at any time while the funding of the
                                   old State debt was going on had said that creditors who refused
                                   to accede to the arrangement should finally be paid in full,
                                   principal and compound interest, but few would have ever accepted
                                   of the terms offered, and to-day most of the partes holding canal
                                   stock would have been holding the old bonds against us. Can we
                                   say now that during time the State was merely using brute force
                                   to force or drive her creditors into acquiescence with her plans,
                                   and that in after times she intended to withdraw her threats and
                                   pay in full those who refused to put confidence in her repeated
                                   assertions?
                              For my part, as one of the representatives of the people of this
                                   State, whose sentiments I knew and represented, I have often
                                   asserted to our creditors that the provisions of that Butler bill
                                   was a finality, and I can not go back upon that record now
                                   without stultifying myself and my constituency.
                              
                              I must still maintain that the adjustment bill of 1846 and 1847 was
                                   framed in justice and equity; that in it there was no violation
                                   of contract, that in the spirit of the act the State redeemed her
                                   plighted faith and all that the most exacting judge could have
                                   demanded of her. She surrendered all her property and consented
                                   to tax her people all they were able then to bear. The act was
                                   public and authoritative, and her faith was pledged to its
                                   observance as much as it was in the act authorizing the debt.
                              But the case now before us has new complications, differing from
                                   any presented before. Two parties, both State creditors, and
                                   therefore both adverse in interest to the State, are at law over
                                   property once owned and ceded by the State, and by a species of
                                   logic new and peculiar, worthy of the school of the Sorbonnie
                                   which Pascal so aptly delineated, it is now made to appear that
                                   in any event of that suitthe State is liable for claims and
                                   demands which have been adjusted by the State twenty-five years
                                   ago.
                              If the controversy referred to in the bill before us is between two
                                   parties, and the result cannot affect the State, why bring it
                                   before us and make their acts a subject of legislation? If the
                                   decision of the court affects the rights or interests of the
                                   State why is she not made a party to the suit? If by reason of
                                   her sovereignty she cannot be made a party, how can the suit be
                                   brought and the State be made to suffer where she cannot appear?
                                   If the the solemn acts of the State founded in justice and
                                   directed to the public good and sustained by courts and people
                                   for twenty pears can be nullified or set aside by the decision of
                                   a Circuit Judge upon a collateral issue where the State is not a
                                   party, who is to be the custodian of the public faith and why may
                                   not the State be made to answer in every court of the State in
                                   civil suit and abide the decision of the court, and thus become a
                                   subject of the administration of justice rather than its
                                   administrator?
                              Mr. HARNEY spoke at greater length on the subject, and when he
                                   concluded, the motion [Mr. Steele's] that the bill be

                              Pending the roll call--
                              Mr. ROSEBRUGH, in explanation of his vote said: This question is
                                   one that has puzzled almost every person that has attempted to
                                   look into it. It was not in a condition he would like to see it,
                                   although his views were somewhat changed since the original
                                   question came before the Legislature. His vote was based upon the
                                   ground that the State owed a debt that the public works were
                                   pledged to protect, and inasmuch as the public works cannot
                                   discharge the debt the faith of the State is pledged to discharge
                                   it: therefore, he voted in favor of the engrossment of the
                                   bill.
                              The vote was then announced as above recorded,
                              So the bill was ordered to be engrossed.
                              On motion of Mr. STEELE, the bill was read the third time, and put
                                   upon its passage.
                              Mr. STEELE then took the floor and commenced an argument in favor
                                   of the passage of the bill. Before he had concluded, he gave way
                                   for a motion to adjourn.
                              And then the Senate took a recess till two o'clock
                                   p.m.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              Mr. STEELE resumed the floor, and continued his remarks in favor of
                                   the immediate passage of his bill. He contended that the State is
                                   bound to pay these bonds as they fall due, or else we are bound
                                   to submit ourselves to the charge of having broken our
                                   contract.
                              He argued that it was never the intention to cut off the rights of
                                   those who failed to surrender their bonds. The eighth section of
                                   the act itself recites that "a large portion of the
                                   bondholders" had signified a desire to compromise, thus
                                   recognizing the fact that the desire was not unanimous.
                              As to the certificates held by those who surrendered their bonds,
                                   he held that no liability could arise on the part of the State
                                   for their payment. By the Butler compromise two kinds of
                                   certificates were issued, one payable by taxation and the other
                                   to be liquidated by the transfer to the holders of the canal, its
                                   lands, tolls, and revenues. Those belonging to the first class
                                   have already been paid, and those belonging to the second class
                                   were provided for as indicated. The entire liability of the State
                                   upon the surrendered bonds, then, has been discharged, and the
                                   holders of the certificates can have no  claim against the State as long as
                                   the canal and its tolls and revenues are secured to them
                                   according to the provisions of the bill.
                              The act itself recognizes a difference between the status of those
                                   who surrendered their bonds and received certificates therefor
                                   and those who retained them.
                              A priority of payment was given to the bonds of the latter. After a
                                   certain date other bondholders could indeed come in and surrender
                                   their bonds, but they could not stand upon the same footing as
                                   those who availed themselves of the privileges accorded by the
                                   Butler bill.
                              He then read the section of the law which pledges the tolls and
                                   revenues of the canal to the payment of the certificates, and
                                   that the State will not permit the tolls and revenues to be
                                   diverted from that purpose until the certificates are fully
                                   redeemed. He maintained that by this pledge the State was bound
                                   to defend the canal against the suit brought, and to protect it
                                   from sale and sequestration, and that if the State did not so
                                   protect it she would become liable for the payment of the
                                   certificates by taxation. The amount for which the State would
                                   thus become liable is about $18,000,000.
                              He said those who oppose the passage of this bill practically
                                   advocate repudiation, and made a strong appeal to Senators not to
                                   cast this stain upon the fair fame of the State. When he had
                                   concluded
                              Mr. NEFF made a demand for the previous question, to stop this
                                   argument at once. But by request he withheld it for the
                                   present.
                              Mr. HARNEY again took the floor and replied to Mr. Steele,
                                   declaring that he could not consistently vote for the bill in its
                                   present state. He said it seemed that whatever position was taken
                                   by the Assembly, the most direful consequences were to be
                                   apprehended. The Senator from Grant (Mr. Steele) supposes that
                                   all who embraced the provisions of the Butler bill did so from
                                   choice; that the inducements offered to them were such that they
                                   voluntarily came into the arrangement. That was not the case.
                                   Very many of them did so under a species of duress with the
                                   knowledge that the canal was good for nothing and upon the
                                   representations of the State that she would never make any other
                                   settlement with her creditors than that provided by the bill.
                              Now, he said, suppose that Mr. Charles Gould, who, in January,
                                   1872, surrendered four of the old interhal improvement bonds and
                                   took in place of them certificates of stock, to be paid by
                                   taxation, for one-half the amount and certificates of canal stock
                                   for the other half, the only value the canal stock had then being
                                   a prospective value to grow out of future legislation--suppose
                                   that Mr. Gould should come before this House and represent that
                                   he had been induced by the statements of the representatives of
                                   the State to believe she would make no other provision for the
                                   payment of the bonds than that prescribed by the bill and had
                                   therefore been persuaded to surrender his bonds and take one-half
                                   the amount in worthless scrip; that he had been deceived by the
                                   representation and, therefore, asked relief. Suppose the Assembly
                                   should refuse to give him relief, then on whose shoulders would
                                   lie the oblequy? Could he not go out and herald it to the world
                                   the State of Indiana had falsified her word to him, induced him
                                   to give up his bonds and take worthless scrip on a false
                                   representation?
                              Now, suppose, on the other hand, that Mr. Rothschild, for instance,
                                   who had given up his original bond and was a subscriber to the
                                   canal stock should stand by and see the canal sold by the order
                                   of the Carroll County Circuit Court and he dispossessed of his
                                   rights; and suppose after the canal had been sequestered that he
                                   should come back and say that the State had pledged herself to
                                   protect him in the possession of the canal, and had suffered it
                                   to pass from his control, and therefore was bound to indemnify
                                   him for the original debt? Which of the two cases is the
                                   hetter?
                              The speaker could not see any course they could take that was not
                                   encompassed with dangers except one. The people of the State at
                                   one time adjudicated on this matter. They did it in the most
                                   solemn manner, at a time when the facts were fully before them,
                                   and announced their decision in such clear terms that no one
                                   could mistake it; and the people for twenty-five years have acted
                                   on that decision. If it is repudiation to stand by a bill that
                                   has been on the statute books for twenty-five years, we are still
                                   in honorable company. All the officers of the State from the
                                   Governors down to those of the minor departments, have stood by
                                   the law. It has been the understanding on all hands that that
                                   settlement was a finality. It seemed to him that after we have
                                   spent the money and endeavored to rescue the credit of the State
                                   from the stain which is likely to be cast upon it, we are still
                                   liable to the same insinuation and obloquy from the other side
                                   claiming that we have not done justice by them. The fact that their original bonds have
                                   passed out of their possession does not extinguish their claim
                                   against the State any more than the destruction of a promissory
                                   note under a misapprehension of its value extinguishes the debt
                                   of which it was an evidence.
                              He said, in conclusion, that he would be willing to pay these
                                   parties a reasonable gross sum in final settlement of the
                                   controversy, but he could not vote for the pending bill.
                              Mr. BOONE held that by the fact that these holders of canal
                                   certificates stood off while the suit was in progress, and made
                                   no attempts to assert their rights, they would be barred from
                                   recourse on the State. He maintained, further, that the provision
                                   in the Butler bill that the State would make no provision for the
                                   payment of the improvement bonds other than that contemplated by
                                   the bill was still valid, and the State was bound in honor and
                                   good faith to abide by it. He said that for those of the 191
                                   bonds held by the Morris Canal Banking Company the State received
                                   no consideration.
                              Mr. GLESSNER was the last speaker in opposition to the measure, who
                                   stated, as a matter of history, that no consideration whatever
                                   was received by the State on account of the Morris Canal Banking
                                   Company, and the State was a loser of hundreds of thousands of
                                   dollars. He reiterated the statement that the State never
                                   received any consideration for them, and that they were therefore
                                   void. In 1841, through the perfidy and bad faith of many of those
                                   who received and negotiated these bonds the consideration that
                                   was to come to the State in exchange for them failed entirely,
                                   and that added greatly to the embarrassment of the State at the
                                   time when she failed to pay any interest on the bonds, and she
                                   was unable to pay interest on the bonds until 1846, when the
                                   Butler bill was passed. This bill was passed shortly after the
                                   issuing of the bonds, and the presumption was that they were
                                   still in the hands of the original holders. This bill of 1846
                                   gave notice to the world that they would pay these bonds in no
                                   other way than the one presented in the act. Therefore, those
                                   persons holding those bonds or who have received them since that
                                   time are not innocent hoIders, but stand in the same position
                                   with the original holders and therefore have no more equity than
                                   the original would have. When this bill was passed the best men
                                   in the State were in the Legislature. They said that that was a
                                   fair adjustment. They did not regard it as a repudiation, and it
                                   was understood at that time that the bondholders were satisfied
                                   with it.
                              He did not believe that the State was legally liable for the
                                   payment of these bonds, and yet we are told that the good faith
                                   of the State requires us to take from the pockets of the people
                                   and pay not only the principal, but the interest that has
                                   accumulated thereon, on account of which the State of Indiana has
                                   never received a dollar.
                              Mr. BROWN closed the debate with a speech in favor of the bill,
                                   declaring that he should cast his vote for the pending bill more
                                   from what appeared to him as a question of expediency, perhaps,
                                   than from what the legislative contract of 1846-7 expresses. The
                                   Legislature may do what it will, and the holders of the canal
                                   scrip will make its act a pretext to come back upon the State and
                                   call upon her to liquidate their claims. He believed it was
                                   better for the State to take up these bonds that are now
                                   surrendered, than to hazard the dire calamity which might follow
                                   having the canal taken away. His opposition heretofore to the
                                   payment of these bonds has been for fear the State might be
                                   dragged into a court of justice in order that some undue
                                   advantage might be taken of her. In his judgment, the State is
                                   now voluntarily doing more than, under the law and the contract,
                                   she could be called upon to do, and ke thought she perhaps had
                                   better do that than to stand by and allow the holders of the
                                   Wabash and Erie canal to harden their hearts against it so that
                                   they would allow that trust to be swept away, in order that they
                                   may bring up against the State a claim for the redemption of some
                                   eighteen or twenty millions of dollars.
                              He then reviewed the history of these bonds, and the legislation in
                                   regard to them. He reiterated his belief that it was the
                                   intention, by the bills of 1846-7, to relieve the State from all
                                   liability for the payment of one-half of the internal improvement
                                   debt. He read from the memorial presented to the General Assembly
                                   in 1852 by the creditors to prove that the adjustment was made on
                                   their application, and they were not dragged into it, as had been
                                   said. It is a matter of history that the bill was drawn up by
                                   Charles Butler, the accredited agent and attorney of a large
                                   portion of the creditors. He believed the contract relieved the
                                   State from all liability for the payment of one-half the debt,
                                   placing it upon those who surrendered the bonds, and that it was
                                   so understood on all hands at the time. He contended that if the
                                   State paid these out- standing bonds the holders of the certificates would claim
                                   payment from the State on the ground that she had violated her
                                   contract by paying the holders of the unsurrendered bonds in a
                                   different manner from that provided in the bill. But which course
                                   will give them the greater claim, to allow the canal to be
                                   sequestrated and sold, or the other course which will enable them
                                   to say that the contract has been broken. It was a choice between
                                   two evils, but he thought there would be less risk in pursuing
                                   the former course. Believing this he should vote for the
                                   bill.
                              At the close of Mr. Brown's remarks--
                              Mr. STEELE demanded the previous question, and the bill was passed
                                   by yeas, 30; nays, 18:

                                                  Taylor, Thompson, Wadge, Winterbotham, Mr.
                                                  President--30.
                                             Nays--Armstrong, Boggs, Bird, Boone, Bowman,

                                                  Gregg, Hall, Harney, Ringo, Slater, Smith, Stroud,
                                                  Williams--18.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Pending the roll call Mr. CARNAHAN explained his vote in opposition
                                   to the bill. He had the honor of a seat in the General Assembly
                                   at the time of the passage of the Butler bills, and was satisfied
                                   that the majority of the people of Indiana were opposed to this
                                   measure.
                              Mr. GREGG, when his name was called also explained his negative
                                   vote, believing that in voting against the bill he was fairly
                                   representing ninety-five per cent. of his constituency.
                              Mr. HALL voted no, believing the State to be entitled to the result
                                   of the negligence of these bondholders in allowing their
                                   guarantees to die by lapse of time.
                              On motion by Mr. BROWN the title of the bill was stricken out and
                                   the following substituted therefor:
                              "AN ACT to provide
                                   for the payment of sundry bonds or stocks, of the State of
                                   Indiana, issued prior to the year 1841, and declaring an
                                   emergency.
                              The following is the form of the bill as passed:
                              AN ACT to provide for the
                                   payment of sundry bonds or stocks of the State of Indiana issued
                                   prior to the year 1841, and declaring an emergency.

                                   1841, and upon others ofwhich the interest has been settled up to
                                   July, 1868; therefore,

                                   presentation at the Treasury of the State for redemption:
                                   Provided, That no bond or coupon shall be paid or redeemed until
                                   it shall have become due and payable according to the tenor and
                                   effect thereof.
                              SEC. 3. It shall be the duty of the Governor,
                                   Attorney General, Secretary of State and Treasurer of State to
                                   exercise the utmost scrutiny in testing the genuineness and
                                   validity of each bond and coupon which may be presented for
                                   redemption under the provisions of this act, and no bond or
                                   coupon shall be paid or redeemed unless the same is surrendered
                                   to the Treasurer of State at the time of redemption, and the
                                   bonds and coupons so redeemed shall be preserved by the Treasurer
                                   of State, and be subject to such disposition as the General
                                   Assembly may hereafter cause to be made thereof, and the
                                   Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State and Treasurer of
                                   State shall, immediately after making; any redemption under this
                                   act, prepare and sign a detailed description of the bonds and
                                   coupons so redeemed, with the date of their redemption, and such
                                   discription shall be filed in the office of the Auditor of State,
                                   and shall be recorded by him in some book to be provided and kept
                                   for that purpose.
                              SEC. 4. If at any time there shall not be money
                                   enough in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated to enable the
                                   officers of State, hereinbefore mentioned, to carry out the
                                   provisions of this act then, and in that case, it shall be lawful
                                   for the said officers of State to negotiate and make for, and on
                                   behalf of the State, a temporary loan or loans of such sum or
                                   sums of money as may be necessary, not, however, exceeding in the
                                   aggregate the sum of two hundred thousand dollars, on the best
                                   attainable terms, such loan or loans to be payable at the
                                   expiration of forty days from and after the commencement of the
                                   next succeeding session of the General Assembly.
                              SEC. 5. An emergency is hereby declared to exist
                                   requiring the immediate taking effect of this act; wherefore the
                                   same shall take effect and be in force from and after its
                                   passage.
                         
                         
                              THE DRAIN LAW.
                              On motion of Mr. HUBBARD, the vote by which a substitute for the
                                   drainage law [S. 88] was made the special order for next Tuesday,
                                   was reconsidered.
                              Mr. HUBBARD moved that the bill [S. 88] in relation to the
                                   construction of sewers, dykes and drains be taken from the table
                                   and read the second time.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS said that the bill provides that assessors shall be
                                   appointed by the several counties interested, and in a great many
                                   other respects is superior to the present law.
                              
                              On motion by Mr. HUBBARD the bill was then referred to the
                                        Committee on Corporations.
                         
                         
                              TWO PER CENT. CLAIMS.
                              Mr. STEELE, by consent, offered a joint resolution in relation to
                                   the two per cent. claims of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois pending
                                   before Congress, directing our Senators to favor the passage of a
                                   bill for the payment of said claims.
                              It passed the Senate: yeas, 45: nays, 0.
                              [NOTE.These claims on the part of Indiana amount to about
                                   $400,000.]
                              Mr. COLLETT, from the Committee on Enrolled
                                        Bills, reported that they had found Bill No. 65,
                                   ceding jurisdiction to the United States of ground in
                                   Indianapolis on which to erect public buildings, properly
                                   engrossed.
                         
                         
                              THE SUPREME COURT.
                              The PRESIDENT presented a cominunication from the Reporter of the
                                   Supreme Court, stating that about 460 decisions had been rendered
                                   other than those which would be contained in the thirty-fifth
                                   volume, which will appear in a few weeks. After the publication
                                   of that volume, the reports will be in arrears about six months.
                                   The causes of the failure to comply with the law, the Reporter
                                   states to be that since the advent of the new court, decisions
                                   have been made with unprecedented rapidity; and with the
                                   assistance and facilities at his command he was unable to keep up
                                   with the work, but that he has now obtained additional help and
                                   more material, and will be able soon to recover the lost
                                   ground.
                              It was referred to the Committee on the Organization of
                                        Courts.
                              The Senate then adjourned until to-morrow at 10 o'clock a.

                              FRIDAY, December 6, 1872.
                         
                         The House was called to order by the Speaker at nine a. m., and prayer
                              was offered by Rev. Mr. Chandler.
                         On motion of Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH, the reading of the journal was dispensed
                              with.
                         
                              THE CANAL BOND QUESTION.
                              Mr. KIMBALL, from the majority of the Committee on Ways
                                        and Means, submitted a lengthy report on his bill
                                   [H. R. 129] to protect the Wabash and Erie Canal, its tolls and
                                   revenues from sequestration and sale to satisfy any judgment
                                   growing out of bonds which are a lien upon the canal, and for the
                                   payment of which the State is liable.
                              The report gives a full history of the creation of the internal
                                   improvement debt, and the causes which led to the adjustment
                                   under the Butler bill, the manner in which that legislation was
                                   procured, the history of the Garrett suit, and the bonds
                                   outstanding held by the United States and others, and concludes
                                   with the expression of the belief that the State is liable for
                                   the payment of the unsurrendered bonds, that such payment will
                                   not make her liable on account of the canal certificates held by
                                   the present owners of the canal, but that, on the other hand,
                                   should she permit the canal to be sold to satisfy the Garrett
                                   judgment, she would become liable for the entire canal debt, for
                                   the reason that she had permitted the property given them in
                                   satisfaction of one-half their claim to be sold to satisfy a
                                   private claim against the State. The report concludes with a
                                   recommendation that the bill be passed.
                              Mr. WILLARD, from the same committee, submitted a minority report,
                                   signed by himself and Messrs. Peed and Brett. It proceeds upon
                                   the assumption that the Butler Bill, so called, is either valid
                                   or void: and, if valid, then Garrett has no claim for the reason
                                   that he has not complied with the requirements of the proviso
                                   which stipulates for the surrender of the bonds and the
                                   acceptance in lieu therof of canal certificates. The payment of
                                   the judgment of John W. Garrett would annul the proviso of the
                                   Butler Bill. Those who surrendered the bonds they held, under the
                                   Butler Bill, did so knowing there were others outstanding, which
                                   remained a lien upon the canal. They express the opinion that
                                   under no circumstances shout provision be made for more than the
                                   43 bonds held by Garrett; and believing that the provisions of
                                   the bill [H. R. 129] are fraught with danger, they recommend that
                                   it be laid on the table.
                              Mr. GRONENDYKE moved to print the majority report.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN moved, as an amendment, that both reports be laid upon
                                   the table, that five hundred copies of each be printed, and their
                                   consideration made the special order for Tuesday next,
                                   immediately after reading the journal.
                              The amendment was accepted by Mr. Gronendyke.
                              Mr. BAKER moved to amend by providing for the printing, in
                                   connection with the reports, of the Butler Bill.
                              
                              Mr. CAUTHORN moved to lay the amendment on the table.
                              The motion was agreed to, and then the order was adopted.
                         
                         
                              MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNOR--TWO PER CENT.
                                   FUND.
                              A message was received from the Governor in relation to the two per
                                   cent. fund of the States of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. His
                                   Excellency calls attention to the fact that Indiana, Ohio and
                                   Illinois have received only three per cent, from the proceeds of
                                   the sales of public lands within their borders, while other
                                   States have received the full five per cent., and urges action by
                                   the Legislature looking toward securing the passage of the bill
                                   now pending in Congress for the adjustment of the claims of these
                                   States, Indiana's claim amounting to over $400,000.
                              Mr. WALKER, from a majority of the Judiciary
                                        Committee, returned Mr. Willard's last
                                   will and testament bill [H. R. 62] recommending that it be laid
                                   on the table.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN, for the minority, dissented and submitted an
                                   amendment to the bill, which was rejected.
                              The majority report was concurred in.
                              Mr. MELLETT, from the Committee on Education,
                                   returned Mr. North's bill [H. R. 138] to amend the third
                                   section of the act authorizing cities and towns to negotiate and
                                   sell bonds for school building purposes, with an amendment to the
                                   first section, inserting these words: "On all property
                                   owned by said persons residing in the township where such city or
                                   town is located."

                                   engrossed.

                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The SPEAKER called the House to order at 2 p. m.
                              Mr. GIVAN moved to take from the table Mr. Furnas' bill

                              The motion Was agreed to.

                              NEW BILLS.
                              Mr. MELLETT introduced a bill [H. R. 200] to authorize and empower
                                   County Commissioners to equalize the bounties to soldiers.
                              It was referred to the Committee on Federal
                                        Relations.

                              It was referred to the Judiciary Committee.
                              Mr. PFRIMMER introduced a bill [H. R. 202] to amend the act
                                   prescribing the duties of coroners.

                              INDIANA CENTENNIAL ASSOCIATION.
                              Mr. Kimball's bill [H. R. 6] creating the Indiana
                                   Centennial Association was taken up in order and finally passed
                                   the House--yeas 76, nays 0.
                         
                         
                              FRANKLIN INSURANCE COMPANY.
                              Mr. Kimball's bill [H. R, 36] to amend sections one, six
                                   and sixteen of the act to incorporate the Franklin Insurance
                                   Company, approved February 13, 1851, was taken up on the third
                                   reading.
                              Mr. MILLER understood that one purpose of this bill is to make the
                                   charter of this company perpetual.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. It is an old charter, passed before the adoption of
                                   the present constitution. The charter ran for fifty years. The
                                   company was located in Franklin, in Johnson county. There is an
                                   alteration in the term of the charter; it is proposed to make it
                                   perpetual, but this does not take it beyond the control of the
                                   Legislature. It was desirable to change the location from
                                   Franklin to this city, and to fix the limit of the capital at
                                   $500,000; also also to so change it that each shareholder vote
                                   the full amount of his stock. It is not a life; but a fire
                                   insurance company.
                              The bill was passed the House--yeas 75, nays 2, with an amendment
                                   of the title, striking out the word
                                   "sixteen."
                         
                         
                              EARLIER WORK ON THE ROADS.
                              Mr. Ellsworth's bill [H. R. 59] to amend section six of
                                   the act to amend the act to provide for the election or
                                   appointment of supervisors, etc., was taken up on the third
                                   reading.
                              Mr. BUSKIRK desired to hear some explanation of the bill.
                              Mr. GLASGOW. I am not the author of the bill--he is not present.
                                   All the difference between this bill and and the law as it now
                                   stands is this; it permits some of the road work to be done in
                                   the month of March or April--commencing two months earlier. That
                                   is all the change.
                              Mr: MELLETT. It is a well known fact; that, as the law now stands,
                                   the busiest time in the year is the time it requires men to work
                                   the roads.
                              The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas 51,
                                   nays 30.
                         
                         
                              CHANGE OF VENUE EXPENSES.
                              Mr. North's bill [H. R. 130] relating to expenses incurred
                                   by change of venue, providing that the county from which such
                                   change is taken shall be responsible for the costs, including the charge for
                                   keeping the prisoner, etc., was taken up on the third reading and
                                   finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas 69, nays
                                   14.
                         
                         
                              RAILROAD CROSSINGS.
                              Mr. North's bill [H. R. 144] providing that when it
                                   becomes necessary for one railroad to cross another, the company
                                   owning the road last constructed shall bear the expense of making
                                   such crossing, and that subsequent costs for keeping the same in
                                   order shall be borne equally, was taken up in its order on the
                                   third reading, and finally passed the House of
                                   Representatives--yeas 84, nays 6.
                         
                         
                              GOVERNOR'S COMPENSATION.
                              On motion of Mr. CAUTHORN, the order of business was suspended for
                                   the consideration of messsages from the Senate.
                              The bill [S. 124] an act defining what shall be the salary of the
                                   Governor, and making provision for the payment of the same.
                                   [$8,000 a year for services and house rent, to be drawn
                                   quarterly] was taken up and considered on the first reading.
                              On motion of Mr. BRANHAM (the restrictions being suspended for the
                                   purpose) the bill was finally passed the House of
                                   Representatives, without amendment--yeas 85, nays 1.
                              The bill [S. 38] in reference to the sale of certain real estate,
                                   to provide a residence for the Governor, and to make an allowance
                                   in lieu thereof, was taken up and read the first time.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN moved that the rule be suspended and the bill put upon
                                   its passage.
                              The motion was agreed to; and then the bill was read the second and
                                   third times by title, and finally passed the House of
                                   Representatives without amendment--yeas, 85; nays, 0.
                              On motion of Mr. CAUTHORN the bills of the House numbered 164 and
                                   165, relative to the compensation of the Governor, which were
                                   ordered to be engrossed this morning, were taken up and laid on
                                   the table.
                              The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the
                                   Secretary of State transmitting a price list of stationery being
                                   furnished to members.
                         
                         
                              CITY SCHOOLS--LIBRARIES.
                              Mr. WALKER'S bill [H. R. 155] providing for a system of
                                   common schools in cities of 8,000 inhabitants and over, for the
                                   election of School Commissioners for such cities, for a school
                                   library etc., was taken up and read the third time.
                              Mr. WALKER. It is an exact copy of the bill passed at the last
                                   session, providing for a system of common schools in cities of
                                   30,000 or more inhabitants, which had also a provision by which
                                   cities of less than 30,000 might avail themselves of its
                                   provisions; but this provision was held to be defective for want
                                   of a perfect title. At present the Common Council appoint the
                                   School Board, which becomes an occasion of a good deal of
                                   political manoeuvering. This bill is to take this out of the
                                   hands of the politicians, and give to the people the opportunity
                                   of voting directly for the School Board.
                              Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH moved to recommit the bill with instructions to
                                   inquire whether the plan proposed is not too expensive, and
                                   whether the proposition is not in other respects inexpedient.
                              On motion of Mr. BAKER, the motion to recommit was laid on the
                                   table.
                              And then the bill was finally passed the House of
                                   Representatives--yeas 72, nays 4.
                              Messrs. Blocher, Cline and Pfrimmer obtained leave of absence till
                                   Monday.
                              A message was received from the Senate announcing the signing by
                                   the President of the House bill in relation to the completion of
                                   unfinished business by the next regular or special session.
                              On motion of Mr. CLARK, the claims the J. M. & I. R. R.
                                   Co., for transportation, were, by consent of the House, again
                                   referred to the Committee on Claims.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN presented the claims of the witnesses summoned in the
                                   Carroll county case for pay and mileage, and asked that they be
                                   referred to the committee on Public
                                        expenditures.
                              It was so ordered.
                              On motion of Mr. GIVAN, the House then adjourned till to-morrow at

                              PETITIONS.
                              Mr. SCOTT presented a communication from the President of the
                                   Indianapolis and Terre Haute Railroad Company in reference to the
                                   alleged claim of the State for surplus profits, in accordance
                                   with the provisions of the charter. He asked that it be read, and
                                   moved for the printing of 200 copies.
                              Objection being made to its reading, Mr. S. waived that
                                   request.
                              Mr. SLEETH considered it unnecessary to print this petition till
                                   the Railroad Committee shall be through with the
                                   investigation.
                              The motion to print was then discussed for some time and finally
                                   agreed to.
                              It is as follows:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             To the Senate and House of
                                                  Representatives of the State of Indiana:
                                             The President of the Terre Haute and Indianapolis
                                                  Railroad Company submits to your honorable bodies
                                                  the following communication:
                                             There seems to be an impression among many citizens
                                                  of the State that this company is indebted to the
                                                  Common School Fund in a large sum of money, under
                                                  the twenty-third section of its charter, which
                                                  provides : That when the dividends declared shall
                                                  amount to a sum equal to the capital invested, and
                                                  ten per centum por annum thereon, the Legislature
                                                  may so regulate the tolls of the road that but
                                                  fifteen per cent. of its earnings shall be
                                                  divided, and the residue over a contingent fund
                                                  shall be paid to the school fund, etc.
                                             Passing by the question (which is reserved), whether
                                                  this company can under said section twenty-three
                                                  be required to pay anything to the school fund,
                                                  without precedent legislation regulating the tolls
                                                  and declaring the dividends equal to the
                                                  investment and interest, the following statement
                                                  is submitted in regard to the capital invested and
                                                  dividends declared by the company :
                                             The whole amount of capital invested in said
                                                  railroad company is one million three hundred and
                                                  ninety thousand nine hundred and sixty-seven
                                                  dollars and fifty cents.
                                             The work was commenced in 1849 and cars were running
                                                  on the road in 1852. A portion of the money was
                                                  expended after the last date, much of it
                                                  before.
                                             Taking the year 1852 then as a point at which to
                                                  make an average calculation of interest, we have
                                                  twenty years interest to add to investment, with
                                                  this result, viz:

                                                  Capital invested and
                                                  interest..................

                                                  Excess of investment and interest over
                                                  dividends is
                                                  ..........................................
                                                  $697,150 27
                                                  
                                             
                                             The amount here given as capital invested is not
                                                  what the road cost, but is greatly less; it is
                                                  what the road actually cost the stockholders
                                                  independent of the earnings of the road.
                                             
                                             The entire coat of the road is $1,988,150 00. Of
                                                  this amount tbe sum of $597,182 50 was paid out of
                                                  the earnings of the road, and for that sum
                                                  dividends in stock were issued to the
                                                  stockholders, making the capital stock thus equal
                                                  to the cost of the road. The amount of stock,
                                                  however, is not material; it is the capital
                                                  invested with interest, which must be paid to the
                                                  stockholders out of the earnings of the road,
                                                  before anything can accrue to the school fund.
                                             A tabular statement is hereto attached, showing the
                                                  amount of dividends which have been paid each
                                                  year, semi-annnally and the aggregate thereof. It
                                                  will be seen by the foregoing statement that the
                                                  dividends so far declared and paid do not equal
                                                  the amount of capital invested and ten per cent,
                                                  interest per annum thereon by several hundred
                                                  thousand dollars, and that therefore nothing can
                                                  be due from the company to the school fund.
                                             The calculation of interest on the investment, as
                                                  will be seen, is only averaged ; but a minute
                                                  calculation can not materially vary the
                                                  result.
                                             It has been insisted, however, that this company was
                                                  carrying an unreasonable surplus contingent fund
                                                  in order to avoid declaring dividends, and the
                                                  manner of making up the annual reports of the
                                                  company heretofore gives color to this idea. For
                                                  instance, in the last annual report, the surplus
                                                  fund is stated to be more than one million of
                                                  dollars, a copy of which is hereto attached,
                                                  marked "Q ;" whereas, in fact,
                                                  that fund was but little over two hundred thousand
                                                  dollars, as will appear by attached statement,
                                                  marked "X," and it mostly
                                                  consists of assets that are not at present
                                                  available without sacrifice.
                                             The capital invested by the company as herein
                                                  stated, is based on the amount expended on the
                                                  cost of building the road from Indianapolis to
                                                  Terre Haute, the whole cost between those points
                                                  being as stated, $1,988,150 00.
                                             Up to 1869 the road extended no further west than
                                                  Terre Haute, the company having, previous to that
                                                  time, a running arrangement with other railroads
                                                  to St. Louis. At this time a company was
                                                  organized, under the laws of this State, to build
                                                  another railroad from Terre Haute to Indianapolis
                                                  (which has since been built), which company had a
                                                  lease for ninety-nine years on the St. Louis,
                                                  Alton and Terre Haute Railroad, the only road then
                                                  running west from Terre Haute. It thus became
                                                  necessary for this company to get a connection
                                                  with St. Louis, or become a mere local road, and
                                                  lose a great amount of its business. The company,
                                                  therefore, extended its road west to the State
                                                  Line, at a cost of $449,860 71, which makes part
                                                  of the surplus fund reported--that sum not being
                                                  on hand at all, but having been paid out to build
                                                  the road to the State Line. It also became
                                                  necessary for this company to assist the St.
                                                  Louis, Vandalia and Terre Haute Railroad Company
                                                  to build its road from the State Line to St.
                                                  Louis; and this company, to that end, paid the sum
                                                  of $265,000 for stock in said railroad company,
                                                  which stock is not worth over $45,000, and to
                                                  purchase $328,500 worth of the mortgage bonds of
                                                  said company. These bonds are not at present
                                                  saleable, but are worth about what they cost. It
                                                  is believed that this was a good investment for
                                                  this company, even if the stock should prove to be
                                                  worthless, and a loss of twenty per cent, on the
                                                  bonds should occur, as it was absolutely necessary
                                                  to get the western connection, and it could have
                                                  been had in no other way. The bonds, stocks and
                                                  accounts of the other railroad companies held by
                                                  this company, and going to make up the surplus
                                                  fund, were obtained in helping said companies
                                                  construct their roads to make northern and
                                                  southern connections with the road of this
                                                  company, and the money was well invested if the
                                                  whole amount should be lost.
                                             It will be seen by statement "Q"
                                                  that the company owes eight hundred thousand
                                                  dollars, and owns five hundred and twenty-two
                                                  thousand and nine hundred dollars of its own
                                                  stock. This stock was purchased at its full value
                                                  to prevent parties getting a controlling interest
                                                  in the road, who, it was believed, would have
                                                  mismanaged it for their own profit. There was no
                                                  speculation in the transaction, nor any design to
                                                  defraud the school fund.
                                             With this explanation of what, at first blush, seems
                                                  an excessive surplus fund, it is submitted that in
                                                  no view of the question does the company owe the
                                                  school fund anything.
                                             This company has been advised that it could not be
                                                  called upon to pay over anything under the
                                                  twenty-third section of its charter, until the
                                                  Legislature had first taken action to regulate the
                                                  tolls Nevertheless this company now is, and always
                                                  has been, willing to make a full exhibit of all
                                                  its financial proceedings, and if, upon a fair
                                                  accounting, anything is found due the school fund,
                                                  to make no technical objections to its
                                                  payment.
                                             The officers of the company now believe, and have
                                                  always thought, there is nothing due; and if
                                                  anything can be found due, and their calculations
                                                  are wrong, the error, if any, is based on mistake,
                                                  and does not proceed from design.
                                             The Superintendent of Public Instruction, who has
                                                  the care of the school fund, has been invited to
                                                  examine the books of the corporation, and to make
                                                  his own calculations ; and a like invitation is

                                                  appointed by the Legislature for that purpose, and
                                                  the undersigned will furnish the Legislature or
                                                  any committee thereof any further information
                                                  required on the subject.
                                             A suit has been instituted against the company is
                                                  the Putnam Circuit Court, by the Prosecuting
                                                  Attorney of that circuit, under said twenty-third
                                                  section, not to recover the amount of money
                                                  supposed to be due the school fund, but to forfeit
                                                  the franchise of the company for a supposed
                                                  failure to pay over money to said fund. This
                                                  proceeding at a distance from the main office of
                                                  the company, which is located in Terre Haute, is
                                                  very inconvenient to the company, is harsher in
                                                  its nature, and is one to which the company may be

                                             Believing the State cannot desire the forfeiture of
                                                  the franchises of this great corporation, nor want
                                                  anything more from it than the money thought to be
                                                  due the school fund, the undersigned asks your
                                                  honorable bodies for such action or legislation as
                                                  may reach a judicial determination whether
                                                  anything is due said fund without disturbing its
                                                  franchises. The company will consent, for that
                                                  purpose, to appear to any action brought to
                                                  recover the money, and will interpose no obstacle
                                                  to a full and fair investigation of that question;
                                                  and he asks that the quo warranto proceedgins may

                              The amendments were not read, but the report was concurred in.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS, from the Committee on Banks,
                                   returned the bill [S. 63] in relation to holidays to be observed

                                   rate mentioned in the obligation, with a favorable
                                   recommendation.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              Mr. BEARDSLEY, from the Committee on
                                        Manufactures, returned the bill [S. 96] to
                                   encourage manufacturing in this State, with amendments striking
                                   out the provision restricting the donation to forty acres.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN, from the Committee on Public
                                        Printing, returned the resolution of inquiry into
                                   raised vouchers of Public Printers, reporting the same with a
                                   recommendation that the words "The President of the
                                   Senate appoint a special committee of five members of the
                                   Senate" be stricken
                                   out and the words "Committee on Public
                                        Printing" substituted in lieu.
                              The report was concurred in.
                         
                         
                              SUPREME COURT DISTRICTS.
                              Mr. DAGGY, from the Committee on Organization of Courts of
                                        Justice, returned the bill [8. 52], dividing the
                                   State into five Supreme Court Judicial Districts, with a majority
                                   report recommending a substitute therefor.
                              Mr. HOUGH presented a minority report from the same committee,
                                   dissenting from the majority report for constitutional reasons,
                                   that the districts should be composed of contiguous territory.
                                   They report a substitute for the bill [S. 52]. Mr. Hough
                                   constitutes the minority and dissents on the ground that the
                                   extension proposed by the majority is in violation of a section
                                   of the Constitution, which provides that "such districts
                                   shall be formed of contiguous territory as nearly equal in
                                   population as, without dividing a county, the same can be
                                   made." He says he finds a difference between two
                                   counties, which can be remedied by his substitute, whereby the
                                   districts will be composed of contiguous territory, and the
                                   population in each will be as follows: In the first district,
                                   335,041; second district, 334,456; third district, 335,466;
                                   fourth district, 334,274; fifth district, 336,809.
                              Mr. GLESSNER moved that the reports lie on the table and be made
                                   the special order for Wednesday next at 2 o'clock p.
                                   m.
                              Mr. DAGGY opposed postponment, as it was important to put this bill
                                   forward.
                              Mr. GLESSNER modified his motion by changing the time from
                                   Wednesday till Monday.
                              Mr. HOUGH urged the concurrance of the Senate in the minority
                                   report, which makes a variance of but about 2,000 from the lowest
                                   to the highest number in each district, while in the bill
                                   recommended by the majority there is a difference in population
                                   between the districts of about six thousand. He favored the
                                   motion to make the subject the special order for Monday at 2
                                   o'clock p. m.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE moved to amend by making the subject the special
                                   order for this afternoon at 2 o'clock.
                              On motion by Mr. GLESSNER, this amendment was laid on the table.The
                                   motion to make these reports the special order for Monday
                                   afternoon was agreed to.
                         
                         
                              REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN, from the Committee on Organization
                                        of Courts, returned the bill [S. 51] to amend
                                   section 1 of the Supreme Court organization act of May 13,1852,
                                   with a favorable report thereon.
                              The bill was set for consideration with the special order on Monday
                                   afiernoon.
                              Mr. GLESSNER returned from the Committee on Organization
                                        of Courts, Mr. Boone's bill [S. 78] to
                                   amend section 19 of the justices act of May 29, 1852, with a
                                   recommendation from the majority that it lie on the table.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              Mr. HOUGH, from the Committee on Organization of
                                        Courts, returned the bill [S. 30] to amend the
                                   Supreme Court organization act, with a recommendation that it lie
                                   on the table, its provisions being included in other bills before
                                   the Senate.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              Mr. DAGGY, from the same committee, returned the bill [H. R. 32] to
                                   provide times for Common Pleas Courts in the Sixteenth District,
                                   with a favorable report.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              He also returned the bill [H. R. 49] creating the Twenty-second
                                   Judicial Circuit, with a similar report.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              He also returned from the same committee the bill [S. 68] to amend
                                   the second section of the 23d Common Pleas District act, with a
                                   recommendation that it pass.
                              These reports were severally concurred in.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN, from the Committee on the Rights and
                                        Privileges of the inhabitants of the State,
                                   reported back the bill to protect bodies of water from which
                                   supplies are taken for cities, etc., from defilement with an
                                   amendment in relation to the penalty for its violation and

                              It was concurred in.

                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              Mr. BROWN, from the Committee on Railroads,
                                   returned the bill [S. 6] concerning the transportation of
                                   freights and passengers over railroads in this state, with
                                   several amendments, and a recommendation that after the adoption
                                   of the amendments the bill be passed. The amendments were merely
                                   verbal, except one, which makes the provisions of the bill appy
                                   to all common carriers.
                              
                              The report was laid on the table, and the bill, as well as Mr.
                                   Brown's bill upon the same subject, [115], were made the
                                   special order for next Monday at ten o'clock a. m.
                              On motion by Mr. DITTEMORE, all bills having reference to this
                                   subject were made the special order for next Tuesday at ten
                                   o'clock.
                         
                         
                              STATE AGENT.
                              Mr. GREGG offered a resolution that the Judiciary
                                        Committee return the bill [S. 21] to abolish the
                                   office of State Agent on Monday next. Two years ago he urged the
                                   passage of a similar bill, but the seemingly good reasons against
                                   such action at that time have passed away, and there can be no
                                   serious opposition. By the terms of the bill passed yesterday,
                                   the State Agent will have nothing to do with the payment of the
                                   old Internal Improvement bonds.
                              After debate the resolution was adopted.
                         
                         
                              TAXATION.
                              Mr. BEARDSLEY offered a resolution, which was adopted, that the
                                   Finance Committee inquire into the expediency of making a general
                                   revision of the laws relating to taxation, and the assessment and
                                   collection of taxes.
                         
                         
                              INTOXICATING LIQUORS.
                              Mr. DAGGY offered a resolution the Committee on
                                        Temperance report a bill on the subject of
                                   retailing intoxicating liquors, embracing the following
                                   provision: First, that no license shall be granted for the sale
                                   of liquors except upon a petition to the Board of Commissioners
                                   signed by a majority of all persons over twenty-one years of age
                                   within the district where the petitioner desires to sell; second,
                                   that licensed liquor dealers shall be responsible for damages
                                   caused wholly or partially by intoxication which they have been
                                   instrumental in producing.
                              Mr. BROWN moved to amend so as to instruct the committee to inquire
                                   into the expediency of passing such a bill.
                              The amendment was accepted and the resolution as amended was
                                   adopted.
                         
                         
                              NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                              Bills for acts were introduced, read the first time and severally
                                   passed to the second reading, to-wit:

                                   laws, and declaring an emergency. [The bill provides for the care
                                   and custody of inebriates among other unfortunates, and
                                   appropriates $50,000 for the sanitarium.]

                                   approved May 13,1859. [It proposes an appropriation for the
                                   completion of said institution.]
                              Mr. BROWN, a bill [S. 132] to amend the twentieth section of the
                                   act of May 13, 1859, to establish a reformatory institution for
                                   women and children. [It provides that such persons may be
                                   admitted and detained till eighteen years of age.]
                              Mr. SCOTT, a bill [S. 133] to provide for a more extended and

                                   again--better take its place in the calendar.
                         
                         
                              OTHER COMMITTEE REPORTS.
                              Mr. EDWARDS, of Lawrence, from the Committee on the
                                        Organization of Courts, returned Mr.
                                   Wood's bill [H. R. 180] to abolish the grand jury
                                   system, reporting a motion that it be laid on the table.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              Mr. CLAYPOOL, from the same committee, returned Mr. Wilson of
                                   Ripley's first Judicial Circuit Court bill [H. R. 177]
                                   recommending its passage.
                              It was ordered to be engrossed.
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE, from the Committee on Banks,
                                   returned Mr. Riggs' bill [H. R. 198] to amend sections
                                   15, 19, 31, and 49 of the act of May 12, 1869, providing for the
                                   organization of savings banks and the safe and proper management
                                   of their affairs, recommending its passage.
                              It was ordered to be engrossed.
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE stated that the single object of the bill is to
                                   make the statutes harmonize with the holiday provisions of Mr.
                                   Buskirk's bill [H. R. 64] which will become law--so that
                                   all notes, etc., falling due on those newly made holidays shall
                                   be deemed and treated as due the day previous--and so that
                                   business men and bankers may have equal chance with others to
                                   observe those days.
                         
                         
                              PER DIEM BILL.
                              Mr.WOODARD, from the Committee on Fees and
                                        Salaries, returned Mr. Wilson of Ripley's
                                   bill [H. R. 73], fixing the per diem and mileage of members of
                                   the General Assembly ($8); members providing their own
                                   stationery, recommending its passage.
                              The question being on the third reading:
                              Mr. RENO said: With all due deference for the opinions of my
                                   brother Representatives who differ with me as to the merits of
                                   this bill, I hope they will pardon me for saying, for I say it
                                   not in spirit of offense, but give it as my honest conviction,
                                   that it is unjust and impolitic for the members of this House to
                                   attempt of even to advocate the passage of this bill in the
                                   present session. And for this reason the constitution provides
                                   that if the General Assembly shall pass a law increasing their
                                   own pay, it shall not take effect during the session in which it
                                   was pased. Now it is clearly evident to every reflecting mind,
                                   that the true intent and meaning of this section in the
                                   Constitution was to protect the people from unscrupulous  legislation on this very
                                   subject. So that if members of the General Assembly voted
                                   themselves additional pay before they could reap the benefits of
                                   their own act, it would have to be submitted to the people for
                                   their confirmation or rejection. Governor Baker, who has so
                                   faithfully watched over the interests of the State, believing
                                   that he could further those interests by convening the
                                   Legislature, issued his proclamation for a call session. In
                                   obedience to that call we are now in session. An emergency has
                                   called us together to grotect the interests of the State. But we
                                   take advantake of that emergency and are trying to pass a bill
                                   through this session, and expect to reap the benefits of our own
                                   act in the next session, in direct violation of the spirit of the
                                   Constitution. Mr. Speaker, when our charitable institutions are
                                   amply provided for, and when there is money enough in the common
                                   school fund to give all the children in the State of Indiana six
                                   months' schooling in the year, instead of three as it
                                   nowv is, then I might vote for a bill increasing our own pay, but
                                   not until then. It is asserted by the friends of this bill that
                                   it will bring a higher order of political or statesmanlike talent
                                   into these legislative halls. I will admit that if the General
                                   Assembly raise their pay so as to cause men to seek for the
                                   office for its benefits, that, in all all probability, it may
                                   bring into these legislative halls a purer and more brilliant
                                   article of political gas. But as to its bringing a higher order
                                   of patriotism and practical common sense. I have my sincere
                                   doubts; therefore I hope the bill will not pass.
                              Mr. WILLARD demanded the previous question, but withdrew it at the
                                   request of
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. I am not unwilling, Mr. Speaker, to take rny part of
                                   this responsibility; and I desire to say distinctly that I am in
                                   favor of this bill, and I should be more in favor of it were it
                                   for $10 a day. If the Legislature do not put a proper estimate
                                   upon its services the people will not. The people should know
                                   that gentlemen can't afford to come to the Legislature
                                   if it is simply a question of money. And it is simply a question
                                   of honor or a question of pay. If it is a question of honor
                                   alone, let us come in here, pay our own expenses and go out with
                                   credit and honor. But if it is a question of pay as well, the
                                   State is able to pay and she ought to pay well. With regard to
                                   the objects of this special session, called by the Governor for
                                   special public emergencies, is it not a fact that the Governor
                                   has called our attention to his own compensation and the salary
                                   of his successors? And we have already recommended a bill for the
                                   Governar's benefit, and another to raise the salary of
                                   his successors. Is it possible, that, because we are afraid of
                                   some little delicacy in this matter, we will all say we are five
                                   dollar men? Sir, a clerk in any dry goods store may get as much.
                                   Who that has any business at all but can do better for himself
                                   than to come here for five dollars a day? It was well remarked in
                                   a little circle last night that members of the Legislature ought
                                   to be regarded at least as gentlemen--when they come here they
                                   should be expected to take life easy enough at least to live in a
                                   good house. They should not be compelled to go to the outskirts
                                   of the city to find places of living where they may avoid going
                                   into debt. I say again, that the State is able to compensate men
                                   for their services here. As for myself, I did not ask to come
                                   here, but was sent here against my wishes; and I put myself upon
                                   my inalienable rights; and if those who sent me here do not want
                                   me again, let them send somebody else. Then let us put such a
                                   value upon our services as will be sufficient to make them
                                   respectable. For it is becoming a matter that the people of the
                                   country are laughing at--so that a member of the Legislature is
                                   some man you have got to run down--as some man who can't
                                   earn a living at home, and comes here as a matter of
                                   makeshift.

                              Mr. RUMSEY, from the Committee on Rights and
                                        Privileges, returned the bill [H. R. 132] defining

                                   to the Judiciary Committee; and also Mr.
                                   Wesner's liquor license law amendment bill [H. R. 156]
                                   with a motion to refer it to the Committee on
                                        Temperance.
                              The reports were concurred in.

                                   returned Mr. Thompson of Elkhart's bill [H. R. 105] to
                                   amend section eleven of the manufacturing and mining corporations
                                   act of May 25, 1852, with an amendment by way of substitute, viz:

                                   which was passed to the second reading.
                              Mr. RICHARDSON, from the Committee on
                                        Corporations, returned Mr. Butterworth's
                                   Notre Dame charter amendment bill [H. R. 145], with a motion that
                                   it be laid on the table.
                              Mr. BUTTER WORTH moved that it be referred to the
                                        Judiciary Committee.
                              It was so ordered.
                              Mr. GIFFORD, from the Committee on Cities and
                                        Towns, reported back, with the recommendation that
                                   it pass, Mr. Baker's bill [H. R. 174] to amend the act
                                   for the incorporation of cities and towns.
                              It was ordered to the engrossment.
                              Mr. JOHNSON, from the Committee on Public
                                        Expenditures, returned the claims of Judson
                                   Applegate, Bernard Daily, and others, for compensation as
                                   witnesses before a committee of this House, with a motion for an
                                   order that they be referred to the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means, with instructions to put the said allowance
                                   into the specific appropriation bill.
                              Mr. BROADUS returned his Sixth District Common Pleas Court bill [H.
                                   R. 172] recommending its passage.
                              It was ordered to be engrossed.
                              Mr. BAXTER submitted a preamble and concurrent resolution for the
                                   reward of a thousand dollars to any architect who shall present
                                   to this General Assembly a plan and specifications for the
                                   construction of a new capitol--the same to be paid only to the
                                   architect whose plan shall be accepted; and that a joint
                                   committee of three on the part of the House, and two on the part
                                   of the Senate, be appointed to receive such plans and
                                   specifications and present them to the General Assembly at the
                                   regular session of 1873; provided, that no payment shall be made
                                   for any plans or specifications except such as shall finally be
                                   adopted.
                              Mr. BAXTER said as it was expected that some steps would be taken
                                   at the next session for a new State House, this is the best thing
                                   we can do to show what will be the expense of the new
                                   capitol.
                              Mr. RICHARDSON. I think it is use less. In the first place, no
                                   respectable architect will draw a plan fur such an extensive
                                   building without pay. I understand it is a rule with architects.
                                   But in addition to that objection the time is too short.
                              The resolution was adopted.
                              The SPEAKER took up the call by counties and districts for
                         
                         
                              NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                              Mr. GIFFORD introduced a bill [H. R. 204] to legalize sales of real
                                   estate by guardians, under orders defective in not prescribing
                                   notice and without finding that the interests of wards would be
                                   promoted by dispensing with such notice, etc.
                              Mr. ELLSWORTH introduced a bill [H. R. 205] to divide the State
                                   into Congressional Districts.
                              It was referred to the Committee Elections.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN submitted a resolution (which was adopted) that the
                                   principal Secretary of the Senate and the principal Clerk of the
                                   House of Representatives shall be allowed $150 cash for indexing
                                   and superintending the printing of the journals of the two Houses
                                   of the General Assembly; and that the Committee on Ways
                                        and Means be instructed to put said allowance in
                                   the specific bill.
                              Mr. KING presented a claim, and also a communication from the
                                   President of Terre Haute Railroad Company, which were referred
                                   without reading--the former to the Committee on
                                        Claims, and the latter to the Committee
                                        on the Judiciary.
                              Mr. EDWARDS, of Lawrence, introduced a bill [H. R. 206] to amend
                                   section one of the act to organize a Supreme Court and prescribe
                                   certain duties of theJudges thereof, approved May 13, 1842. (The
                                   Supreme Court shall consist of five Judges, three of whom shall
                                   form a quorum.)
                              It was referred to the Committee on the Organization of
                                        Courts.
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE introduced a bill [H. R. 207] to provide for the
                                   semi-annual collection of taxes (one-half on the first of January
                                   and the other on the first of July; provided that road taxes
                                   shall be paid in full on the first of January.)
                              It was referred to the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY introduced a bill [H. R. 208] to legalize the acts of
                                   the Trustees of the town of Mooresville.
                              It was referred to the Committee on
                                   Corporations.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY introduced a bill [H. R. 209] relating to fencing
                                   railroads and placing cattle guards thereon. The object of the
                                   bill is to place the railroad company and the owners of land
                                   along their lines in the same position with regard to fencing,
                                   that the law places persons building and keeping in repair a
                                   partition fence
                              
                              It was referred to the Committee on
                                   Railroads.
                              Mr. BUTTS introduced a bill [H. R. 210] defining it as a
                                   misdemeanor to keep a house of ill fame, to rent or lease a house
                                   to be used as a house of ill fame, and prescribing certain rules
                                   of evidence in the prosecution of such offenses.
                              It was referred to the Committee on Reformatory
                                        Institutions.
                              Mr. BAXTER introduced a bill [H. R. 211] to amend the twentieth
                                   section of the act approved May 13, 1869, to establish a female
                                   prison and reformatory institution for girls and women, etc.
                              Mr. BAXTER introduced a bill [H. R. 212] supplemental to the act to
                                   establish a reformatory institution for girls and women.
                              It was referred to the Committee on Reformatory
                                        Institntions.
                         
                         
                              TWENTY-SEVENTH (CRIMINAL) JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.
                              Mr. GLASGOW returned from the Committee on the
                                        Organization of Courts Mr. Willard's bill
                                   [H. R. 61] to repeal the act of April 23,1869, to create the
                                   Twenty-seventh (Criminal) Judicial Circuit, with amendments,
                                   which were adopted.
                              Mr. WILLARD. This is a bill repealing the act establishing a
                                   criminal court for the counties of Clark and Floyd. It is the
                                   almost unanimous opinion of the people of those counties that
                                   that court is unnecessary. And it being necessary that they
                                   should be able to remove the business of that criminal court to
                                   the Civil Circuit Court in time for the January term, I move to
                                   suspend the restrictions that the bill may be considered on the
                                   third reading.
                              Mr. BAKER, having presented remonstrances against the passage of
                                   the bill, moved that its consideration be either postponed till
                                   next week, or that it be laid on the table; and (Mr. Willard
                                   consenting) it was laid on the table, taking its place in the
                                   calendar.
                              Mr. Anderson obtained leave of absence till Tuesday, Mr. Woollen
                                   till Wednesday, and Mr. Schmuck till Tuesday.
                              Mr. BILLINGSLY moved'the adjournment, and, according to
                                   the previous order, the House adjourned till Monday, two
                                   o'clock p. m.
                         
                    
                    
                    
                         THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                         
                         THIRTEENTH VOLUME.
                         
                         INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
                         
                         IN SENATE.
                         
                              MONDAY, December 9, 1872.
                         
                         The Senate met at two o'clock pursuant to adjournment,
                              President Friedley in the chair.
                         On motion, the reading of the journal was dispensed with.
                         
                              A FIFTH SUPREME JUDGE.
                              The PRESIDENT announced the special order, Mr. Taylor's
                                   bill [S. 51] to amend the act of May 13, 1852, to organize a
                                   Supreme Court and prescribe the duties of the Judges thereof. [It
                                   proposes to make the Supreme Court to consist of five Judges,
                                   three of whom shall constitute a quorum.]
                              It was read the second time.
                              A quorum not being present, the bill was passed over for future
                                   consideration.
                              The bill submitted by Mr. Hough, with the minority report of the
                                        Judiciary Committee on the same subject,
                                   which was was a part of the special order, was taken up. [The
                                   bill located the additional district in the eastern part of the
                                   State, instead of the northern, as was provided in the bill
                                   reported by the majority]--it being the bill [S. 52] dividing the
                                   State into five Judicial Districts. The minority report was read
                                   by the Secretary and the subsfitute for the bill reported by the
                                   minority--the question being on concurring in the report.
                              Mr. HOUGH understood that the minority report was in strict
                                   compliance with the Costitutional requirement as set forth in
                                   section three of article seven; and that the majority report is
                                   in conflict with that requirement, because the districts as
                                   formed by the majority of the Committee are not composed of
                                   contiguous territory. The lines of the districts when drawn on a
                                   map, look like a badly stove up burnt boot, while the division of
                                   the territory proposed by the minority, looks on the map as if
                                   the districts were as perfectly formed as they could be, as well
                                   as regards contiguity of territory as equality in the number of
                                   inhabitants. Parties in the eastern and middle portion of the
                                   State, under the bill reported by the majority, desiring to
                                   consult a Supreme Judge in vacation, would have to travel to
                                   Vevay in the extreme south, or to Fort Wayne in the north part of
                                   the State, or through Indianapolis to Bloomington. He urged the
                                   adoption of the minority report. The bill recommended by the
                                   majority looked as if there was some gerrymandering in it. He
                                   would not charge that any such thing was intended, but it would
                                   give rise to suspicions that such was the motive in framing it.
                                   For the reasons adduced he urged the passage of the bill reported
                                   by him.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE moved that the minority report be laid on the table.
                                   The yeas and nays were called, and the vote resulted--yeas, 20;
                                   nays, 16.
                              So the motion was agreed to.
                              The question now recurred upon the adoption of the majority report,
                                   which recommends the passage of the bill [S. 52] which divides
                                   the State as follows, by counties:
                              
                              First District--Monroe, Owen, Clay, Parke, Morgan, Sullivan,
                                   Greene, Knox, Daviess, Martin, Dubois, Pike, Gibson, Posey,
                                   Vanderburg, Warrick, Spencer, Perry and Orange.
                              Second District--Rush, Switzerland, Dearborn, Brown, Lawrence,
                                   Crawford, Harrison, Floyd, Clarke, Scott, Jefferson, Ripley,
                                   Decatur, Bartholomew, Jackson, Washington and Jennings.
                              Third District--Tippecanoe, Johnson, White, Warren, Fountain,
                                   Montgomery, Clinton, Boone, Tipton, Hamilton, Marion, Vermillion,
                                   Hendricks and Vigo.
                              Fourth District--Allen, Whitley, Huntington, Wells, Adams, Grant,
                                   Blackford, Jay, Delaware, Randolph, Howard, Madison, Hancock,
                                   Henry, Fayette, Union and Franklin.
                              Fifth District--Lake, Benton, Porter, La Porte, St. Joseph,
                                   Elkhart, Kosciusko, Marshall, Starke, Jasper, Newton, Pulaski,
                                   Fulton, Wabash, Miami, Cass, Carroll, Lagrange, Steuben, Ke Kalb
                                   and Noble.
                              The bill also provides for the appointment of an additional judge
                                   for the Fifth District.
                              Mr. DAGGY spoke in favor of concurrence in the report of the
                                   majority of the committee. He said that the report of the Clerk
                                   of the Supreme Court showed that the business of the court was
                                   now behind about four years. More than that, the court now
                                   consists of four judges, and a fifth one was necessary to prevent
                                   a tie in rendering decisions. He defended the division of the
                                   State made by the majority, and urged concurrence in it.
                              The report was concurred in, and the bill was read the second time
                                   by sections.
                              Mr. THOMPSON moved to amend by substituting another
                                   apportionment.
                              Mr. ROSEBRUGH moved that the amendment be laid on the table.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. DAGGY moved to suspend the constitutional restriction that the
                                   bill may be read the third time now and put upon its passage.
                              The motion was agreed to by yeas 34, nays 4, and the bill passed,
                                   yeas 30, nays 7.
                              On motion by Mr. O'BRIEN, the constitutional restriction
                                   was dispensed with by yeas 34, nays 2, and the bill [S. 51] to
                                   amend section one of an act entitled an act to organize a Supreme
                                   Court, and prescribing certain duties of the Judges thereof,
                                   approved May 13, 1852, was read the third time, and passed--yeas
                                   36, nays 1.
                         
                         
                              AGENT OF STATE.
                              Mr. BROWN, in compliance with a resolution from the Senate,
                                   returned the bill [S. 21] repealing the act of June 17, 1852, to
                                   create the office of State Agent, and prescribing that the duties
                                   of that officer shall be performed by the Secretary of State. The
                                   committee recommended that the bill lay on the table, and that an
                                   accompanying bill be passed by the Senate, It is entitled,
                                   "A bill [S. 141] in relation to the funded debt of the
                                   State of Indiana therein mentioned."
                              [The bill abolishes the office of State Agent after the 10th of
                                   February, 1873, and provides that the business connected with the
                                   canal claims shall be transacted at the office of the Treasurer
                                   of State after the 1st of February, 1873. It also provides for
                                   the appointment of a State Agent at New York City for the
                                   transaction of business relating to the war loans of the State,
                                   and such other business of the State as is required by law to be
                                   transacted in New York, whose compensation shall not exceed $500
                                   per annum, and who shall give bonds for the faithful performance
                                   of his duties.]
                              Mr. BROWN said: It is an exact copy of a bill prepared by Governor
                                   Baker, and has been examined by several gentlemen thoroughly
                                   acquainted with the subject matter thereof, it provides that the
                                   acting agent shall receive no more than $500 per annum. Mr. Brown
                                   urged its immediate passage.
                              The report of the committee was concurred in.
                              Mr. GREGG moved to dispense with the Constitutional restriction
                                   that the bill [S. 141] may be read the second time and put upon
                                   its passage now.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              In reply to questions of Mr. HARNEY, Mr. BROWN stated that the bill
                                   leaves the State officers to drive the best bargain they can with
                                   some one in the city of New York to perform what little duties
                                   still appertain to the office of State Agent, but in no case
                                   shall the State officers allow their appointee more than $500 a
                                   year.
                              The bill then passed--yeas, 36; nays, 0.
                         
                         
                              PETITIONS.
                              Mr. THOMPSON presented a petition on the subject of temperance,
                                   which was referred to the appropriate committee without
                                   reading.
                         
                         
                              REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                              Mr. OLIVER, from the Committee on Public
                                        Buildings, returned the bill [S. 87] ceding to the
                                   United States jurisdiction over certain lands in Evansville on
                                   which to erect public buildings, with a verbal recommendation
                                   that it do pass, but he withheld it till it shall be presented
                                   with a written report.
                         
                         
                         
                              THE DIVORCE LAW.
                              Mr. HALL, from the Committee on Rights and Privileges of
                                        the Inhabitants of the State, reported back the
                                   memorial of the yearly meeting of the Society of Friends, on the
                                   subject of the divorce law, with a bill, whose passage was
                                   recommended. [The bill provides that divorces may be granted for
                                   the following causes: 1. Adultery. 2. Abandonment for three
                                   years. 3. Cruel and inhuman treatment of either party by the
                                   other.]
                              On motion the report was laid on the table.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS moved that the vote be reconsidered.
                              Mr. BROWN moved (ineffectually) to lay the motion on the table.
                              The motion to reconsider prevailed, and the motion to lay the
                                   report on the table was lost.
                              The report of the committee was then concurred in.
                         
                         
                              CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION.
                              Mr. GREGG introduced a bill [S. 142] providing for getting the
                                   sense of the qualified voters of the State on the calling of a
                                   committee to alter or amend the constitution of the State, the
                                   vote to be taken on the first Tuesday in October, 1874, which was
                                   read the first time and passed to the second reading.
                         
                         
                              WABASH AND ERIE CANAL.
                              On motion by Mr. BROWN, the order of business was suspended and the
                                   joint resolution [H. R. 2] agreeing to and adopting an amendment
                                   to the constitution, by adding to the tenth article a section in
                                   relation to the debt charged upon the Wabash and Erie Canal,
                                   prohibiting the recognition by the General Assembly of any
                                   liability on the part of the State to pay the canal certificates
                                   issued under the provisions of the Butler bill, was taken up.
                              Mr. DAGGY made an ineffectual motion to lay the resolution on the
                                   table--yeas 5, nays 30.
                              Mr. DAGGY was in favor of the passage of the joint resolution in a
                                   certain contingency. If the Legislature should call a
                                   Constitutional Convention, it would be necessary, and if the
                                   Legislature should agree to propose several other necessary
                                   amendments to the Constitution this one should he stopped just
                                   where it is. He opposed the adoption of the resolution for the
                                   simple reason that, if adopted, it would preclude the
                                   presentation of any other amendments. He was in favor of the
                                   adoption of an amendment of the character of that proposed by the
                                   resolution, but there were other important amendments to the
                                   Constitution required, and he wanted them all embodied in a
                                   series so that they might be acted on by the people at once.
                              Mr. BROWN said he, for one, was not willing to take the
                                   responsibility of delaying action on the adoption of this
                                   resolution any longer. The Senate had passed a bill which would
                                   be made a pretext on the part of the holders of the canal scrip
                                   for their payment in full. Hence prompt action was necessary on
                                   the part of the General Assembly to give the people an
                                   opportunity to say conclusively and for all time that neither
                                   they nor their successors should be pestered with this vexatious
                                   question any longer. If the programme of the Senator from Putnam
                                   [Mr. Daggy] was adopted, it would take three or four years to
                                   pass it, whereas if the Senate adopted this resolution now, it
                                   could be passed within the next thirty or forty days, and the
                                   matter would be settled forever.
                              Mr. GOODING did not understand that anybody on the floor of the
                                   Senate was opposed to the resolution, but he concurred with the
                                   Senator from Putnam (Mr. Daggy) in believing that there were
                                   other important amendments to the constitution required, and if
                                   this resolution was passed constitutional restriction would
                                   prevent all further amendments for several years, except through
                                   the medium of a constitutional convention. For this reason he
                                   deprecated hasty action on the resolution at this time, and moved
                                   that the resolution be made the special order for next Wednesday
                                   at two o'clock p. m.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS thought if the resolutions were passed at once, the
                                   Governor could order a special election, and it might be over
                                   before the close of the present session. That would leave the way
                                   open to propose as many amendments at the next session as may be
                                   desired.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved to lay Mr. Gooding's motion on the
                                   table.
                              The motion was agreed to.Mr. DW1GGINS then demanded the previous
                                   question on the adoption of the resolution.
                              The demand was seconded by the Senate and under its operation the
                                   joint resolution was finally passed by yeas 35, nays 0.
                         
                         
                              STATIONERY.
                              Mr. GREGG offered a resolution which was adopted to furnish the
                                   President's Secretary with the name stationery as is and
                                   may be allowed to members.
                         
                         
                              NEW BILLS.
                              Mr. STEELE, by leave, introduced a bill [S. 143] for an act to
                                   restrain all per- sons under
                                   twenty-one years of age from making, assisting in making, vending
                                   or giving away intoxicating liquors in this State, which was read
                                   the first time and passed to the second reading.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN introduced a bill [S. 146] for an act to amend
                                   section four of the plank and gravel road assessment act, which
                                   was read the first time and passed to the second reading.
                              A motion to adjourn being made, and the yeas and nays demanded the
                                   vote resulted--yeas 9, nays 14.
                              No quorum voting--
                              Mr. HALL moved that the doorkeeper be sent for absentees--pending
                                   which--
                              The Senate adjourned till to-morrow at 10 o'clock.

                              MONDAY, December 9, 1872.
                         
                         The House met at 2 o'clock, p. m., pursuant to adjournment.
                         On motion of Mr. LENFESTY, the reading of the journal of yesterday was
                              dispensed with.
                         Mr. EDWARDS, of Lawrence, from the Committee on
                                   Elections, reported satisfaction that every member on
                              the roll of the House of Representatives has been duly elected.
                         The report was concurred in by unanimous consent.
                         
                              REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                              Mr. WALKER, from the Judiciary Committee,
                                   reported the bill [H. R. 131] for the prevention of cruelty to
                                   animals, recommending its indefinite postponement, and reporting
                                   a substitute therefor--viz.: A bill [ H. R. 212 ] for an act
                                   providing against cruelty to animals, and providing punishment
                                   therefor.
                              The report was concurred in and the substitute passed to the second
                                   reading.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, from the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary, returned Mr. Kimball's bill
                                   [H. R 190] to amend sections 25 and 26 of the act regulating
                                   descents, and the apportionment of estates, approved May 14,
                                   1852, recommending that it be indefinitely postponed, and
                                   reporting a substitute therefor, viz: a bill [H. R. 213] with
                                   similar title, recommending its passage.
                              Mr. WILSON of Ripley said the law now standing provides that where
                                   the husband or wife dies intestate, leaving no father, mother, or
                                   child, the whole shall descend to the survivor. The original bill
                                   provides in such cases that one-half of the property should go to
                                   the deceased party's heirs, and the other to the wife,
                                   provided the estate does not exceed $1,000. The committee raise
                                   this amount to $10,000. The present law is liable to objection,
                                   because if the husband dies leaving $100,000, having neither
                                   father, mother or child, the estate goes wholly to the wife--goes
                                   entirely into the family of a stranger to the husband's
                                   blood.
                              The substitute was passed to a second reading.
                              On motion of Mr. W. the substitute was laid on the table, and it
                                   was ordered that 200 copies thereof be printed.
                              Mr. W. also returned Mr. Pfrimmer's bill [H. R. 202] to
                                   amend the coroner's act of 1858] recommending its
                                   indefinite postponement.
                              Mr. BUSKIRK. The bill provides that where a physician is called to
                                   attend a coroner's inquest in no case shall he receive
                                   more than $10 for his services. To this the committee submit
                                   their adverse report; and, accordingly, the bill was indefinitely
                                   postponed.
                         
                         
                              WIFE-WHIPPING A FELONY.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, returned Mr. Kimball's bill [H. R.
                                   132] defining wife-whipping and prescribing punishment therefor,
                                   recommending that it be indefinitely postponed, and expressing
                                   the opinion that there is ample punishment for this oftence
                                   already provided by law.
                              
                              Mr. KIMBALL. It seems to me that the present legal penalty for
                                   assault and battery is not sufficient for this offence, and I
                                   trust in the goodheartedness of members for their votes on this
                                   bill. I know the law should be more strict than it is. In the
                                   county of Marion there are numerous offences of this kind that
                                   are passed over too lightly or disregarded altogether. And I have
                                   a letter from the county of Bartholomew alleging a number of
                                   cases there, which the penalty for assault and battery
                                   can't restrain, and the result is the separation of the
                                   parties. So, if you punish this offence adequately the courts
                                   will not be burdened with applications for divorce. I think
                                   members ought to vote for this bill, especially those who are
                                   expecting to get wives; and if all such do not vote for it they
                                   ought to be obliged to remain bachelors all the days of their
                                   life.
                              Mr. SMITH proposed to amend by inserting the words: "No
                                   man shall be allowed to whip his wife unless she needs
                                   it."
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley. Gentlemen should not confound the
                                   administration of the law with the law itself. The law now
                                   provides fine and imprisonment for this effense; but this bill
                                   makes it a felony. Under this bill there would be no alternative
                                   but the offender must go to the penitentiary. We can't
                                   legislate perfectly with reference to moral conduct. But I do not
                                   see why it should be a greater offense for a man to whip his own
                                   wife, than to whip his neighbor's wife, or for the wife
                                   to whip her husband. And there are extenuating circumstances. A
                                   man may be guilty of assault and battery, and yet it may be that
                                   he should not go to the penitentiary. The Committee considered
                                   that a fine and six months' imprisonment might suffice
                                   for an offense so simple as that of assault and battery.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred where a man
                                   whips his wife he ought to go to the penitentiary; and if we
                                   could go back, I would be glad to amend the bill so that none
                                   shall whip another's wife. But there need be no law to
                                   forbid the wife from whipping her husband, for that is never done
                                   unless he deserves it.
                              Mr. MILLER. It seems to me that reasoning in the report is
                                   sufficient--and that is, that the law as it now stands provides
                                   ample punishment. The law prescribes a fine of a thousand dollars
                                   and imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year. Now
                                   if the punishment was more severe than it is, the law could not
                                   be enforced. Again, the wife commonly must be the informer; and
                                   if she knew that the law would take her husband away so long she
                                   would never inform on him. Better to have the law reasonable, and
                                   leave a discretion as to the punishment to the court and jury.
                                   But the law is abused. Sometimes, for this offense, a justice
                                   will fine one dollar and costs. It might be a wipe provision of
                                   law, that the offender should not be fined less than $25, and to
                                   make the least grade of imprisonment one year. But, after all,
                                   perhaps the best way to protect the wives would be to make a good
                                   temperance law; for it will be seen that, even in Marion county,
                                   very few whip their wives unless they are drunk.
                              Mr. BUSKIRK. This debate is assuming something of our school boy
                                   days, when we had the question: Which is the greater calamity, a
                                   smoking chimney or a scolding wife? I think it would evidently be
                                   a greater misfortune to the wife to be whipped, than to have her
                                   husband sent to the penitentiary. But this bill would send the
                                   villain to the penitentiary for his declaration of intention to
                                   whip. Seriously: the present legal penalties are severe enough,
                                   the remedy is not to be found in severer enactmennts.
                              Mr. BARRETT. I do not know but it is a fair bill, but I do not want
                                   the House to understand that there are so many cases of
                                   wife-whipping in my county.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. I wish to set myself right before the House so far as
                                   Bartholomew county is concerned. [He produced and read the letter
                                   referred to, dated at Elizabethtown, addressed to Mr. K.,
                                   expressing a liking for his bill (H. R. 132), and praying for its
                                   passage, and stating that they have six wife-beaters living in
                                   that town; that one of them has been prosecuted before a justice
                                   of the peace, and he got off so easily that his wife would not
                                   live with him after; another man, etc.]
                              Mr. BARRETT. Elizabethtown is so near the county line that I am
                                   inclined to think that a part of that business must have been
                                   done in Jennings county.
                              Mr. WALKER, The gentleman from Marion says the operation of this
                                   bill will discourage applications for divorce. But I would ask
                                   that gentleman, soberly: are you willing to place it in the power
                                   of the wife, by her own testimony, to put her husband into the
                                   penitentiary, and thereby obtain a legal cause for divorce? She
                                   has but to swear that her husband has whipped her, and put him
                                   into the penitentiary. That, to my mind, is a serious thing--too
                                   much power to trust in her hands.
                              
                              The bill was indefinitely postponed--yeas 47, nays 30.
                         
                         
                              REFUNDING TAXES.
                              Mr. MILLER, from the Judiciary Committee,
                                   reported back Mr. Richardson's bill [H. R. 157]
                                   authorizing the refunding of taxes collected in 1869 and 1870 on
                                   erroneous assessments of 1869, with a recommendation that it be
                                   indefinitely postponed.
                              On motion of Mr. OFFUTT, the report was laid upon the table to
                                   await the return of the author of the bill.
                              Mr. JOHNSON returned his bill [H. R. 112] to render wives competent
                                   to testify in actions brought for injury done to them, with an
                                   amendment inserting appropriately these words: "To the
                                   person or character of," so as to read, "For
                                   injuries done to the person or character of the wife."
                                   The amendment was adopted, and so the bill was ordered to the
                                   engrossment.

                                   passage. He also returned Mr. Billingsley's bill [H. R.
                                   133] prescribing the time for transacting road business by County

                                   to pass. It would affect but few counties, and it might be
                                   applied very beneficially to some, as in the gentleman's
                                   [Mr. Rumsey's] county, where such undedicated grounds

                                   calender.
                              Mr. CLARK submitted a resolution that the Judiciary
                                        Committee inquire into the expediency of
                                   abolishing the death penalty in this State, and substuting there
                                   or imprisonment at hard labor for life, and report, etc. It was
                                   rejected, but subsequently the vote was reconsidered, and the
                                   resolution referred to the Committee on the

                                   resolution No. 2, in relation to the two per cent. claims of
                                   Ohio, Indiana and Missouri, now pending before Congress, on the
                                   sale of the public lands and reservations--instructing and
                                   requesting Congressmen to vote for the passage of the bill.
                              It was adopted on the part of the House of Representatives--yeas,
                                   70; nays, 0.
                         
                         
                              UNSURRENDERED STATE BONDS.
                              The SPEAKER took up and announced the consideration of the bill [S.
                                   85] to provide for the payment of sundry bonds or stocks of the
                                   State, issued prior to the year 1841 (to the extent of 191
                                   bonds), on the first reading.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. Seeing that it is similar to the bill of the House,
                                   which is made the special order for to-morrow, I move to suspend
                                   the restrictions that it may be advanced and considered at the
                                   same time.
                              The motion was agreed to by yeas and nays, and the order made
                                   accordingly.
                              The House then adjourned.

                         IN SENATE.
                         
                              TUESDAY, December 10, 1872.
                         
                         The Senate met at 10 o'clock, a. m., pursuant to
                              adjournment.
                         On motion of Mr. ORR the reading of the journal was dispensed with.
                         Mr. THOMPSON presented a petition for a rigid temperance law, which was
                              referred to the Committee on Temperance.
                         
                              RAILROAD TARIFF.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS called up the special order for this hour, being the
                                   bill [S. 6] to fix the freight and passenger tariff for railroads
                                   doing business in this State; and also the bill [S. 115] to
                                   prevent extortionate charges for and unjust discriminations by
                                   railroad companies and other common carriers in this State. The
                                   first named bill having been read the second time
                                   heretofore--bill [S. 115] was read the second time so that both
                                   bills may be considered on the same reading.
                              Mr. BROWN said it enforces the rights of the people against common
                                   carriers, and that is all there is in it.
                              The Senate refused to lay the bill on the table.
                              Mr. SCOTT thought that the title of the bill [S. 6] should be
                                   changed to something like this: "A bill to provide for
                                   making law suits between the people and railroad corporations and
                                   other common carriers in this State." A law might as
                                   well be passed proposing to regulate the price of labor and the
                                   price of meat. The principle of the bill is wrong, for whenever
                                   the price of carrying is higher than the people can afford, the
                                   carrying will be done by horses or oxen, or the evil will be
                                   corrected in some other way. The bill proposes an innovation in
                                   the practice in this State, and an entire change, involving too
                                   much risk to the industry and progress of this State. He moved
                                   that the bill [S. 115] be printed.
                              Mr. ORR hoped the bill would pass, but desired to see it
                                   printed.
                              Mr. HOUGH opposed the motion to print, because he should oppose the
                                   passage of the bill.
                              Mr. NEFF was confident there is no wrong demanding a remedy more
                                   impperatively than this thing of the freight and passenger
                                   charges of railroad companies.
                              Mr. BROWN thought Governor Baker was a pretty good lawyer. His
                                   excellency put in about three weeks in getting up this bill. But
                                   it seems that it strikes at these tender plants--these railroad
                                   companiesthat we ought not to put our hands upon it at all. The
                                   bill [S. 6] is a bill of doubtful constitutional character, and
                                   no lawyer that has examined it but has expressed grave and
                                   doubtful question as to whether it could be upheld in the courts
                                   of justice.
                              Mr. ROSEBRUGH regarded Governor Baker as one of the best lawyers in
                                   the State, and would be very slow to object to a bill proposed by
                                   his excellency without careful consideration of its provisions.
                                   He was for every reform measure before this Legislature, and
                                   thought it important that this General Assembly should give early
                                   consideration to all such propositions. Especially should an
                                   effort be made to regulate
                                   railroad charges in this State at an early day; and for the
                                   reason that it would delay the consideration of this bill, he
                                   opposed the motion to print.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. HARNEY urged careful consideration of this matter, and desired
                                   to avoid hasty legislation in the consideration of this as well
                                   as every other measure that comes before the General Assembly. A
                                   railroad should not charge more from any competing station, or
                                   from the terminus of the road, than from or between any
                                   interimediate point or points on the road. The origin of one
                                   third of the railroads now proposed to be built arose from a
                                   desire to make important towns competing points.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS explained the provisions of the bill; cited instances
                                   of extortion in charges for the transportation of freights short
                                   distances in this State, and insisted that his bill [S. 6] would
                                   remedy this evil. The bill did not attempt to control the rates
                                   of charges for through rates.
                              Mr. WADGE was in favor of any action that will protect the people
                                   against monopolies. But it is a question whether this bill would
                                   not injure the people, for if it should be impossible for
                                   railroads to furnish transportation between local stations, of
                                   course the people would be injured by being deprived of railroad
                                   facilities. He had taken pains to furnish himself with some facts
                                   and figures on this subject, which he recited.
                              Mr. HALL referred to the Ohio and New York laws on this subject,
                                   but his remarks were not heard at the reporter's
                                   desk.
                              Mr. SCOTT moved to make the bill of Senator Brown [S. 115] the
                                   special order for Friday at ten o'clock.
                              Mr. STEELE moved to amend by including in the special order the
                                   bill of Senator Williams [S. 6].
                              A long debate ensued, not only upon the question, but running off
                                   into desultory discussions as to the merits of the two bills, and
                                   the subject of railroad legislation generally.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS moved (ineffectually) to lay the amendment upon the
                                   table.
                              The question being upon Mr. Steele's motion, the yeas and
                                   nays were demanded and the vote resulted--yeas 23, nays 20.
                              Mr. BROWN moved to make the bill [S. 6] a special order for
                                   Thursday.
                              The PRESIDENT ruled that the motion was not in order.
                              Mr. BROWN then moved to amend the pending question by making the
                                   bill [S. 115] a special order for Thursday.
                              The PRESIDENT ruled that this motion was also out of order, and a
                                   debate followed on rules of order.
                              The motion of Mr. Scott, as amended by Mr. Steele, to make the two
                                   bills a special order for Friday, was then rejected--yeas 16,
                                   nays 26.
                              Mr. BROWN moved to make the bill [S. 6] a special order for
                                   Thursday morning.
                              Mr. STEELE moved to make the bill [S. 115] a special order for the
                                   same hour.
                              Mr. BROWN moved to table the amendment.
                              It was agreed to--yeas 37, nays 4.
                              Mr. OLIVER moved to adjourn.
                              The yeas and nays were demanded, and Mr. Oliver withdrew the
                                   motion.
                              Mr. HOUGH moved to make the bill a special order for Thursday at
                                   two p. m.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS moved to lay the motion on the table.
                              The motion was agreed to.The original motion to make the bill the
                                   special order for Thursday morning was then put and carried.
                              Mr. ORR moved that bill 115 be made the special order for Thursday
                                   at two p. m.
                              This motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. OLIVER renewed his resolution to adjourn, which was agreed to,
                                   and so the Senate adjourned till two p. m.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The Senate met pursuant to adjournment.
                         
                         
                              THE DRAINAGE LAWS.
                              The PRESIDENT announced the special order for the hour being Mr.
                                   Dwiggins' bill [S. 1] for an act to repeal an act
                                   entitled an act to authorize and encourage the erection of
                                   levees, dykes and drains, and the reclamation of wet and
                                   overflowed lands by incorporated companies, and to repeal all
                                   former laws relating to the same subject, which went into effect
                                   without executive approval, May 22, 1869; also an act to repeal
                                   an act supplemental thereto, approved February 23, 1871. The bill
                                   being on the second reading--
                              Mr. BROWN said he was in favor of the bill. He had all along been
                                   in favor of a fair draining law, but the end of the session was
                                   appoaching and he would rather have no bill at all than that one
                                   now in force. He should, therefore, favor the passage of the bill
                                   and hereafter legislation can be had which would give the State a
                                   good substantial draining law. Relying upon the professions of
                                   Senators from the northern part of the State that they will favor
                                   the enactment of a just drainage law, he would favor the passage of this repealing
                                   bill, and therefore moved that it be considered as engrossed and
                                   read the third time now. But he withheld this motion for the
                                   present.
                              Mr. BOONE opposed the unconditional repeal of the drainage law of
                                   1869. To repeal all drainage laws without a saving clause would
                                   work great injustice to many, and parties interested in a large
                                   amount of work in his county alone would be without a remedy in
                                   the courts. If their remedy in courts of justice is destroyed it
                                   is doubtful whether a new act would enable such persons to
                                   recover the rights they now have. He regarded the Chapman bill
                                   [S. 68] as being better than any bill on the subject that has
                                   ever yet been on the statute book, and hoped to see it passed.
                                   There were several lines of drains in Boone and Hendricks
                                   counties yet unfinished, and which would never be finished if the
                                   draining laws were repealed. He protested therefore against the
                                   repeal of these acts unless a new draining law was passed to take
                                   their place.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE offered the following amendment:
                              Amend section 2 by adding thereto the following words:
                                   "Provided that the existence and the rights, franchises
                                   and powers of all incorporated companies organized under said
                                   acts, or under any prior law of this State, repealed by said
                                   acts, the main line of whose contemplated work does not exceed
                                   ten miles in length, shall be saved, unimpaired and unaffected by
                                   this repealing act.
                              Mr. ORR favored the amendment.
                              Mr. SLATER would prefer seeing the Chapman bill passed before the
                                   bill under consideration shall be acted favorably upon.
                              Mr. WADGE desired to see this bill go through without any
                                   amendment. He had presented a petition here from twelve hundred
                                   citizens in his district praying for the unconditional repeal of
                                   the present drainage laws, and though he should vote for the
                                   amendment, it would be under protest, believing that the entire
                                   law should be swept from the statute book.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN, in order to do justice to his own
                                   constituents, who are interested in ditches with main lines more
                                   than ten miles long, offered the following amendment: Strike out
                                   "ten" and insert "sixteen."
                                   He did this in a spirit of compromise and concession. It is all
                                   wrong to give corporations unlimited power and control over real
                                   estate by reason of their assessments.
                              Mr. BOONE thought the amendment was not sufficient and would not
                                   provide for a remedy to parties aggrieved by the bill.
                              Mr. WADGE could pledge the support of Senators from the northern
                                   portion of the State for the Chapman bill, but the urgencies are
                                   so great that he asked the early passage of the pending bill.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN believed that the assessments should in no
                                   case exceed the actual cost of the improvement.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE accepted the amendment.
                              Mr. HUBBARD offered the amendment saying that if the bill was
                                   passed to repeal the act they would look out for themselves as
                                   against any claims of the Kankakee Draining Company on account of
                                   vested rights.
                              Mr. BOONE desired the repeal of the thirteenth section of the law
                                   of 1869 and the entire law of 1871.
                              The amendment as amended was agreed to by yeas 37, nays 7.
                              On motion of Mr. DWIGGINS, the bill was considered as engrossed and
                                   read the third time.
                              The question being on the passage off the bill--
                              Mr. DWIGGINS said he wished to correct an impression that had gone
                                   abroad that the Kankakee valley was an impassable morass, and
                                   ought to be drained as a sanitary measure. This was not now true.
                                   For the last two years the greater part of the Kankakee marsh had
                                   been in such a condition that a mowing machine could be run over
                                   it, and therefore could not have been a serious detriment to the
                                   public health. He urged the passage of the bill which repealed
                                   the acts of 1869 and 1871. It was true that he and other Senators
                                   from the Kankakee valley voted for supplemental act of 1871, but
                                   it was simply because they found that they could not then procure
                                   the defeat of the act of 1869, and they thought the act of 1871
                                   would mitigate the evils suffered under the act of 1869. Now,
                                   however, they were in favor of the unconditional repeal of both
                                   acts.
                              Mr. BOONE said he should vote against the bill. It would not cost
                                   the citizens of his county less than one thousand dollars to
                                   determine the questions that would be raised by the unconditional
                                   repeal of the present law.
                              Mr. SLATER said: I hope the Senator from Boone (Mr. Boone), in the
                                   magnanimity of his nature, will withdraw his opposition. It is
                                   evident that the loyal and patriotic denizens of Jasper, Pulaski,
                                   Benton, White, and other classic lowlands of the northwest, have
                                   been terribly outraged, and are now suffering manifold indignities from the
                                   encroachments of the Kankakee Draining Company. It has robbed
                                   them, not of their historic cascades and waterfalls, nor of their
                                   murmuring brooks "that gush forth in the midst of
                                   roses," but it has robbed them of their lowland sloughs
                                   and shimmering lakes that have rested on their bosom for ages
                                   like dazzling breast-pins upon the bosom of the landscape. Fish,
                                   frog and other animalculae of the aqueous element--that great
                                   propagator of brain power--which has shown such beneficent
                                   results upon the adults of that latitude, can now no longer be
                                   acquired as a food for the intellectual development of the rising
                                   generation. The melody of the sonorous bullfrog no longer lulls
                                   into the land of dreams the infantile prodigies of the Senator
                                   from Jasper. Frog's hams are a choice dish to the
                                   fastidious Frenchman, and who knows but their constituents, or
                                   even the Senators from Jasper and St. Joseph themselves are the
                                   noble scions of some doughty warrior who fell at the bridge of
                                   Lodi under the Old Napoleon, and has inherited a voracious and
                                   insatiate appetite for the posterior pedals of the sonorous bull
                                   frog. This draining law, under the operation of the Kankakee
                                   Draining Company, have robbed the people of Jasper of their bogs
                                   and marshes, their sloughs and bull-frogs, without which they are
                                   destitute of any primeval history, and in the event of no relief,
                                   the Senators from Jasper and St. Joseph would represent a
                                   constituency whose history had been sent
                                   "kiting" down the twilight shades of dire
                                   oblivion.
                              Mr. HOUGH agreed with Mr. Boone. He feared that the repeal of the
                                   law would imperil the vested rights of men in other parts of the
                                   State than in the Kankakee Valley, who had acted honestly, and
                                   whose work had been of great benefit to the localities where it
                                   was done. He also opposed the bill, because there are too many
                                   interests bound up in this bill detrimental to many of his
                                   constituents. Unless an amendment were made to this bill such as
                                   he suggested he would not stand by and see it passed without
                                   entering a protest.
                              The bill then passed the Senate by yeas, 42; nays, 3.
                              On motion by Mr. STEELE, the title was amended by adding the words,
                                   "and having the rights therein mentioned."
                              The PRESIDENT pro tem. (Mr. Williams in the Chair) announced
                                   another special order for this hour, being Mr. Chapman's
                                   bill [S. 88] to authorize the construction of levees, dykes,
                                   drains and ditches, and the reclamation of wet and overflowed
                                   lands by incorporated associations, and providing for the
                                   organization of such associations.
                              [The bill provides that any number of persons, not less than five,
                                   may associate themselves together for the construction of levees,
                                   dykes and drains, and the reclamation of wet and overflowed
                                   lands, of which any person may become a member by signing the
                                   articles of association. Before commencing the contemplated work
                                   the Board of Directors shall cause a survey to be made and a full
                                   description of the proposed improvement, which shall be open at
                                   all times to public inspection. The appraisers shall be appointed
                                   by the County Commissioners, and all persons whose lands will be
                                   affected by the proposed improvement shall be served with notice
                                   of the time and pla'ce where the Appraisers will begin
                                   the examination and assessment of lands. After the assessment is
                                   made, a printed notice shall be posted in not less than five
                                   public places in each township through which the work extends of
                                   the time and place, when and where the appraisers will meet to
                                   equalize their assessments. The assessments, when perfected and
                                   completed, shall be a lien on the lands assessed, provided that
                                   if the assessments of benefits do not equal the estimated cost of
                                   the work and the damages assessed and 10 per cent. of the whole
                                   amount in addition thereto, the work of the association shall not
                                   be further prosecuted. Any person feeling aggrieved by the
                                   assessment upon his lands may take an appeal to the Circuit Court
                                   or Common Pleas. If the work shall exceed five miles in length,
                                   it shall be let by the Board of Directors to the lowest
                                   responsible bidder. Otherwise it may be let by contract or done
                                   as the Board may deem best, Any person through whose lands the
                                   proposed work may pass shall be entitled to do so much of it as
                                   is upon his land, provided that he shall make application within
                                   twenty days after the filing of the assessment and will do it on
                                   equally resonable terms with those offered by any one else. The
                                   Board of Directors shall have power to collect only so much of
                                   the assessment as shall be necessary for the construction of the
                                   work and its protection and repair and to defray the necessary
                                   expenses of the association. The members of the association shall
                                   be individually liable for all debts contracted by and all
                                   damages assessed against the association during their membership.
                                   The bill repeals the act of 1869: provided, that the rights,
                                   franchises and powers of all companies organized under that act,
                                   the main line of whose work does not exceed twenty miles in length, shall not
                                   be impaired by the repeal.]
                              Mr. DITTEMORE moved to postpone its further consideration till
                                   Friday at two o'clock.
                              On motion this motion was laid on the table.
                              The bill was read through the second time by the Secretary, as was
                                   also the amendments proposed by the Committee on
                                        Corporations.
                              [The Committee on Corporations recommended
                                   several amendments, one of which provides that the work shall not
                                   be commenced until one-third of the resident land-holders whose
                                   lands are to be affected thereby shall have petitioned for the
                                   appointment of the appraisers.]
                              Mr. DAGGY moved to amend the amendment proposed by the committee to
                                   section 13, by requiring the consent of the majority of the
                                   resident land owners interested in the construction of a drain,
                                   instead of one-third, before appraisers shall be appointed.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN thought in many cases the amendment proposed
                                   would be equivalent to stopping the work proposed. If the drain
                                   was a considerable length, where the average fall would not be
                                   more than three or four feet to the mile, a majority might be
                                   obtained, but in another case, such as he stated, it is not
                                   probable that more than one-third interested could be found
                                   willing to petition for appraisers.
                              Mr. BOONE opposed the amendment. He said that in many cases persons
                                   owning wet lands could not find an outlet for the surplus water
                                   without passing through the lands of others whose lands would not
                                   be benefited by the drain, and who, therefore, would not join in
                                   the petition, and thus the former might be deprived of the
                                   benefit of the act.
                              Mr. STEELE took the same view of the case.
                              Mr. WADGE favored the amendment. A majority ought to have control
                                   in such matters. It puts the matter where it rightly belongs.
                              Mr. ROSEBRUGH insisted that the doctrine that the majority shall
                                   rule is so completely an American principle, it should certainly
                                   be adopted in this case.
                              Mr. HUBBARD thought it no more than right that a majority should
                                   sign the petition for the appointment of appraisers, and could
                                   not see how this proposition can be objected to. It is contrary
                                   to the spirit of our laws and institutions that a minority should
                                   force the majority into the adoption of any measure.
                              Mr. SCOTT thought there should be an amendment including only
                                   persons within the limits of the water line of the proposed
                                   drain--persons owning land above the summit.
                              Mr. HOUGH was of the opinion that neither the amendment, nor the
                                   amendment to the amendment, was desirable, but that the bill as
                                   it is affords ample protection.
                              Mr. DAGGY modified his amendment by adding the words
                                   "liable to he assessed for benefits."
                              Pending which--

                              TUESDAY, December 10, 1872.
                         
                         The House met at nine o'clock.
                         On motion of Mr. McCONNELL, the reading of the journal of yesterday was
                              dispensed with.
                         
                              THE WABASH CANAL MATTER.
                              The SPEAKER announced the special order, viz.: the consideration of
                                   Mr. Kimball's bill [H. R. 129] and the bill [S. 83] to
                                   protect the Wabash and Erie Canal.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN moved that Mr. Kimball's bill [H. R. 129] be
                                   laid on the table, the Senate bill having provisions more
                                   acceptable to all parties.
                              Mr. KIMBALL seconded the motion.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY moved to recommit Mr. Kimball's bill to the
                                        Committee on Ways and Means, with
                                   instructions to add a section discriminating and providing
                                   against the payment of any bonds or stocks not declared to be a
                                   lien on the canal. He wished by this to protect the interests of
                                   the people as far as possible. There are two classes of these
                                   bonds: a certain class that are a lien on the canal, and another
                                   class that are not. The payment of the latter class should not be
                                   contemplated in this bill. He was not willing to undo now what
                                   was settled under the Butler bills--not willing to do now what
                                   the people in 1847 declared they would not do. He was not willing
                                   that what is not declared to be a lien on the canal should be
                                   paid by this bill.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. This was unnecessary. The committee had already
                                   disregarded similar instructions. He was opposed to making any
                                   discrimination between these bonds, for he would not sanction
                                   repudiation, and the idea of the amendment in that you will
                                   repudiate certain of these bonds. He moved to lay the bill and
                                   the motion to recommit on the table.
                              Mr. RICHARDSON demanded a division of the question, so by yeas and
                                   nays the motion to recommit was tabled first, and then Mr.
                                   Kimball's bill [H. R. 124] was laid on the table--yeas
                                   81, nays 1.
                              The SPEAKER. The question is on the third reading and passage of
                                   the bill [S. 83] to provide for certain bonds or stocks of the
                                   State issued prior to 1841, and tit was read the third time by
                                   the clerk.
                              Mr. BOWSER proposed a resolution. That the trustees of the Wabash
                                   and Erie Canal be instructed to appeal the case in the Cass
                                   Circuit Court, which resulted in the Garrett judgment, to the
                                   Supreme Court, to employ counsel, and pledging the State to pay
                                   costs and fees therein.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. We have no power over these trustees. We
                                   can't instruct them to appeal, and they won't
                                   appeal. We can gain nothing by such instructions. It is only
                                   making delay. The session is coming to a close. The 27th of this
                                   month is the last day of grace, and the House should not delay
                                   this matter an hour longer. If any one was opposed to the bill,
                                   he wanted him to declare that opposition openly, and not cover it
                                   up under the pretext offered by this proposition for delay.
                              
                              Mr. OFFUTT differed with the gentleman from Marion as to the power
                                   of these trustees. One of these trustees is appointed by the
                                   State, and under instructions here he might appeal. There is a
                                   difference of opinion among legal men of the State as to the
                                   State's liability; and considering the majority of the
                                   people are opposed to the passage of this bill, it would be time
                                   enough to pay those bonds after the court of final resort shall
                                   have determined the question.
                              Mr. GREGORY thought there was a wide difference of opinion as to
                                   the State's liability. He especially cited the opinion
                                   of the Hon. Daniel D. Pratt, that, under the provisions of the
                                   Butler bill we are not called upon to pay any part of those bonds
                                   or stocks adjusted under the Butler bills.He was satisfied that
                                   the canal trustees would acquiesce in an order to carry this
                                   matter to the Supreme Court.
                              Mr. PEED thought this a matter of too great importance for hasty
                                   action, and that it should go to the Supreme Court. The
                                   settlement of the internal improvement debt under the Butler bill
                                   was a final one. The parties accepted the canal subject to all
                                   the liens. If we have taken no advantage of them it is no
                                   business of ours. Let them settle with their creditors They have
                                   never carried out their obligations. We should require them to
                                   come in and show clean hands. The legal questions involved are
                                   grave ones--the whole subject is involved in doubt; and the
                                   people should be given the benefit of that doubt. He was
                                   satisfied that the people were opposed to this bill, and that his
                                   vote against it would be in accordance with the wishes of his
                                   constituents. It was his conviction that by paying this portion
                                   of the indebtedness of this canal, we would be paving the way for
                                   the payment of the entire debt of the State under the old
                                   internal improvement system.
                              Mr. KIMBALL did not want to appear before the House too often. The
                                   point aimed at by this amendment is that this matter may be
                                   delayed. The State can not be made a party to this suit without
                                   delay, for which there is no occasion at all. He urged the
                                   justice of the case of the bondholders contemplated in this bill,
                                   and to deny it by legislation would be to attempt to make that
                                   law which contravenes the Constitution of the United States. For
                                   two years the subject matter which the resolution aimed to place
                                   before the people had been discussed by them. He wanted, in
                                   determining this question, to lose sight of all party feeling.
                                   Part of the debt has been paid, and part has not been paid. It is
                                   argued by some that the payment of these bonds will be a
                                   violation of the proviso of the Butler bill. They know that that
                                   proviso does not save the State as against those who refused to
                                   settle with the State under its provisions. This is no argument
                                   in favor of postponement And he referred to the published opinion
                                   of Hendricks, Hord & Hendricks, distinguished lawyers
                                   employed in behalf of the State, to the effect that the
                                   provisions of the Butler bill do not save the State from the
                                   payment of these unsurrendered bonds. The opinion of these
                                   gentlemen may be relied upon; their argument went out to the
                                   country two years ago, and it is conclusive against the proposed
                                   amendment.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, confessed to having had difficulty in
                                   determining this question; but he was satisfied of his duty to
                                   protect this bill against any motion to postpone. Gentlemen talk
                                   about a contract. Were the holders of these bonds parties to that
                                   contract? It requires two parties to make a contract, and were
                                   the holders of these bonds parties to that contract? He read from
                                   one of these bonds to show that the faith of the State of Indiana
                                   was irrevocably pledged for the payment of them. In opposition to
                                   those who urge that this case be appealed to the Supreme Court,
                                   he alleged that it is the first duty of members of this General
                                   Assembly to determine what the law is, just as much as it is the
                                   duty of the Supreme Court. The Legislature must determine this
                                   question of law for itself. If the canal is sold to pay this
                                   judgment, the State becomes liable for the payment of the whole
                                   canal debt. But he went upon higher ground. The faith of the
                                   State was pledged for the payment of these bonds, and anything
                                   short of that would be repudiation.
                              Mr. WALKER considered that the only question is, whether we will
                                   recommit this bill with the instructions. It had been remarked by
                                   the gentlemen from Morgan and Johnson that this question has not
                                   been before the people of the State. Two years ago there was no
                                   27th of December before us. If that had been before us, then this
                                   question could have been before the Supreme Court, and we might
                                   have their judgment now. But it was not invited then; and he
                                   asked if the proposition now to appeal this case did not look
                                   simply like delay; and could the State of Indiana afford this?
                                   Had the people complained of their Representatives because they
                                   refused to submit this question to the Court of final resort? He
                                   was op- posed to the
                                   amendment and moved to lay it on the table.
                              Mr. OFFUTT demanded the yeas and nays, and they were ordered and
                                   resulted--yeas, 76; nays, 14; so the motion to recommit was laid
                                   on the table and the question recurred on the passage of the
                                   bill.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY moved to recommit the bill with instructions to add a
                                   section that no bond or certificate of stock, or principal or
                                   interest thereon, shall be paid under this act, which is not
                                   declared a lien on the Wabash Canal conveyed under what is known
                                   us the Butler bills.
                              Mr. WALKER moved to lay this upon the table also, but withdrew the
                                   motion to give opportunity for debate.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY said that the only emergency was to provide for the
                                   bonds which are a lien upon the canal. He was pledged to his
                                   people to oppose any law providing for the payment of any bonds
                                   which are not a lien upon the canal. These bonds cost the holders
                                   not more than five per cent. If a refusal to pay these bonds was
                                   repudiation he cared not. During the canvass it had been charged
                                   against him that he desired to come here and pay the whole debt.
                                   On the contrary he was opposed to the payment of any part of
                                   it.
                              Mr. WALKER said the faith of the State was pledged for the payment
                                   of her outstanding bonds, and she could not afford to go before
                                   the money markets of the world and plead the baby act.
                              Mr. HENDERSON said that two years ago he did not hear a person
                                   express an opinion in favor of paying these bonds, nor did we
                                   hear anything in favor of it during the canvass. Let it go before
                                   the people again; let it form the question in the next canvass,
                                   and see who will return here. Let it be discussed openly. In his
                                   county it had only been discussed through a secret circular,
                                   charging the Democrats with a purpose to pay the debt.
                              Mr. HELLER said the House had passed an amendment to the
                                   constitution declaring the debt should not be paid, and now it is
                                   proposed to pass a law saying a part of it should be paid. The
                                   old bonds have not been so effectually canceled but that an
                                   expert can efface the cancellation marks, and again throw upon
                                   the market an un-lantity of old bonds. He exhibited one of the
                                   old bonds, and said he could produce a bag full in a little
                                   while. With this danger staring us in the face he felt that he
                                   would be safe to vote on the side of economy.
                              Mr. COWGILL thought there was no more direct way of making the
                                   State liable for the payment of the $20,000,000 of internal
                                   improvement bonds than the success of the course adopted by the
                                   opponents of this bill.
                              Mr. KIMBALL was sorry the gentleman from Morgan and Johnson (Mr.
                                   Shirley) had made this a party question. As a Republican, he
                                   would not make it a party question. Indiana had already purchased
                                   eight of the bonds it was proposed to repudiate, and derived a
                                   part of her school fund from the interest thereon. The General
                                   Government owned sixty seven of them, and Garrett had paid gold
                                   for his bonds. He could not vote to repudiate those obligations
                                   of the State.
                              Mr. WALKER said the argument was drifting away from the question to
                                   the general merits of the bill, he therefore renewed his motion
                                   to lay the motion of Mr. Shirley upon the table.
                              The motion to lay upon the table was agreed to--yeas 59, nays
                                   35.
                              Mr. OFFUTT moved to lay the bill on the table.
                              The motion was rejected; and the question recurred on the passage
                                   of the bill [S. 83.]
                              Mr. SHIRLEY said the gentleman from Marion [Mr. Kimball ] expressed
                                   regret that he had made this a party question. The Republican
                                   party has charged by secret circular that the Democrats were
                                   coming here to saddle the canal debt upon the people. The
                                   gentleman concedes that the State is only liable for 114 of these
                                   bonds, and yet asks me to sit here and make the State liable for
                                   the whole 191. They say we are honorably bound to pay them. I
                                   deny it. To carry out faith with his constituents, he would vote
                                   against the payment of one cent. He was not willing to go one
                                   step beyound the Butler bill.
                              Mr. SMITH was willing to go upon the record on the main issue. It
                                   was placed more upon the moral than upon a legal basis. Even in
                                   that aspect he thought it was against the bondholders. Good legal
                                   opinions had been offered on either bide. He was in favor of
                                   waiting and having the decision of the Supreme Court. The people
                                   have once decided this question against the bondholders, and he
                                   was opposed to reopening it. The argument that the bonds should
                                   be paid because the State is able to pay them is not a good one,
                                   neither was the argument that the selling of the canal would
                                   render the State liable for the payment of the canal debt. The
                                   holders of the canal took it with a full knowledge of its
                                   incumbrances; and even agreeing that the friends of this bill are
                                   right as to the question of the State's liability for
                                   the unsurrendered bonds, the owners of the canal can on- ly have recourse against
                                   her for the amount of the judgment recovered upon the bonds which
                                   remain a lien upon the canal. He deprecated the disposition to
                                   rush into extravagance, and much as he might desire to see the
                                   Republican party defeated, he did not wish that end should be
                                   accomplished though the means of its extravagance, as the people
                                   would in any event be the sufferers.
                              Mr. BUSKIRK was not alarmed by having this word
                                   "repudiation" thrust in his face. It was but a
                                   word after all, and words carry no weight except as they are
                                   considered in the light of circumstances. The gentlemen from
                                   Marion [Mr. Kimball] was himself guilty of repudiation in voting
                                   for the recently passed constitutional amendment. That meant
                                   nothing if it did not mean repudiation.
                              Mr. KIMBALL said he had voted for that amendment in order to
                                   prevent future payment of one-half of the debt which had been
                                   already paid.
                              Mr. BUSKIRK said the gentleman was right in so voting. He had voted
                                   that way himself, and in so voting they had both incurred the
                                   odium of repudiation. He believed the people were opposed to the
                                   payment of this debt, and if any odium was attached to the
                                   refusal to pay, it must revert to the people. If there had been
                                   any repudiation, it had been effected twenty-six years ago. This
                                   was an attempt at resurrection, not repudiation. Garrett had no
                                   moral claim superior to that of the holders of the canal
                                   certificates. The latter had come up to the help of the State in
                                   her extremity, while the former had not. If he believed the
                                   State, by refusing to pay these bonds and allowing the canal to
                                   be sold, would become liable for the old canal debt, he would
                                   support the bill, but this argument had no sound basis. The
                                   adoption of the constitutional amendment will effectually settle
                                   that. The friends of the bill can not be sincere in this, or they
                                   would not have voted down Mr. Shirley's amendment to
                                   provide only for the payment of the bonds which are a lien upon
                                   the canal. They not only voted that down, but they stifled
                                   debate, and he had a right to charge them with being insincere.
                                   Those who accepted the canal with all its incumbrances, having
                                   done so with a full knowledge of those incumbrances, can have no
                                   recourse against the State. He believed the payment of these
                                   bonds would give them a better claim than they have, for they
                                   could say you have violated your part of the contract as
                                   stipulated in the proviso to the Butler bill, and we can come in
                                   with our original claim. He deprecated the consideration of this
                                   as a party question. It could only be made such by the majority,
                                   and their present course tends to make it so; but he stood the
                                   peer of the gentleman from Marion, and nothing the opposition
                                   could do would throw him from his footing as an independent
                                   representative.
                              Mr. HENDERSON said before the vote was taken he wished to remind
                                   his fellow representatives that they were acting on their own
                                   responsibility, without instructions from their constituents. He
                                   knew of no community or county in the State that wanted to pay
                                   these bonds. Hence, it certainly could not be regarded that a
                                   delay of a few days to examine the question before voting would
                                   be improper. His people certainly did not want to pay these
                                   bonds, at least, and he should therefore vote against it.
                              Mr. CLARK said he would remind the gentlemen that there was at
                                   least one member whose people, if they had not formally
                                   instructed him, had at least indicated their views very clearly.
                                   The subject of the payment of the bonds was discussed during the
                                   canvass, and there was no voice raised against the payment. He
                                   thought that an honest man, who failed in business and took
                                   refuge behind the bankrupt law, if he ever rose to affluence, was
                                   bound to pay his honest debts. It seemed to him that the State of
                                   Indiana was bankrupt in 1847, and if she is able to pay her debts
                                   to-day she is bound to do so. He should, therefore, vote aye.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN said this was perhaps the most important subject that
                                   would come before this Legislature, and he agreed that there
                                   ought to be a full and fair discussion of its merits. He also
                                   agreed that it should not be made a partisan measure. He did not
                                   know what was the feeling of his own county on this question. If
                                   he did he would carry out their wishes, and if he could not do it
                                   conscientionsly he would resign and go home. But as they did not
                                   instruct him, he proposed to follow his own views and opinion on
                                   the subject. He knew that legislation is too often influenced by
                                   lobbyists. Every member on the floor should act for himself. What
                                   do the friends of the bill say it should be passed for? In the
                                   first place it is to prevent the happening of an uncertain
                                   contingency that the State will be in danger of being saddled
                                   with a debt of twenty millions that was canceled by the transfer
                                   of the canal. Another reason is that if you don't do it
                                   the credit of the State will be gone; that we will be
                                   repudiators. If the State would be liable to any such charge he would vote for
                                   the passage of the bill. He would do almost anything to preserve
                                   the glory and credit of the State. Bute he denied it, and called
                                   upon the friends of the measure to snow where the credit of the
                                   State was ever pledged for the payment of these bonds. He defied
                                   the Attorney General or anybody else to tell him where the credit
                                   and faith of the State was now at stake.
                              In 1832 the first act in this State on the subject of internal
                                   improvement, was passed. At that time lobbyists told the people
                                   that these improvements could be made for $200,000. They issued
                                   200 bonds for that purpose. They were put on the market, and
                                   these Wall street sharpers took them. The State charged these
                                   bonds on the Wabash and Erie Canal and its tolls and revenues,
                                   and guaranteed that they would be sufficient for that purpose.
                                   Not one of these 200 bonds was ever surrendered or canceled under
                                   the Butler bill, nor paid by the State. The Supreme Court of the
                                   United States has decided that they are a prior lien on the
                                   canal. All the arguments of the gentlemen apply with equal and
                                   greater force to the 200 bonds issued under the act of 1832.
                              To sustain this position, Mr. Cauthorn read from the decision of
                                   the Supreme Court in the case of Beers against the Trustees of
                                   the canal. He then proceeded to give a history of the legislation
                                   on the subject subsequent to 1832, and the acts done in pursuance
                                   of it. He charged that of the ten millions issued in 1836, the
                                   State lost five millions by the frauds of the agents, who
                                   appropriated them to the payment of their own private debt.
                                   Unfortunately, they were thrown on the market and got into the
                                   hands of innocent purchasers. Thus they remained until 1840, when
                                   the great crash came. Upon their motion in 1846, the compromise
                                   was made. The proposition came from the creditors. They knew if
                                   they could get the canal lands from the State it would be a good
                                   bargain. He argued that by the terms of the legislative contract,
                                   these bonds were all paid and the holders could never set up a
                                   claim against the State for their payment, otherwise than was
                                   provided for by that contract.
                              Mr. KIMBALL said the act of 1847 contained a clause which expressly
                                   declared that the tolls and revenues of the canal, the lands,
                                   etc., were specially pledged for the payment of the debt and the
                                   State bound herself not to permit an appropriation of such tolls
                                   and revenues, etc., for any other purpose. The whole question was
                                   summed up in that very clause. If we stand by and permit the
                                   tolls and revenues of the canal to be sequestrated we do
                                   precisely what we pledged ourselves in that act not to permit to
                                   be done. He held that it was the duty of the State to stand by
                                   her pledged faith. If the law releases a man from an obligation
                                   and he afterwards becomes able to pay it and refuses to pay his
                                   debts he is a dishonorable man. Shall the State of Indiana be
                                   less careful of her honor than a private individual? By the
                                   arrangement that was made, which was at the instance of the
                                   creditors, when a man voluntarily surrendered his bonds he took
                                   one half in cash and a lien on the canal for the other half. When
                                   these men refused to surrender, they refused to eome under the
                                   contract and could not be bound by it, and he stood ready to cast
                                   his vote for the bill to sustain the honor of the State. The
                                   question had been submitted to the people. Everywhere he spoke
                                   during the canvass he mentioned it, and proclaimed to the world
                                   and the people of Indiana, that he, as a member of his party was
                                   in favor of voting for the payment of that claim. He stood
                                   to-day, not as a partisan, but as a citizen to discharge his
                                   duty.
                              Mr. BRETT failed, upon an investigation to see how a refusal to pay
                                   the bonds named in this bill, could in anywise subject the State
                                   to the resumption of the part of the State debt for which the
                                   canal was taken by the creditors of the State under the acts of
                                   1846-7, commonly called the Butler bills. It is said that the
                                   bonds named in this bill are a prior lien upon the canal.
                                   Governor Baker said, in one of his messages, that they were only
                                   a lien upon that portion of said canal south of the Tippecanoe
                                   River; but grant that the lien is upon the whole of the Wabash
                                   and Erie Canal, and that the canal should be sold for the payment
                                   of the bonds, I still insist that the State would incur no
                                   liability to the present holders of the canal. Section eight of
                                   the act of 1846, commonly called the "Butler
                                   bill," provides that the canal shall be taken,
                                   "subject to all existing rights and equities against the
                                   State on account of the State, or any part thereof, or
                                   liabilities of the State," growing out of, or in
                                   relation thereto; and the same to be held by said trustees in
                                   trust and security, for the uses and purposes
                                   following," etc. From the above extract it is evident
                                   that the Legislature intended to transfer the canal, subject to
                                   all liens and demands whatever; and the stockholders so
                                   understood the contract, as evidenced by the fact that bonds 69
                                   and 70, held by Joseph D. Beers, and 53 and 54, held by Israel
                                   Cohen, have been redeemed by
                                   Charles Butler, the trustee on the part of the stockholders, at
                                   his office in the city of New York. The total amount of principal
                                   and interest paid on said bonds being $14,450 22, as shown in a
                                   communication of a recent date, from Thomas Dowling, Esq., one of
                                   the canal trustees, to His Excellency, Governor Baker. I have
                                   also been told that one of the trustees gave as a reason for not
                                   redeeming the remaining unsurrendered bonds that the trust was
                                   unable to do so for want of money. On page 44 of the journal of
                                   the last House of Representatives of this State, I find in the
                                   message of the Governor of the State therein recorded this
                                   extract from an opinion of the Supreme Court, to-wit:
                                   "The holders of the latter bonds believed that with the
                                   $200,000 lien prior to theirs they would improve their condition
                                   by taking the State for one-half the debt and the canal stock
                                   certificates for the other." It must be evident from
                                   this extract that the Supreme Court construed the law to the
                                   effect that the canal was taken by the stockholder subject to all
                                   prior liens upon it. Considering the facts, it seems clear to my
                                   mind that the State can not in any event be compelled to resume
                                   the debt that was adjusted and settled when the present holders
                                   of the canal stock took possession of the canal under the act of
                                   1846 and 1847.
                              Mr. BRANHAM said, when the compromise was made it was the opinion
                                   of the House as well as the agent of the bondholders, that the
                                   property was not only amply sufficient to pay the bonds
                                   surrendered, but to take up all the liens on the canal. That was
                                   the basis upon which they all acted. Unfortunately for them and
                                   for the State it proved a failure. There is no man in the House
                                   now who believes that the canal is good for the debt, and the
                                   only thing left is the guaranty of the State. These men took the
                                   canal in payment for their debt and made a new contract, and if
                                   we allow this prior lien to come and sweep away the canal from
                                   under them, it sets the contract aside, and the State becomes
                                   liable for the original debt. He called on the members to come up
                                   like honest men and pay the obligations of the State. Gentlemen
                                   say the question was not before the people. He took the ground
                                   openly before the people that we must pay these 191 bonds in
                                   order to secure parties contracting and prevent the
                                   State's liability to pay the original canal debt. And he
                                   told the people if they did not want the bonds paid not to vote
                                   for me, and came here with a majority o over 400. He therefore
                                   considered himself instructed to vote for this bill.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY. Gentlemen say in effect: If I take property and sell
                                   it with knowledge of the legal insolvency by reason of the prior
                                   lien, then I am liable. But if I sell with no knowledge in
                                   respect to to the lien, I am not liable. Whenever a man so
                                   purchases property, (whether a firm or otherwise) he is subject
                                   to the lien.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. Whilst the purchaser of the property has no lien, the
                                   man that has the prior lien takes it.
                              Mr. WYNN now demanded the previous question, and there being a
                                   second by a majorty of the House, the main question was ordered,
                                   viz: Shall the bill pass? The yeas and nays being ordered and
                                   taken thereon resulted--yeas, 55; nays 41, as follows:

                              So the bill was passed the House of Representatives.

                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The SPEAKER resumed the chair at two o'clock p. m., and
                                   took up the order of the call for
                         
                         
                              REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                              Mr. WALKER, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                   returned Mr. Jones' bill [H. R. 184] to create the
                                   Thirty-second Judicial Circuit, recommending its indefinite
                                   postponement.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              Mr. FURNAS, from the Committee on Agriculture,
                                   returned Mr. Hatch's bill [H. R. 191] to protect stone
                                   and timber from unlawful removal with an amendment striking out
                                   $500, and the remainder of the section, and inserting
                                   "not less than $25 nor more than $300," and
                                   adding "imprisonment in the county jail from ten to
                                   sixty days."
                              The amendment was adopted, and the bill ordered to the
                                   engrossment.
                              
                              Mr. BILLINGSLEY returned Mr. Butts' bill [H. R. 195] to
                                   amend section seven of the supervisors' act,
                                   recommending its indefinite postponement, (for the reason that
                                   the title does not correspond with the matter of the bill,) and
                                   reporting a substitute, viz: A bill [H. R. 225] to amend section
                                   two of the act to provide for the protection of wild game,
                                   approved March 7, 1867, and to provide for the protection of
                                   certain birds and their eggs.
                              The report was concurred in and the substitute was advanced to the
                                   second reading.
                              Mr. MELLETT, from the Committee on Education,
                                   returned Mr. Lenfesty's bill [H. R. 130] to render
                                   uniform the rate of interest (8 per cent.) on the Common School
                                   Fund of the State, recommending its passage.
                              It was ordered to the engrossmemt.
                              Mr. WOODARD, from the Committee on Fees and
                                        Salaries, returned Mr. Riggs' bill [H. R
                                   113] to amend section two of the act to amend sections four and
                                   seven of the act to provide for the election of Attorney General,
                                   etc , approved June 13, 1861, recommending its passage. (It
                                   proposes to raise the salary of that officer to $3,000.)
                              It was ordered to the engrossment.
                              Mr. COLE returned Mr. Wilson, of Ripley's bill [H. R. 25]
                                   defining the salary of the Governor, Judges of the Supreme,
                                   Circuit and Common Pleas Courts, and District Attorneys, and to
                                   repeal section twenty-four of the act of 1865, to sell certain
                                   real estate and provide a residence for the Governor,
                                   recommending its indefinite postponement.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, moved to recommit the bill with
                                   instructions, but before it was reduced to writing, on motion of
                                   Mr. GIVAN, the matter was laid on the table.
                         
                         
                              REPEAL OF THE CORPORATION DRAINAGE ACTS.
                              Mr. BRANHAM called for the special order and it was taken up, viz:
                                   Mr. Butterworth's bill [H. R. 3] to repeal the
                                   corporation drainage act of 1869, and the supplemental act of
                                   1871.
                              Mr. BUTTERWORTH, having introduced this bill and before given his
                                   views of it on the floor, he would not now say more than to
                                   represent the desirableness of this repeal in the northwestern
                                   part of the State, and invoke the House to sweep it from the
                                   statute book.
                              The SPEAKER (Mr. Offutt in the chair) directed the Clerk to read
                                   the bill and it was accordingly read the third time.
                              Mr. HATCH was earnestly in favor of the passage of this bill, and
                                   hoped no specious considerations would prevent this swindle from
                                   being wiped out. This Kankakee company had assessed a large
                                   amount of lands to nearly their full value, which threatened to
                                   drive out the owners, but they were subject to the difficulty of
                                   selling land subject to such an encumbrance. His people, who have
                                   felt its practical workings, unite in pronouncing this law most
                                   oppressive and unjust, and ask for the passage of this bill to
                                   repeal it as an act of simple justice.
                              Mr. HELLER also spoke against the bill, and submitted a statement
                                   in figures, showing that the Kankakee company have assessed
                                   nearly five millions of taxes on 600,000 acres of land--$8 an
                                   acre, and more than their value; that they propose to make their
                                   ditch some four miles north of the Kankakee stream, taxing the
                                   lands on the south that do not require their drainage, and
                                   concluding that they might with equal justice extend their
                                   assessments to Indianapolis. He also showed from the act their
                                   extravagant powers, denouncing it as a disgrace to the statutes,
                                   and calling upon gentlemen not specially interested to come up to
                                   the help of Representatives from the northern counties, and stamp
                                   this swindle into its native mire. We will break the back of this
                                   monster, and let it sink into the swamps of the Kankakee.
                              Mr. JOHNSON having been entrusted by the Judiciary
                                        Committee with the investigation of this matter,
                                   and complimented by Representatives interested with an invitation
                                   to make the argument delivered an elaborate speech on the whole
                                   premises. He said:
                              Mr. Speaker : The pending bill proposes to repeal the act of May
                                   22, 1869, and the act supplemental thereto, approved February
                                   23d, 1871.
                              The act of 1869 authorizes the formation of companies for the
                                   purpose of "draining, reclaiming, and protecting lands
                                   which are wet, or liable to be overflowed."
                              A company organized under this act can not consist of less than
                                   three members, all of whom must be owners of lands to be affected
                                   by the proposed work.
                              The process of forming the company is simple in the extreme.
                              Three or more persons owning lands of the character indicated, come
                                   together and sign articles of association, specifying the name
                                   and purposes of the company, and file the articles thus signed
                                   for record in the offices of the Recorders of "each of
                                   the several counties in which any part of the work shall be
                                   situated, and from the date
                                   of filing the same for record in either of such counties, such
                                   companies shall be a body corporate with all the powers incident
                                   to such bodies." When the corporation is thus formed
                                   "it shall have power," in the language of the
                                   statute "to straighten, widen, deepen and make new
                                   channels for the whole, or any part, of any river or
                                   water-course, and to construct any dykes, drains, levees and
                                   breakwaters, and to do everything which they shall deem proper to
                                   accomplish the purposes for which the company shall have been
                                   organized."
                              In order to raise money for the prosecution of the proposed work,
                                   the company may apply to the Circuit or Common Pleas Court of any
                                   county in which any part of the work shall be situate, or to a
                                   Judge in vacation, and it is made the duty of the Court, or
                                   Judge, upon such application, to appoint three appraisers. These
                                   appraisers "examine all lands, the intrinsic or market
                                   value of which may be by them supposed to be liable to be
                                   affected by the construction of the proposed work."
                              The land, for the purposes of the appraisement, is listed in forty
                                   acre tracts. No estimate is made of the value of the lands
                                   themselves.
                              They estimate:
                              1st. The injuries which the land will sustain.
                              2d. The benefits which the lands will derive from the proposed
                                   work.
                              These estimates are made in schedules, signed and sworn to by the
                                   appraisers. The schedules are filed in the offices of the
                                   recorders of the several counties, and, from the time of filing,
                                   become liens upon the lands assessed for the amount of benefits,
                                   less the amount of injuries.
                              These liens are, to all intents and purposes, involuntary mortgages
                                   upon the lands, and section eleven of the act of 1869 provides
                                   that they may be enforced by foreclosure the same as mortgages.
                                   There is no requirement that these corporators shall be occupants
                                   of the land, nor even residents of the State. They may be non
                                   residents. They may be foreigners. There is no provision fixing
                                   the quantity of land which they shall own, either individually or
                                   collectively. They may own but forty acres of land each, or but
                                   forty acres, or more or less, all together. The powers accorded
                                   them by this statute are unlimited in their extent, and monstrous
                                   in their character.
                              A few unprincipled speculators, residing perhaps in a distant
                                   State, happening to own a small tract of wet lands, or lands
                                   liable to be overflowed--lands which may be worth five dollars
                                   per acre, or which may be almost worthless, may, under the
                                   provisions of this law, take possession of the whole of a
                                   valuable water coursemay absolutely control the great domain
                                   through which it passes, and may prostrate the interests of half
                                   a million of the people, and so long as the law remains no power
                                   can check them. Their power is bounded only by their own
                                   recklessness or avarice.
                              Under this statute two or more companies may organize for the
                                   purpose of draining the same region of country, or of
                                   straightening, widening or deepening the same watercourse.
                              In point of fact the Kankakee Valley Draining Company and the
                                   Newton County Draining Company, have both actually organized, for
                                   the purpose of performing exactly the same work, upon the same
                                   river, and the same lands, and taxing, within the limits of
                                   Newton county, the same people, and I believe the Supreme Court
                                   have held both organizations valid. And in the conflict and
                                   confusion of rights which must follow the people are to suffer,
                                   and nobody but a lot of dishonest adventurers are to be
                                   benefitted.
                         
                         
                              ELECTION OF DIRECTORS.
                              Section 2 of the act directs that the members of the company
                                   "shall elect from their number not less than three nor
                                   more than seven directors, of the time and place of which
                                   election the members shall notified by notices signed by three
                                   members and posted in three public places near the work, five
                                   days before the election."
                              After the first election the company must hold annual elections, as
                                   provided for in section 4, "at such times and places as
                                   the company shall appoint, for the election of directors, of
                                   which twenty days' notice shall be given by one
                                   week's publication in one newspaper of general
                                   circulation in each county, in which any part of the work shall
                                   be situate; and if there is no such paper, then by posting notice
                                   in three public places near the work."
                              Now these requirements for notice to be given of elections amount
                                   to just nothing at all. Notices of the first election must be
                                   posted five days near the work. The Kankakee Valley Draining
                                   Company propose to straighten the channel of the Kankakee river.
                                   Dense jungles and dismal swamps extend from the banks of the
                                   river a distance of from three to ten miles in either direction.
                                   If they could hire one of the wild Indians still lingering in
                                   that region to work his way through the swamps among the poison
                                   vines, and the snakes, to
                                   the bank of the river, and pin up the notices on three saplings
                                   five days before the election, this would be good notice under
                                   section 2, and if the feat were performed twenty days before the
                                   election it would be good notice under section 4. Mark, the
                                   notices are not to be posted in each county where the work lies,
                                   but if posted in one county, it is good notice to all persons in
                                   all the counties. The Kankakee river runs the length of eight
                                   counties, so that if the notices are posted in the swamps at the
                                   western State line, they are as good against the people of St.
                                   Joseph county a hundred miles distant on the headwaters of the
                                   river, as they are against those of the proximate or intermediate
                                   counties.
                              No proof of the posting or publication of the notice is reqired.
                                   Nobody is required to make an affidavit of it, and no public
                                   officer is required to supervise it, or take proofs. So it is a
                                   mere matter of discretion with the company whether they will give
                                   notice at all or not.
                              These acts do not require these elections to be held in any of the
                                   counties where the work is situate; nor even in the State. They
                                   may be held in Chicago, or New York, or New Orleans, or anywhere
                                   else, where it will be most certain that the resident land owners
                                   will never find them,and never be able to attend them. I am
                                   informed that the elections of the Kankakee Valley Draining
                                   Company have all actually been held out of the State. Just where
                                   is unknown, owing to the inability of the people to penetrate the
                                   swamps, in order to find the notices.
                              Again, these acts do not provide, as they should, that a majority,
                                   nor any other proportionate number, of members should be present
                                   at the elections. Nor do they provide that one-half, nor any
                                   other proportionate quantity of the land owned by members of the
                                   Company, much less the land to be affected by the work, shall be
                                   represented at the elections.
                              Neither are votes counted as they should be, according to the
                                   quantity or value of the interest of the members. The vote of a
                                   member owning one acre of land weighs as heavily as that of one
                                   owning a thousand acres.
                              See the unjust workings of this law. We will suppose the members of
                                   the Kankakee Valley Draining Company to own, collectively, one
                                   hundred thousand acres of land, of which we will suppose the
                                   three, or seven, enterprising directors to own but one hundred
                                   and fifty acres. We will suppose the Directors to live in
                                   Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as I believe some of them actually do.
                                   They call an election to take place in the private office of one
                                   of their own number. Of course it is out of the question to
                                   expect the humble land owners of the Kankakee Valley to attend
                                   this election. These three or seven sharpers, being probably the
                                   smallest land owners in the Company, gravely elect themselves
                                   Directors, and thus take and keep control of the entire interest
                                   of the honest men who are so deeply interested in the work. Add
                                   to this the further fact that the great body of the land owners
                                   who are to be so deeply affected by the work of the Company, are
                                   not members of the organization at all, and you have a
                                   combination of fraud and despotism which is startling to
                                   contemplate.
                              But let me examine a little further the mode of levying assessments
                                   upon the lands.
                         
                         
                              APPRAISERS.
                              The company may apply to the Court, or Judge, who most,
                                   "immediately upon such application, appoint three
                                   disinterested appraisers." Now, these appraisers are to
                                   assess the lands of a great number of persons; and are to be the
                                   sole judges of the amounts of the levies. In short, the people
                                   are absolutely at their mercy; and yet no notice whatever is to
                                   be given of the time and place, when and where the appointments
                                   are to be made, or applied for. When property is to be sold on
                                   execution, the law provides that the owner must be notified, and
                                   may choose one of the two men who are to appraise it. Not so
                                   here. The owner not only has no voice in selecting the men who
                                   are to appraise and assess his lands, but he must not even know
                                   when or where, or by whom the selectirn is to be made. The
                                   corporation who levies and collects, and uses the assessments has
                                   the whole matter in its own control.
                              But what are to be the necessary qualifications of these
                                   appraisers? Their duties are certainly important--their power for
                                   evil, should they be corrupt or ignorant, is certainly
                                   enormous.
                              Property levied upon by attachment must be appraised by the
                                   Sheriff, "with the assistance of a disinterested and
                                   credible householder of the county."
                              Property levied upon by execution must be appraised by
                                   "two disinterested householders of the neighborhood
                                   where the levy is made, one to be chosen by each of the
                                   parties." Why are not the same safeguards erected here,
                                   where the interests involved are almost incalculably greater than
                                   in the cases which I have mentioned?
                              
                              This law requires simply that the appraisers shall be
                                   "disinterested." The very thought of their
                                   being disinterested is annihilated instantly by the fact that
                                   they are to be employed and paid by the company for whose benefit
                                   the appraisements are to be made. They are not required to be
                                   credible citizens, nor householders, nor freeholders, nor
                                   residents of the county, nor even of the State. They have not the
                                   first single qualification of upright and impartial appraisers.
                                   They may be non residents of the State; they may be honest men,
                                   but totally ignorant of the lands they are to assess; they may be
                                   seedy vagabonds and professional dead beats, and, if I am not
                                   very seriously misinformed, this is the actual character of men
                                   who have appraised most of the lands in the Kankakee Valley.
                              These appraisers are not appointed in each county. Being appointed
                                   in one county, where part of the work lies, they make the
                                   appraisements in all the counties into which it extends. This is
                                   certainly wrong; for if the appraiser should be even an excellent
                                   judge of lands and values in the county where he resides, he
                                   might be no judge at all of different lands in a different and
                                   distant county.
                              Section nine requires that "Notice of the time and place
                                   when and where the appraisers will begin the examination of
                                   lands, and the assessments of benefits and injuries
                                   thereto" shall be given. No form of notice is
                                   prescribed, and no particular mode of publishing it is pointed
                                   out. The statute simply says: "It shall be
                                        sufficient it published three successive weeks in a
                                   newspaper in the county where the land is situate." It
                                   is at the option of the company to publish it in a newspaper or
                                   post it in the swamps.
                              The same section provides that "proof of the publication
                                   may be made by the affidavit of the editor of the newspaper, or
                                   of the secretary of the company." But this amounts to
                                   nothing, because there is no requirement that the proof is to be
                                   filed with, or made to any public officer. Nobody supervises or
                                   inspects it, and the company may give notice or not, just as they
                                   please, and nobody can object.
                         
                         
                              THE ASSESSMENT.
                              It would have been expected that so important a matter as making
                                   these assessments would have been guarded and controled by strict
                                   and clear regulations. But it is not so. The language of the
                                   statute is that "such appraisers shall examine all
                                   lands," etc.
                              Must this examination be by an actual view of the lands, or may it
                                   be an inspection of records and maps representing the lands?
                              The friends of this law, and the companies organized under it,
                                   contend that this provision does not contemplate an actual view
                                   of the lands, because, owing to the very nature of the lands
                                   themselves, being marshy swamps, it would be next to impossible
                                   to traverse them, or, in most cases, even to get in sight of
                                   them. Whatever may be the true construction of this statute, it
                                   is sufficient for my purpose to make the point that it is
                                   uncertain, when it ought to be clear, and that, being uncertain,
                                   it may be abused.
                              And indeed, it has been most shamefully abused. I
                                   am assured by a number of reliable gentlemen from the Kankakee
                                   valley counties that the appraisers of the Kankakee Valley
                                   Draining Company did not even pretend to make an actual view of
                                   the lands by them appraised. The whole work of the appraisements
                                   and assessments was done in an obscure room in one of the remote
                                   country towns, near the mouth of the river. Maps and copies of
                                   records served to represent the lands, and to assist the
                                   appraisers in guessing the assessments up to a figure
                                   sufficiently high to satisfy the company who paid them for their
                                   work. This is a grave charge, but I have still further proof of
                                   it. About a year ago General Geo. W. Cass, of Pittsburgh, Penn.,
                                   the treasurer of the Kankakee Valley Draining Company, made a
                                   speech in the rooms of the Board of Trade at Indianapolis. The
                                   speech, after being carefully revised by him, was printed in the
                                   Indiapolis Journal. I hold a copy of it in my
                                   hand, and read from it the following words:
                              "Still another reason for delay has been the work of
                                   assessment. It is no small matter to assess so large a body of
                                   land. Notwithstanding the assertion that the assessment was made
                                   in an office, without an inspection of the property, it has taken
                                   nearly a year to do the work."
                              Here was a fair opportunity to have denied the charge if it had
                                   been false. He not only does not deny it, but in a carefully
                                   prepared and published speech impliedly admits its truth.
                              But let me call attention to the unlimited and dangerous discretion
                                   allowed these appraisers. The language of the statute (section
                                   six) is that they shall assess "all lands, the intrinsic
                                   or market value of which may be by them supposed to be liable to
                                   be affected by the proposed work." The Kankakee Valley
                                   Company propose to straighten the whole channel of a river. To
                                   what distance from the river
                                   on either side may the assessments be pushed? Shall they be
                                   levied upon a strip of country three miles wide, or five miles
                                   wide, or twenty miles wide? The appraisers are the sole judges.
                                   What lands are to be assessed? Wet lands only, or dry lands also?
                                   "All lands the intrinsic or market value of which may be
                                   supposed by them (the appraisers) to be affected by the proposed
                                   work." The appraisers are the absolute judges.
                              What shall be the basis of the estimates? Shall each tract or each
                                   acre be assessed according to its value? This is the rule of
                                   taxation by the State government and the county and municipal
                                   organizations; but not so in this case. The appraisers may levy
                                   the assessment according to their own whims "without
                                   regard to the value of the lands or the costs of the proposed
                                   work." (Sec. 6.)
                              The value of the lands may be only three dollars per acre, and
                                   these appraisers may levy upon it a tax of ten dollars an acre.
                                   The cost of the work may be one hundred thousand dollars, but
                                   these appraisers may levy assessments to the amount of one
                                   million, or five million dollars. In short, their discretion is
                                   unrestrained, and their power unlimited. This is indeed, an
                                   alarming picture, but it is still short of the truth as I will
                                   show by actual facts.
                         
                         
                              RE-ASSESSMENTS.
                              But after the exercise of this fearful power will the corporation
                                   then be satisfied?
                              Section 6 provides further "that as often as it shall be
                                   desired by the company to make a reassessment of any tract or
                                   tracts of land for any purpose, said appraisers shall, upon
                                   request of the company, make such reassessments and so, from time
                                   to time, when, and as often as they shall be requested, and shall
                                   make and return full schedules of the same; and such schedules
                                   shall be filed for record, shall constitute liens, shall be
                                   collected, and shall in all respects be governed by the same
                                   rules and have the same force and effect as the original
                                   assessments above provided for."
                              The appraisers themselves without character or qualifications!
                                   Their power unlimited as to the lands which they shall assess, or
                                   the amount of their levies! And a soulless corporation with
                                   unrestrained power to repeat the assessments at their discretion
                                   and upon any pretext to suit their own purposes!
                              These details are so loose and reckless as to make it impossible to
                                   justify them and disgraceful to defend them. But if this is true
                                   of the provisions which I have been discussing, what will be said
                                   of section 15? It is as follows:
                              "No informality, irregularity or omission which shall have
                                   occurred, or which may occur in the organization or proceeding of
                                   any company, or in the appointment or proceedings of any of their
                                   officers, agents, or the appraisers, shall affect the rights and
                                   privileges of such company, or invalidate the assessments of the
                                   appraisers, nor any sale of land which may be made under any
                                   foreclosure of any lien for the aesessments
                                   thereon."
                              The effect of this is simply that the rules prescribed by law for
                                   the proceedings of the company may be followed by the company or
                                   not, just as they like. Whatever they may have done or may do, is
                                   here legalized, however unjust or oppressive. No defect in the
                                   organization of the company, no violation of private right or
                                   public justice, no omission or neglect of prescribed duty can
                                   possibly be imagined which is not cured by this section.
                         
                         
                              POWER TO ISSUE BONDS.
                              As we have seen the schedules of assessments, when filed in the
                                   offices of the Recorders, become liens upon the lands, in the
                                   nature of mortgages, and the company may enforce them by
                                   foreclosure.
                              Section 13 provides that the company may borrow money by issuing
                                   and selling their bonds. In order to secure the payment of these
                                   bonds and the interest on them at maturity, section 13 further
                                   provides that the company may mortgage or pledge the assessments
                                   to the bondholders, or, at their option, to Trustees,for the
                                   benefit of the bondholders. These bonds are invested with every
                                   attribute of negotiability, and indeed are protected in the hands
                                   of innocent holders with a care far more sacred than is extended
                                   to any instrument known to the law merchant. The last clause of
                                   section 12 provides:
                              "And after any such bond shall have been negotiated, no
                                   action or proceeding shall be instituted, nor any defense to any
                                   action interposed by the company, or any other person or persons,
                                   the object and tendency of wl ich shall be to impair the
                                   validity'or security, or to depress the value of such
                                   bonds, any provision of the law to the contrary
                                   notwithstanding."
                              Now, a note or bill of exchange, negotiable by the law merchant,
                                   passes into the hands of innocent third parties, free from all
                                   defenses which the maker may have had against the original
                                   holder. But if a mortgage is given by the maker to secure payment
                                   of the note, he may defend against the mortgage, in the hands of
                                   any holder, however remote.
                                   The note can not impart the quality of negotiability to the
                                   mortgage, nor to any other instrument given to secure it.--14th
                                   Ohio State R. 423.
                              But this statute first invests the bonds of the company with the
                                   strict and exceptional attribute of negotiability, and, still
                                   further, extends the same quality to the mortgages given to
                                   secure them, and, still fnrther, to the assessments upon which
                                   the mortgages are given. It was justly thought when commercial
                                   paper was clothed with the quality of negotiability that it was a
                                   hardship, which nothing but the necessities of commercial
                                   business could justify; and courts and legislatures have steadily
                                   and properly refused to enlarge this class of instruments. Here
                                   then is a most startling and dangerous anomaly. First, the bonds
                                   made are sacred, and through them all remedies denied the people
                                   against both the mortgages and assessments upon their lands, no
                                   difference how unjust or fraudulent they may be.
                         
                         
                              RIGHT OF APPEAL.
                              But in this provision there is a covert fraud which renders the
                                   danger to the people more appalling still. Let us see:
                              The latter clause of section six provides that "Any person
                                   aggrieved by the assessments may at any time within thirty days
                                   thereafter appeal therefrom to the Circuit or Common Pleas Court
                                   of said county."
                              Now, here is a right of appeal which looks fair enough on its face,
                                   but it is completely destroyed by section thirteen, which we have
                                   just been considering.
                              To illustrate: We will suppose the assessments levied and the
                                   schedules filed in the Recorder's office on the first
                                   day of the month. On the same day, or the next day, the Company
                                   may issue and negotiate one or more bonds arid mortgage the
                                   assessments to secure them. The thirty days allowed for an appeal
                                   have not expired yet, nor even two days of the thirty; but
                                   section thirteen says, "after any such bonds shall have
                                   been negotiated, no action or proceeding shall be instituted, nor
                                   any defense to any action interposed, by the Company or any other
                                   person, the object or tendency of which shall be to impair the
                                   vitality or the security, or to depress the value of such
                                   bonds--any provision of the law to the contrary
                                   notwithstanding."
                              Now the institution of an appeal from the assessments mortgaged
                                   would very clearly be "the institution of a
                                   proceeding," and it would with equal clearness have a
                                   very decided "tendency to impair the security, and
                                   depress the value of the bonds."
                              Thus all questions concerning the assessments are put at rest, and
                                   end with the filing of the schedules with the Recorder, and the
                                   sacred right of of appeal, and the still more sacred right of
                                   trial by a jury of the country, are denied the people, at the
                                   will of a tyrannical corporation.
                              It will not relieve this view in the least regard for me to say
                                   that at best I gravely doubt the validity of this section
                                   providing for appeals. It prescribes no mode by which the appeal
                                   shall be taken. It gives barely the naked right of appeal without
                                   providing any manner in which it may be enforced. I seriously
                                   doubt if it is not a nullity.
                              When the bonds of the Company are once issued and sold to innocent
                                   purchasers and the assessments are mortgaged to secure them, but
                                   one thing is left for the land owners to do, and that is to pay
                                   their assessments in full, and they can make no defense whatever
                                   against them.
                              And this they are compelled to do, although not one stroke of work
                                   has ever been or shall ever be done upon the proposed
                                   improvements. Could any people be more completely at the mercy of
                                   despotism?
                         
                         
                              THE CORPORATION REQUIRED TO GIVE BONDS.
                              But I am admonished that the law requires these Companies to enter
                                   into bonds with sufficient sureties for the security of the
                                   people whose interests are thus jeopardized.
                              Mr. Speaker, in every section of this law we find a snare.
                              Section ten of the act of 1869 does provide "that unless
                                   the main line of the company's proposed work shall
                                   exceed twenty miles in length, no part of the assessments shall
                                   be collected by the company until the company shall have given
                                   bond."
                              This provision is only applicable to small companies whose main
                                   line is less than twenty miles long, If the proposed work is over
                                   twenty miles in length no bond is required. This is on the
                                   principle that the greater the risk the smaller shall be the
                                   security. A company collecting two or three thousand dollars
                                   shall give bonds, while a company collecting two or three
                                   millions shall give none. This enactment was clearly for the
                                   purpose of strangling small honest associations in the interest
                                   of mammoth speculations.
                              I know that section two of the supplemental act requires a bond of
                                   the large companies; but such a bond as it is! It has but one condition, and that is,
                                   "for the faithful application of any and all moneys
                                   which shall come into its hands to the legitimate purposes of the
                                   corporation."
                              Now what protection does this afford to the honest land owner who
                                   pays his assessment to the company? Just none at all. The same
                                   section declares that "any person aggrieved may have
                                   his, her or their action on this bond for damages
                                   sustained."
                              But what action can the land owner bring? He has paid his money,
                                   and it is lost. He brings his action to recover it. In order to
                                   recover upon this bond he must show, by a preponderance of the
                                   testimony, that the identical money which he paid has been
                                   misapplied by the company, and he must show just how each and
                                   every dollar has been misapplied, and he can recover no more than
                                   he can thus trace out and locate. It is not enough for him to
                                   show that a large amount of money generally has been misapplied,
                                   but each dollar which he locates he must recognize as the
                                   identical dollar which he paid, or he can not recover it. A
                                   recovery on this bond is thus plainly impossible.
                              There is no condition in this bond binding the company to anything.
                                   There is no condition that they shall prosecute their work
                                   faithfully and without delay. There is no stipulation when they
                                   shall commence it nor when they shall complete it. There is not
                                   even a requirement that they shall ever commence it, or ever
                                   complete it. Here again, as at every point, the whole matter is
                                   in the discretion of the company. But this bond obligates the
                                   company to apply all money coming into their hands to
                                        "the legitimate purposes of the
                                   corporation."
                              What are its "legitimate purposes?" We know what
                                   they ought to be; but can we surmise how the corporation, with
                                   its unbounded powers and its soulless body will interpret
                                   them?
                              Section three of the original act declares that "such
                                   company shall be a body corporate, with full power to buy, receive donations of, and hold, and sell,
                                   and convey any lands benefited, or to be benefited by the
                                   proposed work." And here, Mr. Speaker, is the great
                                   secret underlying the whole of this mighty fabric. When the land
                                   owner sues to recover his money, the company answers that they
                                   have it invested, or possibly have lost it in real estate
                                   speculations, and there is an end of it.
                              The securities required by this act were never intended for the
                                   benefit of the persons who bear the burthens. I hold in my hand a
                                   prospectus issued by the Kankakee Valley Draining Company in
                                   1871, about one year ago. On page ten I find the understanding of
                                   that company upon this subject very clearly expressed in these
                                   words:
                              "Ample bonds and security has been given by the
                                   corporation to the State of Indiana, for the benefit
                                        of the bondholders, as well as all other parties in
                                   interest, that all moneys advanced by the purchasers
                                        of bonds, or paid by land owners upon assessments,
                                   shall go into the security pledged to secure the bonds."
                                   The principal purpose in giving security then, is to make the
                                   company's bonds sell. And here is a clear declaration
                                   that these securities are for the benefit of the bondholders, while the poor land owners are
                                   indefinitely referred to as being "other persons in
                                   interest."
                         
                         
                              MEMBERSHIPS.
                              I know the law permits any person owning lands to be affected by
                                   the proposed work to become a member of the company by signing
                                   the articles of association; and it is urged with an appearance
                                   of fairness that the resident landowners can by this means not
                                   only protect themselves, but have it in their power to take
                                   entire control of any company.
                              In the speech to which I have once referred, Gen. Cass, the
                                   Treasurer of the Kankakee Valley Draining Company, used these
                                   words :
                              "The law provides that every man owning an acre of ground
                                   can become a stockholder, and it is the wish of the company that
                                   they would."
                              I have no doubt General Cass earnestly wished so: for the Articles
                                   of Association of his company stipulate that any landowner may
                                   become a member by signing the Articles and "paying to
                                   the company fifty cents for each acre of land owned by
                                   him." So that the initiation fee to membership in this
                                   company is from $20 to $1,000 more or less owing to the wealth of
                                   the individual. "You pays your money and takes your
                                   choice."
                              There is no pretense that this initiation fee is required either by
                                   the letter or spirit of the law. But it is part of the articles
                                   of association which the applicant must sign in order to become a
                                   member, and when he does sign the articles he is as much bound by
                                   this stipulation as any other part of the contract.
                              Another one of these stipulations is that "if he fails to
                                   pay any due or assessment, he shall have no right to hold any
                                   office or vote at any election of the company." So, at
                                   last, we see it costs dearly indeed to get control of one of
                                   these companies. To the
                                   modest landowner it is simply out of the question.
                         
                         
                              CONSTITUTIONAL VIEW OF THE SUBJECT.
                              So far, Mr. Speaker, I have considered only the inheritant defects
                                   and consequent injustice of these laws. Let us now take a higher
                                   view of them.
                              Upon what constitutional ground can they be justified?
                         
                         
                              THE TAXING POWER.
                              One of the highest attributes of sovereignty is the power of
                                   taxation. The Constitution vests this great and sacred power
                                   solely in the Legislature, with no authority to delegate it to
                                   any other hands, except within certain well defined limits.
                              County organizations and municipal corporations may possess this
                                   great power by delegation from the Legislature, but beyond these
                                   it should not go. Only in cases of clear public convenience and
                                   necessity has the transgression of these limits ever been
                                   countenanced, and then only under the strongest safeguards and
                                   most stringent regulations. If this great power is to be
                                   delegated ad libitum to private corporations what protection are
                                   the people to have in their rights of property? Take, for
                                   instance, the real estate in Indianapolis. It is taxed, first, by
                                   the State; next, by the city; next, by each one of the ten or
                                   twelve railroad corporations; next, by five or six manufacturing
                                   associations; and so on without limit, until it is literally
                                   taxed out of existence.
                              Now, by these acts this great power of taxation, under the guise of
                                   assessments, has been delegated, in its widest and most
                                   unrestricted form to mere private corporations. If it is to be
                                   extended to one class, there can be no justice in withholding it
                                   from others. I tell you, Mr. Speaker, in the enactment of these
                                   laws you have gone beyond the constitutional limit, and I demand,
                                   in the name of the suffering people of Northern Indiana, that
                                   this body instantly take the backward step into the province of
                                   just and legitimate legislation.
                         
                         
                              EMINENT DOMAIN.
                              Another one of the highest attributes of sovereignty is the right
                                   of eminent domain.
                              This is defined to be "the right of the sovereign
                                   government to appropriate and control individual property for the
                                   benefit of the whole State."
                              Before any law can be justified as an exercise of this great
                                   department of legislative power it must clearly appear that the
                                   destruction of individual rights, and the appropriation of
                                   individual property which it contemplates are "for the
                                   benefit of the whole State." If the benefits to arise
                                   from its operation are to be confined to any part of the
                                   community less than the general public, the act can not be
                                   referable to the right of Eminent Domain.
                              The purpose of the acts under discussion is to authorize the
                                   draining and protecting of wet lands. In the very nature of
                                   things their operation and their benefits must be confined to a
                                   few localities, comparatively small both in population and
                                   territory. In what department of legislative power, then, must we
                                   seek for a justification for these laws? Clearly not in Eminent
                                   Domain, because, both in their operation and benefits, they are
                                   local and not general.
                         
                         
                              POLICE POWER.
                              There is a branch of legislative authority known as the Police
                                   Power. It has been justly termed "a power without a
                                   definition." It is not accurately bounded or defined by
                                   any judicial authority, but "embraces among its
                                   prominent objects the preservation of peace and order, of health
                                   and morals, and the regulation of rights and duties of
                                   neighborhood." Cooley's Con. Lim. p. 572, Its
                                   principal maxim is "enjoy your own property so as not to
                                   interfere with the rights of your neighbor." It
                                   contemplates no mammoth combinations, nor general public
                                   enterprises. It subjects the property of the individual to the
                                   rights of his neighborhood, and its distinctive feature is that
                                   it is applicable only to individual intercourse in the smallest
                                   local sense. As contradistinguished from the right of eminent
                                   domain, an able counselor has said that "it subjects the
                                   citizen, in respect of his property, to the rights of his
                                   neighbor, while the eminent domain subjects him in respect to his
                                   property, to the exigencies of the State."
                              Obviously, these drainage acts are not referable to this department
                                   of legislative power, for while their operation may, in a few
                                   exceptional instances be confined to small neighborhoods, they
                                   may be extended to the whole of a great watercourse with all its
                                   adjacent territory, or to a great region of wet lands, with its
                                   thousands of owners.
                              Where, then, I ask again, shall these laws be ranged? To what
                                   department of constitutional legislative power shall they be
                                   referred? As they grant to private corporations an unbounded
                                   power of taxation, they transgress the just limit of legislative
                                   authority.
                              They are too narrow to be referred to the right of Eminent Domain,
                                   and too broad to be referred to the Police Power.
                              
                              They are without legitimate parentage; they are the bastard
                                   offsprings of fraud and arbitrary power.
                         
                         
                              THE LAW A JOB.
                              These laws were enacted, not for public benefit, but at the
                                   instance and by the procuration of the Kankakee Valley Draining
                                   Company, and while the Legislature doubtless acted in good faith,
                                   the Company had no object in view except its own profit. I know I
                                   have made a broad assertion, but I believe I can prove it to be
                                   true.
                              I hold in my hand the record in the case of O'Riley vs.
                                   the Kankakee Valley Draining Company, appealed to the Supreme
                                   Court from the Newton Circuit Court. In the answer of the Company
                                   to the complaint in that case, I find these words:
                                   "Thereupon said Company authorized and directed its
                                   President to apply to the General Assembly of the State for an
                                   amendment of said law, (the law of 1867,) and at his instance and
                                   request, and chiefly by his procuration, in the interests of said
                                   Company, the said act of May 22, 1869, was passed."
                              Again, in the Prospectus issued by the Company, to which I referred
                                   a while ago, on page seven I find these words: "Further
                                   legislation being desired, the Company applied to the Legislature
                                   at its session in January, 1871, for the enactment of a
                                   supplemental law, which was passed by the unanimous vote of the
                                   Senate, and a large majority of the Lower House, and was approved
                                   by the Governor on the 23rd day of February, 1871."
                              Again, in General Cass' speech in Indianapolis, to which I
                                   have before referred, he used these words: "The Company
                                   was represented before the Legislature by its President, and that
                                   body in 1871 passed a supplemental act in many respects superior
                                   to the first one, and which was generally satisfactory to the
                                   Company."
                              My statement was that these laws were enacted in the interest of
                                   the corporation, and I believe I have sufficiently proved it,
                                   although but a small part of the available proof has been
                                   adduced.
                         
                         
                              HOW THE LAW HAS BEEN ABUSED.
                              This corporation was organized, as its Articles of Association
                                   show, for the purpose of straightening the channel of the
                                   Kankakee river and draining the swamp lands lying in the Kankakee
                                   Valley. The river rises in the extreme north part of the State,
                                   in the county of St. Joseph, and flows in a south-westerly
                                   direction through eight counties, crossing the western line of
                                   the State into Illinois, where it turns north-ward and empties
                                   into the Illinois river. Its whole course in Indiana lies through
                                   marshy swamps where much of the rich soil is most of each year
                                   covered with water, and is therefore in its present condition
                                   generally worthless, although a great part of the lands are dry
                                   and very productive.
                              To carry out its purposes, the company has levied assssments upon
                                   all lands bordering upon the river from the State line to the
                                   headwaters of the river, a distance of nearly a hundred miles.
                                   The strip of country assessed varies in width from eight to
                                   twenty miles. By reference to page 7 of its Prospectus I find
                                   this statement: "The surveys have been made, and the
                                   cost of the entire wrork estimated at $1,500,000. Six hundred and
                                   twenty-four thousand eight hundred and seventy-two acres of land
                                   have been assessed as liable to be affected by this work, the
                                   present value of which is appraised at $3,798,321, and the
                                   benefits exceeding injuries bv $4,644,010."
                              Let me recapitulate: It has assessed 624,872 acres of land.
                              
                                   
                                        Amount of assessments above injuries........
                                        $4,644,010
                                   
                                   
                                        Value of the
                                             lands.....................................
                                        3,798,321
                                   
                                   
                                        Excess of assessments above the value of the
                                             land...............
                                        $845,689
                                   
                              
                              I referred some time ago to the fact that the assessments might be
                                   made without regard to the value of the lands, and here is the
                                   sequel. They are actually assessed for nearly a million of
                                   dollars more than they are worth, although a great deal of the
                                   land is dry and under cultivation.
                              But another fact:
                              
                                   
                                        The assessments
                                             are....................................

                                        The estimated cost of the

                              Why have they levied more than three times the amount required to
                                   do the work? And what disposition is to be made of this immense
                                   balance? It must be paid, and there is no provision in the law
                                   that any part of it shall be returned by the Company to the
                                   people. It is simply that much clear profit. "The court
                                   awards it and the law doth give it" It is sheer flat
                                   robbery, and deserves no better name.
                              Of course it is absolutely impossible for the humble farmers of
                                   that region to pay these terrible assessments, for the simple
                                   reason that they have not the money to pay with. The result will
                                   be, of course, that their lands will be sold, and bought in by
                                   the corporation, or by the adventurers who compose it. Scarcely a
                                   single individual will escape. And almost the whole of that wide
                                   valley will pass into the hands of these unprincipled sharpers. And this is exactly what
                                   they foresaw and intended from the beginning. Every single man I
                                   believe who was in the original organization of that Company was
                                   a non-resident capitalist. A few residents afterwards became
                                   members, but have withdrawn from it, and their names are now here
                                   on this petition, together with twelve hundred others, praying
                                   for the repeal of the law. In General Cass' speech in
                                   Indianapolis he used these words: "I have said to land
                                   owners I will take your lands, pay for the drainage, and when
                                   reclaimed sell them and share the profits with you."Here
                                   is the coolest impudence I have ever met with. He extends this
                                   invitation to the poor land owner: "Go away and leave
                                   your homestead; I will take charge of it; I will pay the
                                   assessments on it to myself; that is, I will take the money out
                                   of my right pocket and put it into my left pocket; you will lose
                                   your land; but I will get it for nothing you know, and that will
                                   make it all right." And this is exactly what I charged
                                   his purpose to be.
                              But, Mr. Speaker, the work proposed by this Company will never be
                                   accomplished. I don't believe they ever intended to do
                                   what they pretend. They were first organized under the old law of
                                   1868. They have now been a corporate body four years, and not one
                                   stroke of work has yet been done; not a single inch of earth has
                                   yet been turned. They have done nothing except harrass the
                                   people, and hawk their bonds about the streets of eastern cities
                                   for sale. It is uncertain whether any of them have yet been sold
                                   or not. For the sake of the people I hope not. But I warn them
                                   that their days of grace are at an end, and in one hour from this
                                   moment this disgraceful law will be a thing of the past.
                         
                         
                              THE PROPOSED WORK IMPRACTICABLE.
                              But, Mr. Speaker, the work which they propose is impracticable. It
                                   is their purpose, as shown in their surveys, to straighten the
                                   Kankakee river by running an immense ditch its whole length
                                   within this State. About midway in its course through the State
                                   the river bends to the south, and then back again to the north,
                                   making a grand curve some twenty miles in length. This curve it
                                   is proposed to straighten by running a ditch directly from one of
                                   its points to another. The ditch will be about an average of four
                                   miles north of the present bed of the river, in the curve, and
                                   will occupy, to the river, exactly the same position that the
                                   string occupies to a tightly strung bow. Now, water will
                                   naturally seek the lowest level. So, as might have been expected,
                                   tbe ground where the ditch will run at this point is about eight
                                   feet higher than at the river. If they should dig their ditch
                                   eight feet deep the bottom of it would be precisely on a level
                                   with the surface of the river. To add to this folly, they propose
                                   to cnt a lateral ditch for the purpose of draining off the water
                                   which now lies south of the river. This lateral ditch is to cross
                                   the present channel of the river, in the curve, and carry the
                                   water up-hill to the main ditch.
                         
                         
                              QUICKSAND.
                              But such ditches as they propose can not be dug along the course of
                                   that river. A few feet from the surface, I am told, they will
                                   strike quicksand, and there they must stop.
                         
                         
                              THE DAM AT MOMENCE.
                              But the Kankakee Valley can never be drained by any scheme of this
                                   kind. At the town of Momence, in Illinois, nine miles from the
                                   Indiana line, the river falls, and beyond this point its course
                                   is between sufficient banks and through a fine country.
                              At Momence there is an immense natural dam of stone, and over this
                                   the river rushes in foaming rapids for some ten or fifteen miles.
                                   The valley ahove the Indiana line is a low basin, and the river
                                   moves through it with slow and sluggish current. The river may in
                                   course of time cut a deep channel through this stone dam, and
                                   when it does the lands on itsupper waters will drain themselves.
                                   No company can get the water out of this basin by cutting
                                   ditches. You might as well try to drain Lake Michigan by cutting
                                   a trench across its basin. The way to drain the valley is to
                                   blast out the stone dam at Momence. This dam being in lllinois,
                                   is beyond the control of a corporation formed in Indiana. It can
                                   only be removed by compact between the two States, or by the
                                   General Government.
                              Mr. Speaker, it is clear that this company is powerless for good,
                                   but it is terribly powerful for evil. Already dismay has seized
                                   the people of that unfortunate valley. I hold in my hand the
                                   printed calendar of the September Term, 1872, of the Porter
                                   Circuit Court. It shows two hundred and fifty-nine lawsuits now
                                   pending in that court against the company. As many more are upon
                                   the docket of the Common Pleas. Four thousand lawsuits are
                                   burthening the courts and distracting the people of the Kankakee
                                   Valley. We can relieve them all in twenty minutes from this
                                   instant, and I solemnly believe the hour of their deliverance is
                                   at hand. Gentlemen say we
                                   can not destroy vested rights by repealing the laws. It is true
                                   that no legislation can destroy vested rights, but the people
                                   say, "Save us for the future, and our courts will
                                   protect us so far as they can in the present."
                              In the language of the gentleman from Wayne, "We will
                                   hreak the back of this monster and let it sink in the swamps of
                                   the Kankakee."
                              When he had concluded the bill was finally passed the House--yeas
                                   89, nays 1, with an amendment to the title, "saving the
                                   operations of those whose works are ten miles in length or
                                   under."
                              Mr. SHIRLEY submitted a resolution (which was adopted) instructing
                                   the Committee on the Judiciary to report to
                                   the House, by bill or otherwise, whether any legislation is
                                   necessary, with regard to redistricting the State for judicial
                                   purposes, so as to equalize the labor of the judges and increase
                                   their salaries.
                              The House then adjourned.

                         INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
                         
                         IN SENATE.
                         
                              WEDNESDAY, December 11,1872.
                         
                         The Senate met at ten o'clock pursuant to adjournment.
                         Prayer was offered by the Rev. Mr. Moran, of the Fourth Presbyterian
                              Church. Among other things for which he thanked God, was "the
                              presence of this body of legislators; the tallest and the heaviest,
                              the handsomest and the wisest, and the purest ever convened in the
                              State."
                         
                              MADISON RAILROAD BILL.
                              Mr. FRANCISCO moved that the regular order of business be dispensed
                                   with that the bill [H. R. 70] might be considered.
                              Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Scott, in consideration of the wishes of the
                                   people in the section more particularly effected by the bill,
                                   hoped the Senate would take it up.
                              Mr. ROSEBRUGH also hoped the motion would be agreed to.
                              It was so ordered.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE entered a motion to reconsider the vote adopting a
                                   resolution allowing stationery and stamps to employes of the
                                   Senate.
                              A motion was made by Mr. SLATER to dispense with the constitutional
                                   restriction, that the bill [H. R. 70] may be advanced to its
                                   final reading.
                              It was agreed to accordingly.
                              The bill [H. R. 70] to enable counties bordering on State lines or
                                   rivers bordering such counties, to aid in building bridges or the
                                   construction of railroads in the counties opposite, passed its
                                   second reading.
                              Mr. FRANCISCO moved to consider the bill as engrossed.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              The bill was accordingly read the third time by sections.
                              Mr. NEFF said he was opposed to the bill. He had now in his
                                   possession a petition signed by over a thousand tax-payers of his
                                   county protesting against the passage of any bill to authorize
                                   taxing the people in aid of railroads. And he himself believed
                                   such taxation was unwise and unjust. Railroad corporations now
                                   govern the whole country. It is impossible to pass any law to
                                   regulate freight and passenger tariffs. Legislation can do
                                   nothing for the people, and the people are complaining
                                   bitterly.
                              Mr. GOODING thought the gentleman should not object. The bill
                                   provides that no taxes shall be levied until two-thirds of the
                                   voters shall have petitioned for it, and he thought they might be
                                   trusted to take care of their own interests. He represented a
                                   county bordering on the Ohio river, and they hoped at no distant
                                   day to subscribe to a railroad running south, which would be of
                                   the highest value to them, and he thought they ought to be
                                   permitted to judge of their own interests; and as the bill
                                   requires the consent of a majority before the aid can be voted,
                                   there can be no danger in passing an act of this character.
                              Mr. ROSEBRUGH believed that inasmuch as this question is to be
                                   decided by a majority of the people of the county, they will be slow to vote such
                                   aid unless very great benefits are to be derived from it. He
                                   would vote for it.
                              Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Scott, stated that this bill may be of very great
                                   benefit to the people not only of Jefferson county, but of the
                                   entire State, and he hoped the Legislature would vote upon this
                                   measure favorably. He said the object of the bill as to connect
                                   the Jeffersonville and Madison road with the road running from
                                   Chattanooga. Tennessee, to Eminence, Kentucky, which would make
                                   the line to Chattanooga 108 miles shorter than by any other
                                   route. This connection would cost but $200,000, and they would
                                   then obtain what Cincinnati would give $10,000,000 to obtain.
                              Mr. SLEETH said he would be glad to vote for the bill, did it not
                                   contain some o the mischievous features of the law of 1869,
                                   especially in providing for the levy of the tax before the
                                   location of the road. Serious injury had resulted from this
                                   provision, and he wanted this bill amended so as to provide that
                                   the road should be located in a satisfactory manner before the
                                   taxes were levied. He would like to see several other conditions
                                   and resolutions in the bill, which he named. He would not make
                                   the levy a lien upon the property until the road be located. The
                                   bill was not read before it was ordered engrossed or he should
                                   have proposed this amendment.
                              Mr. GOODING was sure there were good and sufficient guards thrown
                                   around the bill. He thought the rights of the people were
                                   sufficiently protected by it. Still he was in favor of the
                                   passage of a bill providing that no money should be collected or
                                   paid over until the railroad, or a portion of it was built. But
                                   he hoped this bill, which had passed the House with but one
                                   dissenting voice, would not be killed here.
                              Mr. BROWN defended the bill. He said it gave the subscribers to the
                                   stock of the railroad the right to prescribe themselves the terms
                                   upon which the money shall be paid to the company. It also
                                   provides that the subscriptions shall be due only as the work is
                                   done to the amount of the subscriptions. Surely with these
                                   safeguards the people would be in no danger.
                              Mr. ORR opposed the bill on principle. He was decidedly opposed to
                                   the principle of taxing the people for the purpose of building
                                   railroads and he should have to vote against the bill.
                              Mr. GLESSNER desired but failed to obtain unanimous consent to
                                   offer an amendment that no part of the money shall be collected
                                   or paid until the road be permanently located, nor shall any tax
                                   levied be a lien upon the lands or property until such location
                                   be made.
                              Mr. THOMPSON said that, to accommodate the people in the south part
                                   of the State, he should favor and vote for this bill--ordinarily
                                   he would oppose such a bill as this, but this seemed to be an
                                   extraordinary case. The town of Madison was seeking to open a
                                   connection not only for herself but for the whole interior of the
                                   State with one of the finest thoroughfares in the country. The
                                   advantages to be derived from it were so manifest that he should
                                   vote for the bill.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE demanded the previous question and under its
                                   operation the bill passed by yeas 39, nays 5. Mr. Smith and
                                   Steele explained their vote in the affirmative.
                         
                         
                              A COURT BILL.
                              Mr. MILLER moved to suspend the order of business for the
                                   consideration of the bill [H. R. 69] a bill local in its
                                   character, affecting courts in his district.
                              Mr. BROWN opposed the motion. He said the facts were these: Some
                                   gentlemen ran for office in that Circuit and got beaten, now they
                                   are seeking to create this new Circuit in order that an
                                   appointment might be made. In other words, it was a little job to
                                   get somebody into office. He moved ineffectually to lay the
                                   motion on the table.
                              Mr. GLESSNER announced that Mr. Daugherty, who is sick and confined
                                   to his room to-day, desired that this bill should not be acted
                                   upon in his absence.
                              Mr. DAGGY stated that the bill was o considerable importance to the
                                   locality, and was satisfied it is essentially necessary that they
                                   should have this new Circuit. The business in the courts of these
                                   counties is behind several years, and they need a new
                                   District.
                              Mr. SMITH withdrew his motion out of respect for the sick Senator
                                   (Mr. Daugherty.)
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved to make the bill the special order for to-morrow
                                   at ten o'clock a.m.
                              This motion was agreed to.
                         
                         
                              JUDGES SALARIES.
                              Mr. RHODES, from the Committee on Fees and
                                        Salaries, returned the bill [S. 9] fixing the
                                   salaries of the Judges of the Courts in this State with a
                                   recommendation by the majority that the bill be amended as
                                   indicated in the accompanying report.
                              The bill provides that the salaries shall be as follows:
                              
                              Supreme Court, $5,000; Superior Court, $4,000; Circuit Court,
                                   $3,500; Common Pleas, $2,500; Criminal Court, $3,000.
                              The majority of the committee recommend the salaries shall be as
                                   follows:
                              Supreme Court, $5,000; Superior Court, $3,500; Circuit Court,
                                   $3,500; Common Pleas Court, $3,000; Criminal Court, $2,500.
                              Also an amendment making the salaries of the Superior and Criminal
                                   Judges payable one-third out of county treasuries and remainder
                                   by the State; those of the Common Pleas Judges out of the
                                   treasuries of the counties composing the districts in proportion
                                   to population, and all salaries payable on the first Monday of
                                   January, April, July and October.
                              Mr. NEFF submitted a minority report recommending that the bill be
                                   amended by reducing the sums proposed to be paid the judges of
                                   the Courts as follows:
                              Supreme Court, $4,000; Superior Court, $3,000; Circuit Court,
                                   $2,500; Common Pleas Court, $2,000.
                              Both reports were laid on the table and made the special order for
                                   this afternoon at half past 2 o'clock.
                         
                         
                              RAILROAD TARIFF.
                              The PRESIDENT announced the special order for this hour being the
                                   bill [S. 6] to regulate railroad freight and passenger rates, on
                                   its second reading.
                              The Committee amendment to the first section by appropriately
                                   inserting the words "or other companies or
                                   persons" was agreed to.
                              The amendment striking out the second section was agreed to.
                              The amendment changing the numbering of the sections was agreed
                                   to.
                              The amendment to the fourth section similar to the amendment to the
                                   first section was also agreed to.
                              The amendment adding the fifth section was also agreed to, making
                                   the provisions of the bill apply to all common carriers.
                              Also, the amendment providing that nothing contained in the bill
                                   shall be construed to exempt from the common law and duty
                                   applicable to common carriers, in carrying freight and passengers
                                   for a reasonable compensation.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS moved to amend section 4 by providing that any
                                   officer, agent or employe who shall receive compensation for any
                                   package in violation of the provisions of this act, shall be
                                   deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction may be fined in
                                   any sum not less than $1,000, and be imprisoned for a term not
                                   exceeding twelve months.
                              It was agreed to.
                              Mr. HARNEY moved to insert in section--the words "to and
                                   from each station to any other station on the road."
                              It was agreed to.
                              He also moved to add a section providing that any railroad
                                   violating section 4 of this act shall be liable to action for
                                   damages by any person aggrieved by overcharge: and that the rates
                                   of freight charged between the termini of the road, or between
                                   any two competing points, shall not exceed in amount the rates of
                                   freight from any intermediate point to any other intermediate
                                   point or from any intermediate point to the terminus. This
                                   invidious distinction between points that are not competing and
                                   between competing points, is one of the greatest evils the people
                                   of the State are subjected to at the hands of the railroads.
                              This amendment was also agreed to.
                              Mr. HOUGH moved to amend by striking out the word
                                   "100," in line 68 of section 1, and inserting
                                   in lieu "50;" also "75" in
                                   line 9, and inserting in lieu "40;" also
                                   "50" in line 12, and inserting in lieu
                                   "25;" also the word "3" in
                                   line 3, section 2, and inserting in lieu the word
                                   "2;" and the word "
                                   "3" in line 7, section 4, and inserting in lieu
                                   the word "2," so as to change the rates of
                                   freight carried not more than twenty miles from not more than 100
                                   per cent above the through rates to not more than 50; more than
                                   twenty and not more than fifty miles, from not more than 75 per
                                   cent. to not more than 40; and for a greater distance than fifty
                                   miles from not more than 50 per cent. to not more than 25 per
                                   cent. Also, to limit the rate for passengers to 2 cents per
                                   mile.
                              Mr. HOUGH would not willing do anything that would cripple a
                                   railroad, but while being fair to them, we should be just to
                                   parties who desire to patronize them. The rates now charged are
                                   certainly too high, and the bill does not secure the aims the
                                   author desires.
                              On motion of Mr. DITTEMORE, the amendment was laid on the
                                   table.
                              Mr. ORR moved to amend section 2 by striking out the words
                                   "one half" so that it will read,
                                   "shall not exceed the rate of three cents a
                                   mile."
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. SCOTT moved to add a section repealing all existing laws.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved to amend by excepting from the operation of the
                                   bill all railroad companies whose roads have not been operated
                                   for five years, unless such roads are leased by, consolidated
                                   with or operated by a
                                   company whose road shall have been in operation more than five
                                   years.
                              On motion of Mr. DITTEMORE, the amendment was laid on the
                                   table.
                              On motion of Mr. WILLIAMS the bill was considered engrossed and
                                   read the third time.
                              Mr. SCOTT, who had made several ineffectual efforts to offer an
                                   amendment to the bill, begged permission to say a few words.
                                   Leave was granted, and he said he was decidedly opposed to the
                                   bill, because it would work great harm to his constituents, who
                                   lived at a terminus of a railroad The bill regulated local
                                   freights, but made no provision for determining the rate of
                                   through freights. There was nothing in it to prevent a railroad
                                   from doubling or trebling its through freights. There is scarcely
                                   a road in the State that is paying a dollar on its stock. It is
                                   all they can do to live. Now, if the rates of local freights are
                                   reduced, they must add on at the other end to make up the
                                   deficiency. The result would be that the people of this district
                                   would have to pay two or three or four times the amount for
                                   carrying their freight than they do now. More than that it would
                                   operate as a discrimination against several corporations. The
                                   rich companies would not be sensibly affected by the provisions
                                   of the bill, but the weak corporations which have but little life
                                   in them and are struggling for existence would be blotted out. As
                                   a citizen, living at the terminus of a railroad, he opposed this
                                   bill because his people would have to pay three to six times for
                                   through freight more than they do now, if this bill is passed
                                   into an act; for unless the railroads do increase their charge
                                   for through freights they can not carry local freights and make
                                   enough to pay the interest on their bonded debt or their running
                                   expenses. But two railroads in this State are now paying more
                                   than this. He opposed making his people pay enormous rates of
                                   freight for the benefit of people living along the line of the
                                   road at intermediate stations.
                              At the conclusion of Mr. Scott's remarks, the Senate took
                                   a recess until 2 P. M.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              At 2 o'clock the Senate resumed the consideration of the
                                   order pending.
                              Mr. ROSEBRUGH demanded the previous question.
                              The Senate seconded the demand.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE demanded a call of the Senate, and it being ordered
                                   and taken, discovered forty Senators present.
                              The bill passed the Senate by ayes 37, nays 6, as follows:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             YEAS--Messrs. Armstrong, Beeson,
                                                  Bird, Boone Bowman, Brown, Bunyen, Carnahan, Cave,
                                                  Daggy, Dittemore, Dwiggins, Friedley of Scott,
                                                  Glessner Gooding, Gregg, Hall, Harney, Haworth,
                                                  Hough, Hubbard, Miller, Neff, O'Brien,
                                                  Orr, Rhodes, Ringo, Rosebrugh, Sarnighausen,
                                                  Slater, Smith, Steele, Stroud, Taylor, Thompson,
                                                  Williams, and Mr. President--37.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              NAYS--Messrs. Beardsley, Collett, Howard,
                                   Scott,, Sleeth and Wadge--6.
                              Pending the roll call, Mr. BOONE, in explanation of his vote said,
                                   while he regarded the bill as imperfect they would have to
                                   commence legislation at some point. He was willing to let the
                                   courts point out their mistakes.
                              Mr. COLLETT believing the bill to be improper and unconstitutional
                                   and doing a great injustice to young lines of railroans and
                                   particularly to the North & South railroads, should vote
                                   "no."
                              Mr. DAGGY, when his name was called, declared that he
                                   didn't understand the bill, and voted in the dark and at
                                   random. He had been impressed with the idea that a bill of this
                                   kind could not be made effectual, that it was unconstitutional
                                   and void. Still he felt bound by the known wishes of his
                                   constituents to vote for the bill as expressing the wishes of his
                                   people.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE in explanation of his vote said, while the bill in
                                   its present shape did not meet his entire approbation he was
                                   willing to vote for it and let the responsibility as to its
                                   constitutionality devolve upon another branch of the
                                   government.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS, when his name was called, said the bill was not what
                                   he would have liked. It seemed to him that the freight tariff
                                   should have been fixed in the same way as the passenger tariff,
                                   that is, at so much a mile for a certain distance for a certain
                                   class of freights and so on He also doubted its
                                   constitutionality, but was willing to leave that to the courts.
                                   His opinion was that the benefits of the bill would accrue to the
                                   railroad companies. They have authority under the bill to make
                                   through tariffs just what they choose. The consequence will be
                                   that they will put up their through freights and do a through
                                   business, leaving local business undone. The trouble now is that
                                   men living at local points can not get cars to do the business.
                                   In Northern Indiana to-day there are granaries full of grain, and
                                   have been for the last twelve months. The shippers are willing to
                                   pay the prices demanded, but they can not get the cars. The
                                   companies use all their cars for through business. He thought
                                   this bill would aggravate that trouble. He had some amendments
                                   that he wished to offer, but they were cut off by the motion to
                                        engross. Still he
                                   should vote for the bill, believing that it was a step in the
                                   right direction, though a very bungling one.
                              Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Scott, in explanation of his vote, said he
                                   didn't like the bill, but his people were very clamorous
                                   for some such measure, and he should therefore vote aye.
                              Mr. GOODING, like some others, felt compelled to vote for the bill
                                   under protest. He approved some of its features and disapproved
                                   others. Still it was a step in the right direction, and its
                                   defects might be remedied hereafter.
                              Mr. HARNEY, when his name was called, said the bill had some
                                   objectionable features, and might prove inoperative, but it would
                                   bring the attention of the people and of railroad men to the
                                   subject, and this bill may in time be the means of arriving at
                                   some proper measure. He thought a reduction in tariff would
                                   result in worse accommodations. Still he voted for the bill.
                              Mr. HAWORTH, when his name was called, said he did not understand
                                   the bill in all its features, but being favorable to something of
                                   the kind, and his people desiring it, he voted aye.
                              Mr. HOUGH, in explanation of his vote, said his constituents
                                   demanded that something be done for the reformation of railroad
                                   management, and he was constrained to vote aye, believing,
                                   however, that the bill would prove partly inoperative, but might
                                   be a step in the right direction.
                              Mr. HOWARD, in explanation of his vote, said if this bill met the
                                   demands of its friends it would be the destruction of the only
                                   road in his county, and not being prepared to vote against the
                                   wishes of his people he voted no.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN voted for the bill more as an expression of
                                   popular sentiment than in hope that it would be effective. On
                                   yesterday he said he would be compelled to vote against the bill
                                   in the shape it then was, but he changed his mind because the
                                   bill has been amended since, and because the people demand some
                                   legislation of this kind.
                              Mr. SCOTT would vote against the bill simply because it
                                   discriminated against his people. It must drive through freights
                                   away or increase the rate seriously.
                              Mr. SLATER had no excuses to make in voting for the bill.
                              Mr. SLEETH, said if he was convinced that the passage of the bill
                                   would be nothing more than an expression of the sentiment that
                                   prevails in this country to regulate local freights, he could
                                   consistently and conscientiously vote for it. If he was sure the
                                   Courts would support it or strike it down entirely, he could vote
                                   for it. But what he apprehended was that the Courts might support
                                   the bill in its application to roads organized under the general
                                   railroad law, because we have a right to legislate upon them, and
                                   that they would strike it down and hold it unconstitutional as
                                   applied to railroads that are operated under a special charter
                                   granted under the old constitution. If that should be the case,
                                   then one class of roads would be controlled by the operations of
                                   this bill and another class would not be controlled at all except
                                   by the operations of the common law.
                              He could not risk a vote in favor of the bill for a mere expression
                                   of opinion, with that state of affairs staring him in the face.
                                   Again, there were objections to the bill aside from the
                                   constitutional question. Some amendments that he conceived the
                                   friends of the bill ought to have permitted to be made. For
                                   instance, an amendment should have been adopted providing that
                                   the rates of frieght mentioned in section one should be upon
                                   freights of of the same class going in the same direction. There
                                   are four classes of freight. The rate upon the first class from
                                   New York to Indianapolis is $1 18; the rate upon the fourth class
                                   is only 65 cents. In making this discrimination it ought to be
                                   made to apply to the same class of freights. If not, they may
                                   adopt the highest rate of through freight, and apply it to all
                                   classes. Again, it is questionable what construction might be
                                   placed on the term "through freights." He had
                                   before him the report of the Commissioner of Railroads of Ohio,
                                   and the term "through freight" in that report
                                   always means freight that is loaded on the car and the car run
                                   off on another road to be transported. All there is to do is to
                                   couple it onto a train to carry it over the road and pass it to
                                   another company. But freight that is taken in the parcel at the
                                   depot, and loaded onto the cars, is not through freight. Take
                                   freight from Nashville, for instance. It is brought across the
                                   bridge at Louisville, and the Jeffersonvilie, Madison and
                                   Indianapolis road takes it and brings it to Indianapolis. They
                                   have nothing to do but haul it. That is through freight, and that
                                   class of freight they can afford to haul for a rate at which they
                                   can not afford to haul local freight, which they have to handle
                                   two or three times, nor for an advance of 100 per cent. But he
                                   apprehended that "through freight" as it is
                                   used in this bill, would be construed to be through freight as he
                                   had defined it. He knew that the gentleman who introduced the bill meant
                                   freight carried to the line of the State of Indiana, and no
                                   further. But that is not the idea to be conveyed by the term
                                   through freight. For these reasons, believing that the passage of
                                   the bill would prevent the passage of a better bill at this term,
                                   which he most desired, he felt compelled to vote against the
                                   bill.
                              Mr. THOMPSON, when his name was called, said the universal cry of
                                   the people was that the railroads were imposing on the people
                                   along the lines of the several roads. One great advantage to be
                                   derived frompassing a bill like this, even if it should be
                                   defeated in the House, by the Governor, or by the Supreme Court,
                                   is to let the railroad companies understand that the people look
                                   upon their course as oppressive. This is a mere expression of
                                   that feeling of the people towards the railroads. He believed it
                                   would have a salutary effect upon the railroads themselves; teach
                                   them that they can't have privileges from the State of
                                   Indiana and at the same time disregard the wants of the
                                   community.
                              Mr. WADGE, when his name was called, said he was decidedly and
                                   heartily in favor of any system of legislation which would
                                   protect people against the encroachment of any monopoly, whether
                                   a railroad company, a coal company, a gravel road company, or a
                                   ditching company. But when called upon to vote for a bill he
                                   wanted the privilege of examining that bill and if it did not
                                   meet his views he certainly asked the privilege of giving the
                                   reasons why he dissented. He hailed from a rural district which
                                   he knew was already suffering to some extent from the want of
                                   facilities because of the superior competition or facilities that
                                   are furnished cities for the transportation of their freights,
                                   and he ventured to say that there were but few Senators who did
                                   not know that the inhabitants of local stations between large
                                   cities suffered more or less in consequence of the want of
                                   facilities. He believed this bill was drawn up in this city in
                                   the interest of this city and other cities, and not in the
                                   interest of those that are located on the line of railroads. The
                                   result of the provisions would be to cut off entirely the supply
                                   of railroad facilities to those small cities on the lines, and to
                                   kill very many raods in this State that are struggling for
                                   existence. Take, for instance, the New Albany and Salem Railroad.
                                   The provisions of this bill will virtually kill it if it becomes
                                   law, which he did not believe. The consequent result would be
                                   that the whole section of country between Lafayette and Michigan
                                   City would be almost irrevocably ruined. Farmers would be
                                   deprived of what little facilities they have for the
                                   transportation of freight. He believed the bill would be wholly
                                   impracticable. He presumed that nobody would deny that the charge
                                   ought to be at least $6 for a car for five miles. Now, suppose
                                   the through rate is $3 a car five miles, what would be the charge
                                   from Indianapolis to Michigan City. It would be $96 a car in
                                   order to pay them. Their charge now is $28. In their local
                                   freights, where they have to charge according to the bill 25
                                   cents per hundred for the distance from Indianapolis to Michigan
                                   City, they would be required to extend their through freight rate
                                   to that point to 50 cents, doubling it. A gentleman said some
                                   railroad company charged $66 a car for three hundred miles. If
                                   they put the rate up they would have to charge $180 a car for
                                   that distanceif they put up the rates to such a point as would
                                   make their local rates living.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE, interposing, are you in favor of the passage of any
                                   law to regulate local freights?
                              Mr. WADGE. I will vote for any law that in my judgement will
                                   regulate it, and I am desirous that some bill of that character
                                   should be introduced to restrain railroad companies from
                                   inflicting on the people overcharges. But I believe the present
                                   bill is wholly impracticable.
                              Mr. BROWN'S name being again called he said: "I
                                   havn't got the moral courage to vote against this bill;
                                   the Senate won't let me dodge; therefore I vote
                                   aye."
                              The title was amended at the suggestion of Mr. SCOTT, Mr. BROWN,
                                   and Mr. HOUGH.
                         
                         
                              JUDGES' SALARIES.
                              The President now announced the special order being the majority
                                   and minority reports submitted this forenoon on the bill [S. 9]
                                   to fix the fees and salaries of Judges of courts.
                              Mr. GOODING moved to postpone the consideration of this subject
                                   till Monday next at 2 o'clock.
                              It was agreed to.
                         
                         
                              DRAINAGE OF WET LANDS.
                              Mr. GOODING moved to suspend the regular order and take up the
                                   drainage bill--Mr. Chapman's [S. 88].
                              It was agreed to.
                              The question now being on Mr. Daggy's amendment, to
                                   require the petition for the improvement to be signed by a
                                   majority of the land owners who are liable to assessment
                                   therefor--
                              
                              Mr. DAGGY asked but failed to obtain consent to withdraw his
                                   amendment.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN proposed to amend section nineteen by
                                   providing that no such assessment shall ba a lien on any tract of
                                   land for a greater sum than the expense necessarily incurred in
                                   the construction of the work in proportion to the amount of
                                   benefits.
                              Mr. ROSEBRUGH objected to the withdrawal of the amendment offered
                                   by Mr. Daggy. The great evil of the Kankakee Company was in the
                                   right of a few to impose on the many, and he could not vote for a
                                   bill that did not recognize the rights of a majority to
                                   control.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE moved to lay the amendment (Mr. Daggy's) on
                                   the table, inasmuch as he could not obtain unanimous consent to
                                   withdraw.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              The question recurring on concurring in the report of the Committee
                                   on Corporations--
                              Mr. BOONE moved to amend the report by adding to the 29th section a
                                   proviso that the rights, franchises and powers of incorporated
                                   companies, organized under prior acts, whose main line does not
                                   exceed sixteen miles in length, shall be saved unimpaired.
                              Mr. HUBBARD explained that it was desirable not to leave a single
                                   cloud upon smaller companies, so they may have the benefits of
                                   this bill, and hence the amendments proposed.
                              Mr. BROWN thought it best to strike out of this bill all having
                                   reference to repealing the acts named, and desired nothing left
                                   on the statute book that the courts csii construe for the benefit
                                   of the Kankakee Drainage Company.
                              Mr. BOONE said the object of the sixteenth proviso was to wipe out
                                   the laws of 1869 and 1871.
                              His amendment was agreed to.
                              The report of the committee as amended was concurred in.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN moved to amend section twelve by striking out
                                   and inserting in lieu, after the word
                                   "statement" these words: "together
                                   with a detailed statement of the estimated cost in
                                   sections;" so that no assessments shall be a lien upon
                                   any tract of land for a greater sum than the estimated cost of
                                   the proposed works, or of making the repairs, etc., together with
                                   the necessary expenses of the company or association procuring
                                   such assessments, such expenses to be included in the statement
                                   of the estimated cost of the work.
                              The amendment was agreed to.
                              Mr. HUBBARD moved to amend the fifth section by making the articles
                                   of association evidence of the existence of the corporation in
                                   all courts in this State.
                              It was adopted.
                              He also moved to amend the same section by inserting the words
                                   "all persons who have paid their assessments in full may
                                   vote at any meeting of stockholders."
                              At the suggestion of Mr. BOONE the words, "on the question
                                   of repairs of such works" were added to the
                                   amendment.
                              The amendment as amended was then agreed to.
                              Mr. CHAPMAN moved to amend the thirteenth section by inserting
                                   appropriately the words, "in said county."
                              It was adopted.
                              Mr. HUBBARD moved the following: To further amend section 6 by
                                   inserting the words, "regular or adjourned" so
                                   that no notice need be given of such meeting; to further amend
                                   section 19 by inserting words requiring an affidavit from
                                   appraisers that they have personally examined the lands; to
                                   further amend section 13 by appropriately inserting the words,
                                   "appraisers shall be furnished with a copy of the plan
                                   and profile of their work."
                              These amendments were severally agreed to.
                              He also moved to amend section 21 by providing that unless such
                                   person be the owner of land, he shall present a bond.
                              This amendment was agreed to.
                              On motion of Mr. BROWN, the bill was ordered engrossed, and made
                                   the special order for to-morrow at ten o'clock, a.
                                   m.
                              Mr. HOUGH moved ineffectually for a suspension of the order of
                                   business that the bill [S. 2] in relation to private banking
                                   companies may be considered.
                              Mr. TAYLOR moved to suspend the order, to take up the bill [S. 5]
                                   providing that stock subscribed by counties to railroads, may be
                                   taken out of the control of County Commissioners and given to the
                                   men who paid the money.
                         
                         
                              EIGHT DOLLARS A DAY.
                              Mr. Brown moved to amend the motion so as to take up the bill [H.
                                   R. 73] as it proposes to increase his pay $3 a day.
                              The motion as amended was agreed to.
                              The bill [H. R. 73] fixing the per diem of members of the General
                                   Assembly, and providing they shall furnish their own stationery
                                   (eight dollars per day and five dollars for every twenty-five
                                   miles traveled) was passed to the second reading.
                         
                         
                              DISTRIBUTION OF RAILROAD STOCK TO TAX
                                   PAYERS.
                              On motion of Mr. BROWN, the bill [S. 5] to require railroad
                                   companies to issue stock to
                                   individual tax payers who have paid taxes in aid thereof to the
                                   amount of the tax so paid, the unclaimed stock to be issued to
                                   the Township Trustees, to be held in trust for the benefit of the
                                   commonschool fund, was read the second time.
                              On motion by Mr. NEFF, the word "paid" was
                                   substituted for the word "levied," so it will
                                   read, "after the tax was paid," intead of
                                   "after the tax was levied."
                              Mr. COLLETT and Mr. SLEETH proposed amendments, which were
                                   adopted.
                              The Constitutional rule was dispensed with, and the bill was read
                                   the third time and passed the Senate by yeas 45, nays 0, with an
                                   amendment of title.
                         
                         
                              TWENTY-SIXTH COMMON PLEAS.
                              Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence [Mr. Dwiggins in the chair] moved to
                                   suspend the order of business that the bill [S. 134] may be read
                                   the second time.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence moved to amend the bill [S. 134] to create
                                   the Twenty-sixth Judicial District of the Court of Common Pleas,
                                   by a provision regulating the terms of the Courts.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence moved that the bill be considered as
                                   engrossed, that the Constitutional requirement be dispensed with,
                                   and that the bill be read the third time now.
                              Mr. GLESSNER desired the bill should be referred to the Committee
                                   on the Organization of Courts.
                              Mr. SMITH moved that the bill be laid on the table and made the
                                   special order for to-morrow.
                              This motion was laid on the table--yeas 40, nays 4.
                              Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence's motion to dispense with the
                                   constitutional restriction was agreed to. The bill [S. 134] was
                                   then read the third time and passed the Senate by yeas 48, nays
                                   4, with an amendment of title, proposed by Mr. Friedley of
                                   Lawrence, declaring an emergency.
                              Mr. SCOTT, from the Committee on Education,
                                   returned the bill [H. R. 37] appropriating $8,000 for deficiency
                                   for the State University at Bloomington, with a recommendation
                                   that it pass.
                              The Report was concurred in.
                              The Senate then adjourned until to-morrow at 10
                                   o'clock.
                         
                         
                    
                    
                    
                         THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                         
                         THIRTEENTH VOLUME.
                         
                         INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
                         
                         HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                         
                              WEDNESDAY, December 11,1872.
                         
                         The House met at nine o'clock a. m.
                         Prayers by the Rev. Mr. Cornelius, of the Garden Baptist Church, of this
                              city.
                         On motion of Mr. GIVAN, the reading of the Journal of yesterday was
                              dispensed with, except the record of the vote on the final passage of
                              the bill [S. 85] to provide for the State bonds or stock [191] issued
                              prior to 1841, etc., and the record was corrected as to total
                              vote.
                         Mr. BLOCHER and Mr. BAKER desired to enter their votes in the negative
                              on the passage of said bill.
                         Mr. BUTTERWORTH moved for an order that the Journal Company be requested
                              to deliver their papers at seven o'clock in the morning, not
                              caring for its adoption, but to call attention to the matter, which he
                              supposed would be promptly corrected.
                         Mr. KIMBALL said the censure shall fall on those that distribute the
                              papers.
                         
                              ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION OF TAXES.
                              Mr. KIMBALL, from the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means, returned the committee's (printed)
                                   bill [H. R. 163] to provide for a uniform assessment of property
                                   and the collection and return of taxes thereon, with an
                                   amendment, the words "valuation and taxation"
                                   to follow "lots of land."
                              The amendment was adopted, and the bill ordered to the
                                   engrossment.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. This is a very important bill--the most important of
                                   the session. It is an entire revision of the assessment laws; and
                                   I think I am right in saying it will reach a revenue of three or
                                   four hundred thousand dollars without raising the taxes.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY. The various foreign insurance companies doing business
                                   in the State draw a million of dollars annually from our citizens
                                   for premiums, and I think some provision ought to be made for
                                   taxing their gross receipts. I am unwilling that this bill should
                                   pass without such a provision.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. With reference to insurance companies there is a
                                   special bill for taxing their receipts.
                              Mr. GIVAN. I see on page 50, section 180, of the printed bill, that
                                   there is a blank --.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. It is filled. I will state for the information of the
                                   House that the printer made several mistakes; but the bill has
                                   been critically examined by the committee, and the mistakes are
                                   all corrected.
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE. Is there a provision in the bill for the
                                   assessment of taxes on shares in banks or banking associations,
                                   or capital used for the purposes of banking in bonds of the
                                   United States, or otherwise? The private banks in Indianapolis
                                   alone hold hundreds of thousands of dollars in this way and do
                                   not return a dollar for taxation. I see no reason why there
                                   should be discrimination in their favor and against the national
                                   banks taxed for municipal purposes. I would like to reach these
                                   private banks.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. There is a provision for the assessment of shares in
                                   banking.
                              
                              On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the bill was referred again to the
                                   committee with instructions to report it to-morrow at ten
                                   o'clock as the special order.
                         
                         
                              FUNDED DEBTSTATE AGENT.
                              On motion of Mr. KIMBALL the bill [S. 141] in relation to the
                                   refunded debt of the State was taken up and read.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. This bill is like to that of the House on the third
                                   reading.
                              On motion the restrictions were removed and the bill was advanced
                                   to the third reading. The principal object of the bill is to
                                   abolish the office of Agent of State, and to transfer the State
                                   debt Sinking Fund to the General Fund. Its passage will save some
                                   $5,000 to the State annually.
                              The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives without
                                   amendment; yeas 88; nays 0.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. It strikes me that the title should express something
                                   more correctly in regard to the Agent of State, and it might be
                                   done by adding these words: "dispensing with the office
                                   of Agent of State." The bill is not to abolish the
                                   State's agency, but to dispense with the State Agent
                                   under the provisions of law.
                              It was so ordered by unanimous consent.
                              The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Auditor
                                   of State, transmitting advance copies of that part of hsi report
                                   in relation to the State debt and the duties of the Agent of
                                   State in relation thereto.
                              A message was received from the Governor announcing the signing of
                                   the House Bills for the completion of unfinished business of one
                                   session by the next succeeding session; for the amendment of the
                                   act establishing the House of Refuge, and the bill making
                                   specific appropriations. Also, that the House Joint Resolution in
                                   opposition to the division of the State into two Judicial
                                   Districts had been transmitted to our Senators and
                                   Representatives.
                         
                         
                              SALE OF PATENT RIGHTS.
                              The SPEAKER took up Mr. Miller's bill [H. R. 115] to
                                   repeal the act of April 23, 1869, to regulate the sale of patent
                                   rights, etc., in its order on the third reading.
                              Mr. MILLER. The act proposed to be repealed is in the Third Indiana
                                   Statutes, page 364. It took effect in 1869 without the signature
                                   of the Governor, It is a good law, but it is in contravention of
                                   the Constitution of the United States. It has been so decided,
                                   because the laws of Congress authorize any man who has received a
                                   patent to sell it in any of the States of the Union. The only
                                   trouble with the law is that it is a dead letter, and its
                                   enforcement makes a man liable for false imprisonment.
                              The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas, 88;
                                   nays, 0.
                         
                         
                              REGISTRATION OF BIRTHS, DEATHS AND
                                   MARRIAGES.
                              Mr. Lenfesty's bill [H. R. 88] to provide for the
                                   registration of births, deaths and marriages, was taken up on the
                                   third reading.
                              Mr. COBB. I like some of the provisions of this bill; and, as the
                                   revenue laws are to be changed, I move to recommit the bill to
                                   the Committee on the Judiciary, with
                                   instructions to amend it by striking opt the words
                                   "township assessors" whenever they occur in the
                                   bill, and insert the words "township trustees"
                                   in lieu, and make such other amendments as they may see
                                   proper.
                              Mr. LENFESTY. I am not really the author of the bill, although I
                                   introduced it. It was recommended to me by certain township
                                   officers. As I am informed that there will be an effort made here
                                   to create a bureau or board of statistics--a thing very much
                                   needed, that we may make a a complete showing to capitalists what
                                   are the resources of the State; and as I am very deeply
                                   interested in this bill, and as this matter is also in the other
                                   branch of the General Assembly, I concur in the motion.
                              And accordingly the bill was recommitted, with the proposed
                                   instructions.
                         
                         
                              DECEDENTS' ESTATES--WITNESSES.
                              Mr. WILSON of Ripley's bill [H. R. 118] making parties
                                   witnesses in reference to matters with executors and
                                   administrators, where contracts have been assigned to decedents,
                                   [which failed heretofore for lack of a constitutional majority]
                                   was again submitted to the vote.
                              Mr. WILSON defined it as providing that where contracts have been
                                   assigned to the decedent, and the assignor is living, he shall be
                                   a competent witness, and the defendant and the administrator
                                   shall also be competent witnesses as to matters between the
                                   assignor and the defendant.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN. I submit the point of order under our rules, that
                                   this bill having once failed for want of a constitutional
                                   majority, if it passes now it must be without debate.
                              The SPEAKER sustained the point, and the bill was finally passed
                                   the House of Representatives--yeas 51; nays 30.
                         
                         
                              TOWN SHADE TREES.
                              Mr. TULLEY'S bill [H. R. 128] empowering boards of
                                   trustees of incorporated towns to compel owners of lands to plant and maintain shade
                                   trees thereon, was taken up in order and finally passed--yeas 65;
                                   nays 15.
                              Mr. WOODARD submitted a motion to reconsider this vote.
                              Mr. OFFUTT had voted against this bill but if he had thought it
                                   would pass he would have voted for it, and made this motion
                                   himself to reconsider. It is wrong to compel owners of property
                                   to pay for mere ornamentations which they do not want. It is in
                                   derogation of common law rights. It ought not to pass for this
                                   reason. It would work hardship on small property owners if they
                                   are compelled to erect ornaments worth a hundred dollars or so.
                                   There is already a law to compel grading and sidewalks, which is
                                   right; there is utility in it; but to compel mere ornamentation
                                   is wrong.
                              Mr. WOODARD. We might with the same propriety say that every man in
                                   town shall build a brown stone house.
                              Mr. BAKER considered that the provisions of the act of March 14,
                                   1857, go far enough in this direction.
                              Mr. RENO concurred in this opinion.
                              Mr. LENFESTY. This bill provides that shade trees shall be supplied
                                   where the public convenience require them. The poor man could not
                                   be required to pay anything like the sum suggested. Three dollars
                                   will secure all the trees that could be required for three or
                                   four hundred dollars' worth of ground. The bill is
                                   right, and the vote should not be disturbed.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY did not think this bill a step beyond what should be
                                   the law in regard to shade trees. Nothing so cheap can add so
                                   much to the comfort and salubrity of any place.
                              Mr. TULLEY. The bill provides that shade trees shall be planted
                                   where, in the opinion of the board, they are requisite. It must
                                   be done by the will of a majority of the board. Shade trees are
                                   well worth their cost as a preventative against fire, and they
                                   are health promoting and a preventive of drouth.
                              Mr. BUTTERWORTH. The late fire which destroyed the business portion
                                   of our town (Mishawaka) was stopped at length by the shade
                                   trees.
                              Mr. BUSKIRK called attention to the fact that shade trees, by their
                                   purification of the atmosphere, are protective of public
                                   morality. Filth and vice go together, and cleanliness is a
                                   virtue. This consideration alone was sufficient to commend the
                                   bill to his mind.
                              On motion of Mr. GIFFORD, the motion to reconsider was laid on the
                                   table.
                         
                         
                              INDIANA UNIVERSITY.
                              Mr. Furnas' bill [H. R. 56], authorizing an annual
                                   appropriation of $20,000 to the State University, was read the
                                   third time.
                              Mr. GIVAN spoke in favor of the bill, holding that the people were
                                   in advance of the Legislature on this subject, and that the
                                   demand of the times was for placing the State University upon the
                                   ground contemplated by the act, establishing it at the head of
                                   our common school system.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY would oppose any further appropriations to colleges and
                                   higher institutions of learning while the common schools were
                                   unprovided for--so that the children should have the benefit of
                                   at least six months schooling in every year. Now in many country
                                   districts they are only afforded three or four months schooling
                                   annually. The higher institutions of learning were, as a rule,
                                   only available to those who have the ability to pay for a higher
                                   grade of education, and he would oppose any further
                                   appropriations to such institutions until every child in the
                                   State should be provided with the means of securing an elementary
                                   education.
                              Mr. RICHARDSON opposed the bill upon the same grounds.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. The State of Indiana should not neglect her
                                   University. The common school fund of Indiana is in excess of any
                                   other of the younger States of the Union. The State University
                                   occupies an enviable position in the eyes of the world, and it
                                   should be in the hearts of the people of Indiana. It is a part of
                                   the system of common schools, and I would be willing to
                                   appropriate the last dollar in the treasury to advance the
                                   interests of education. Nearly four millions of dollars in bonds
                                   of the United States constitute the common school fund of this
                                   State, and this, besides the tax of sixteen cents on the $100.
                                   And hence the common schools and the State University should have
                                   a corresponding higher point of advancement than they attain in
                                   those neighboring States. The University should not go down. It
                                   seems to me that every man ought to feel as I do about keeping it
                                   up.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. I am in favor of the passage of the bill. The
                                        Committee on Education is a prudent and
                                   an important committee, and I am willing to stand by the report
                                   they have made. Their conclusions give no evidence of flimsiness,
                                   but set forth actual needs of the University. This cause is
                                   mine--it is the cause of Indiana; and the University is her
                                   child. Shall we bastardize it and let it perish? or shall we give
                                   to it the support and fostering which it so much needs? Thomas
                                        Jefferson would have no
                                   other epitaph than this: "Here lies the author of the
                                   Declaration of Independence and the father of the University of
                                   Virginia."--When he had concluded--
                              Mr. MELLETT said the gentleman from Johnson has made my speech for
                                   the bill. The proposed appropriation would make the annual
                                   support of the University about thirty-six or thirty-seven
                                   thousand dollars; and this sum is less by nearly one half than
                                   the annual proceeds of the endowment of the Michigan State
                                   University. When he had concluded--
                              Mr. WILLARD demanded the previous question and there was a second
                                   to the demand. Under this pressure the bill was brought to the
                                   vote and failed again--Yeas 43, nays 44--for lack of the
                                   constitutional majority of all the members.
                              The House then took a recess till two o'clock p. m.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The House was called to order at two p.m. by the SPEAKER, who
                                   announced the special order, being the consideration of Mr.
                                   Heller's motion to reconsider the vote by which Mr.
                                   Wilson, of Ripley's bill [H. R. 73] to fix the per diem
                                   and mileage of members of the General Assembly at $8 a day,
                                   failed for want of the constitutional majority.
                              Mr. WOODARD moved a call of the House, which was ordered, and 85
                                   members responded to their names.
                              Mr. BRANHAM moved to dispense with further proceedings under the
                                   call; which was agreed to.
                              Mr. KIMBALL moved to dispense with the special order and take up
                                   his railroad bills 151 and 152.
                              The motion was rejected.
                              Mr. LENFESTY moved to lay Mr. Heller's motion to
                                   reconsider the vote by which the mileage bill [H. R. 73] failed
                                   to pass on the table.
                              Mr. OFFUTT demanded the yeas and nays, which resulted--yeas, 32;
                                   nays, 67. So that motion being rejected, the question recurred
                                   upon Mr. Heller's to reconsider the per diem bill.
                              The motion to reconsider was agreed to, and the question again
                                   recurred on the final passage of the per diem bill [H. R. 73.]
                                   The vote (which was taken without debate) resulted--yeas, 51;
                                   nays, 40, as follows:

                              So the bill was finally passed the House of Representatives.
                         
                         
                              RAILROAD RETURNS--TAXATION.
                              On motion of Mr. KIMBALL, his railroad returns bill [H. R. 151] to
                                   amend the act of March 11, 1867, was taken up, the question being
                                   on the third reading.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. All the change proposed to be made in the late law is
                                   this: it proposes to change the time of making their reports to
                                   the Auditor from the 10th of January to the first Tuesday in
                                   February. It also fixes a penalty. Hitherto the law has been
                                   without penalty, and the
                              On motion by Mr. STEELE, this motion was laid on the table.
                              Mr. NEFF, as a general proposition, was opposed to the creation of
                                   new circuits, but was satisfied some relief is needed in the
                                   district affected by this bill, and for this reason alone he
                                   should favor its passage.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS demanded the previous question.
                              The demand was seconded by the Senate, and under its operations the
                                   constitutional requirement was not dispensed with--yeas 30, nays
                                   11--two-thirds not voting in the affirmative.
                         
                         
                              INDIANA UNIVERSITY.
                              Mr. SCOTT made a motion to suspend the regular order, that the bill
                                   [H. R. 37] making an appropriation of $8,000 to pay a deficiency
                                   created in 1870 and 1871 by the Indiana University at Bloomington
                                   might be taken up.
                              The motion was agreed to, and accordingly the bill was read the
                                   second time.
                              Mr. TAYLOR moved to amend by adding an appropriation of $100,000 to
                                   the Purdue University. He urged the adoption of his amendment,
                                   giving reasons therefor, among others, that this would in all
                                   probability, be the last time that the Institution will ask for
                                   State aid.
                              This amendment was opposed by Messrs. Dittemore, Orr, Daggy and
                                   Harney.
                              Mr. DAGGY made a motion that the bill and amendments be referred to
                                   the Committee on Public Expenditures.
                              Mr. TAYLOR asked and obtained leave to withdraw his amendment.
                              
                              On motion by Mr. BROWN the motion to recommit the bill was laid on
                                   the table.
                              Mr. SCOTT moved to dispense with the constitutional restriction
                                   that the bill may be read the third time now and put upon its
                                   passage.
                              The motion was agreed to by yeas, 34; nays, 10.
                              Accordingly the bill [H. R. 37] making an appropriation of $8,000
                                   to the Indiana State University at Bloomington, to pay a debt
                                   incurred in the years 1870 and 1871, was read the third and last
                                   time in the Senate.
                              Mr. HARNEY declared that he would have to vote against the bill,
                                   not because of unfriendliness to the University, but because he
                                   opposed the principle embodied in the bill.
                              Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence [Mr. Dwiggins in the chair] spoke in favor
                                   of the bill--hoping it would meet with no serious opposition.
                              The bill was then finally passed by yeas 37; nays 5, with an
                                   amendment of title.
                              The PRESIDENT pro tem., announced the special order, being Mr.
                                   Chapman's drainage bill [S. 88.]
                         
                         
                              EIGHT DOLLARS A DAY FOR MEMBERS.
                              On motion by Mr. BROWN its consideration was postponed until two
                                   and a half o'clock, p. m., in order that the bill [H. R.
                                   73] increasing the per diem of members $3 may be considered
                                   now.
                              On motion of Mr. DITTEMORE, the bill [H. R. 73] fixing the per diem
                                   of members of the General Assembly at eight dollars per day, and
                                   five dollars for every twenty-five miles travel, was read the
                                   second time.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE moved to dispense with the constitutional
                                   restriction, that the bill may be advanced at once to its final
                                   reading, and passed to-day.
                              Mr. HARNEY understood by the Treasurer that there are over sixty
                                   employes in the Senate, and there should be some restriction to
                                   this evil placed in this bill.
                              Mr. BROWN demanded the previous question.
                              The Senate seconded the demand for the previous question, and under
                                   the operation thereof, the motion to dispense with the
                                   constitutional restriction was not agreed to--yeas 28, nays
                                   17--two-thirds not voting in the affirmative.
                         
                         
                              VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATIONS.
                              Mr. STEELE made a motion to suspend the order of business that the
                                   bill [S. 3] to authorize voluntary accociations to borrow money
                                   to complete unfinished buildings might be taken up.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Accordingly the bill [S. 3] to amend section 4 of the act of
                                   February 20, 1857, concerning the organization of voluntary
                                   associations, and repealing each act repealed by said act, was
                                   read the second time.
                              Mr. STEELE moved for a dispensation of the Constitutional provision
                                   that the bill may be passed to its final reading in the
                                   Senate.
                              The motion was agreed to by yeas 41, nays 2.
                              Accordingly the bill was read the third time and passed by yeas 46,
                                   nays 0.
                         
                         
                              TWENTY-THIRD COMMON PLEAS.
                              Mr. RHODES made a motion to suspend the regular order that the bill
                                   [S. 68] to amend the second section of the act of May 11, 1867,
                                   creating the Twenty-third Common Pleas District--affecting the
                                   counties of Tippecanoe and Warren, may be read the second
                                   time.
                              The motion was agreed to, and the bill being read--
                              He moved for a dispensation that the bill may be pressed to the
                                   final reading now.
                              This motion was agreed to by yeas 41, nays 2.
                              Accordingly the bill was read the third time and passed by yeas 45,
                                   nays 0.
                              Mr. BEARDSLEY, by leave, introduced a bill [S. 145] in relation to
                                   the organization of the two Houses of the General Assembly, and
                                   regulating the number of assistants to be employed by each of the
                                   officers thereof.
                              [The author says this bill will save $20,000 each session.]
                              It was read the first time and passed to the second reading.
                              And then came the recess till two o'clock.

                              The Senate reassembled at two p. m.
                         
                         
                              CHARGES AGAINST STATE OFFICIAL
                              Mr. CARNAHAN offered a resolution authorizing the
                                        Committee on Finance to make
                                   investigation into charges preferred against the present and late
                                   Treasurers present and late Auditors of State and others with
                                   reference to the loan of the public school fund contrary to law,
                                   and report the result of the investigations to the Senate. It is
                                   as follows:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             WHEREAS, It has been charged
                                                  through the public press and otherwise that John
                                                  I. Morrison and Nathan Kimball, late Treasurers of
                                                  State, James B. Ryan, present Treasurer, Thomas B.
                                                  McCarty and John D. Evans, late Auditors of State,
                                                  and John C. Shoemaker, present Auditor, have
                                                  loaned, deposited, and other- wise used the public
                                                  funds contrary to law, therefore--
                                             RESOLVED, That the
                                                  Committee on Finance be
                                                  derected to make such investigation in relation
                                                  thereto as the public interest and exigencies of
                                                  the case may seem to require, and report the
                                                  result of their examination to the Senate.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Mr. BROWN moved to change the reference of the resolution to the
                                   special committee heretofore appointed to inquire why the sinking
                                   fund had not been distributed according to law, and to ascertain
                                   what amount of interest had been collected on the same, and what
                                   had been done with it.
                              [A message was here received from the Governor, announcing the
                                   signing of Senate bills 8, 38 and 124.]
                              Some discussion ensued upon the question of courtesy in taking the
                                   matter from the select committee, Mr. Dittemore favoring and Mr.
                                   Carnahan opposing the reference to the select committee.
                              Mr. BROWN moved to further amend by striking from the resolution
                                   all reforence of former Treasurers and Auditors, on the ground
                                   that they are now defendants in suits instituted against them on
                                   the relation of the State.
                              Mr. THOMPSON hoped this investigation would not be pressed in this
                                   way. He was satidfied the whole thing grew out of a spirit of
                                   persecution, and a desire to break down old parties and create
                                   newparty divisions. It was easy to find charges railroads have
                                   made no reports, and so we find ourselves at fault as to the
                                   valuation of their property for taxation. It is a very important
                                   matter that these reports should be had by the State.
                              Mr. BAKER. I would like to see the bill amended so as to read $25
                                   per day, instead of $100 for each day's delay of their
                                   report.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. There are many railroads that would rather pay $25 a
                                   day than give in their report.
                              The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas 81,
                                   nays 1. Mr. Kimball's bill [H. R. 152] to amend the act
                                   to provide for the incorporation of railroad companies, approved
                                   May 11, 1852, was taken up on the third reading.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. The object of this bill is the same as that of the
                                   other act. It makes no change in the law except the date of the
                                   returns from the 10th of January to the first Tuesday in
                                   February, and fixes penalties. It is to give the State
                                   information for the basis of railroad taxation.
                              And then the bill was finally passed the House of
                                   Representatives--yeas 86, nays 2.
                         
                         
                              REPEAL OF THE CORPORATION DRAINAGE ACT.
                              On motion of Mr. BUTTERWORTH, the bill [S. 1] to repeal the
                                   corporation drainage act of 1869, and the supplemental act of
                                   1871, was taken up and read the first time, and on his further
                                   mottion (the constitutional restriction being removed for the
                                   purpose) the bill finally passed the House--yeas 89, nays 0.
                              On motion of Mr. OGDEN, the title was amended by adding these
                                   words: "And saving from the operation of this act all
                                   companies the line of whose works is sixteen miles and
                                   under."
                              [The provisions of the foregoing bill differ from those of the
                                   House bill passed on Tuesday only in excepting from its operation
                                   companies whose lines of ditching do not exceed sixteen miles in
                                   length.]
                         
                         
                              SUPREME COURT JUDGES--DISTRICT.S
                              The bill [S. 51] to amend section 1 of the act to authorize a
                                   Supreme Court, and prescribe certain duties of the judges
                                   thereof, approved May 13, 1852, was taken up on the first
                                   reading.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN. This bill provides for an additional Judge of the
                                   Supreme Court without redistricting the State. On his motion, the
                                   constitutional restrictions were suspended, and the bill
                                   passed--yeas 85, nays 0.
                              The bill [S. 52] to divide the State into five Supreme Court
                                   Judicial Districts, and for the appointment of an additional
                                   Judge of the Supreme Court, was taken up on the first reading.
                                   [It provides for the appointment by the Governor of a Judge for
                                   the fifth Supreme Court District, to serve until his successor
                                   shall be elected and qualified.]
                              On motion of Mr. CAUTHORN (the restrictions being suspended for the
                                   purpose) the bill was advanced to final reading. Mr. Cauthorn
                                   proposed to amend in the first section by striking put
                                   "Parke" and inserting "Vigo"
                                   in lieu, and by striking out "Vigo" and
                                   inserting "Parke" in lieu.
                              Mr. WOODARD moved to lay the amendment on the table.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN. The object of this amendment is to make the districts
                                   out of counties adjoining. It don't amount to anything
                                   else and it would be satisfactory to the Judges.
                              Mr. Speaker EDWARDS (Mr. Offutt in the chair) joined the gentleman
                                   from Parke (Mr. Woodard) in his objection to the proposed change;
                                   to make it would be only to send the bill back to the Senate.
                              The amendment was laid on the table, and then the bill was finally
                                   past the House. Yeas 82, nays 4.

                              Mr. CAUTHORN (by unanimous consent) introduced a bill [H. R. 226]
                                   for an act to amend the 453d section of the Practice act of June

                                                  Judiciary Committee be
                                                  instructed to inquire into the truth of the
                                                  matters alleged on said suit, and report the
                                                  result of such investigation with whatever
                                                  recommendation they may deem proper.
                                        
                                   
                              
                         
                         
                              STATE PRINTER.
                              Mr. WOODARD submitted a preamble and resolutions, reciting that the
                                   Auditor of State alleges that large amounts of money, more than
                                   is necessary, have been paid out for public printing within the
                                   last eight years; and that there is now in the hands of the
                                        Committee on Printing a bill to abolish
                                   the office of State Printer; and therefore requiring said
                                   committee to report said bill to the House without delay for
                                   action thereon.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY said he introduced the bill referred to in the
                                   resolution, and had prepared a similar order for its return to
                                   the House. He rehearsed the provisions of his bill to abolish the
                                   office of State Printer, and require the Governor, Secretary,
                                   Auditor, and Treasurer of State to let the State's
                                   printing to the lowest responsible bidder. He alleged the
                                   existence of charges of fraud against the Public Printers of the
                                   State chosen by both political parties, which justified the
                                   effort to abolish the office, and the statement which he himself
                                   had made, that it was more an office of public robbery than of
                                   public printing.
                              When he had concluded the House adjourned.
                         
                         
                    
                    
                    
                         THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                         
                         THIRTEENTH VOLUME.
                         
                         INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
                         
                         IN SENATE.
                         
                              THURSDAY, December 12, 1872.
                         
                         The Senate met at ten o'clock, pursuant to adjournment.
                         After prayer by the Rev. Mr. Spratt, of the M. E. Church, in which he
                              mentioned particularly the subject of temperance--
                         On motion of Mr. STEELE, the reading of the Secretary's journal
                              was dispensed with.
                         
                              TWENTY-SECOND JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.
                              The Senate proceeded to the consideration of the special order for
                                   this hour, being the bill [H. R. 49] creating the Twenty-second
                                   Judicial Circuit of this State to be composed of the counties
                                   Miami, Wabash and Huntington.
                              The bill was read the second time.
                              Mr. STEELE reasoned in favor of the passage of the bill, and moved
                                   that it be considered as engrossed, and that the constitutional
                                   restriction be suspended in order that it may be finally passed
                                   upon now.
                              Mr. DAUGHERTY moved to refer the bill to the Committee on
                                        Organization of Courts.
                              against any public man based upon rumors growing out of the heated
                                   debates of a political canvass.
                              Mr. CARNAHAN moved ineffectually to lay the amendment on the
                                   table--yeas, 20; nays, 23.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS protested that this action, striking out the provision
                                   for the investigation into the official conduct of the former
                                   officers and retaining it as to the present officers--was not
                                   fair treatment of the minority. He asked the Senators to lay the
                                   question to their hearts and say if they had done justly in the
                                   matter. He hoped the resolution would pass without showing the
                                   hand so plain as this vote indicates. Every investigation asked
                                   for so far had been passed almost unanimously, and now he hoped
                                   that the Senate would not rest content with this vote. If there
                                   is nothing wrong why shrink from an investigation; and why now
                                   investigate charges against two persons and let four others
                                   go?
                              Mr. BROWN explained that the four names he proposed to strike out
                                   were now in court having a judicial examination into the very
                                   things this resolution referred to, while the two persons, the
                                   present officials, are not in court. As a go between--not
                                   belonging to any party he did not take to himself any part of the
                                   lecture of the Senator from Knox. His object had been to relieve
                                   the gentlemen excepted by his amendment from an investigation
                                   during the pendency of the suits in which they were defendants.
                                   He thought an investigation by a Marion County Court, in which
                                   the cases were prosecuted by the ablest legal gentlemen in the
                                   State, would be sufficient in their case. Like the Indianapolis
                                        Sentinel, having now no politics and never
                                   expecting to have any, he repudiated the charge that it was
                                   designed to persecute or exculpate any one.
                              Mr. GLESSNER thought the ex-officers were entitled to the benefits
                                   of a full investigation. He believed they were hon- orable gentlemen. The State top
                                   should have the benefit of the investigation. The suits referred
                                   to were instituted to recover money alleged to have been received
                                   on interest from deposit of the public funds. They were to
                                   ascertain a legal point merely. He favored the passage of the
                                   resolution that the parties interested may have an opportunity to
                                   vindicate their good name--a right which should be accorded to
                                   them; inasmuch as the suits may never be determined, or may be
                                   stricken off the court dockets to-morrow; and for other reasons
                                   which he named.
                              Mr. HOUGH offered the following substitute for the pending
                                   resolution:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             WHEREAS, In the opinion of the
                                                  Senate, there is a a great deal of looseness in
                                                  the manner in which the tightness of the strings
                                                  of the public purse is kept: and
                                             WHEREAS An increase in the
                                                  tightness of the looseness aforesaid, is a thing
                                                  greatly to be desired: therefore
                                             RESOLVED, That a committee of
                                                  some unascertainable number be appointed to
                                                  investigate the looseness of the tightness
                                                  aforesaid, and report by bill or otherwise.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              On motion of Mr. ARMSTRONG the whole subject was laid on the
                                   table.
                              Mr. GLESSNER moved to reconsider the vote of several days since
                                   adopting the resolution offered by Mr. Dittemore, to investigate
                                   why the $560,000 school fund was not distributed under the law
                                   requiring it.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE opposed the motion.
                              Mr. HOUGH moved to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.
                              This motion'was agreed to by yeas 34, nays, 9.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS, by consent, substituted the bill [S. 49] to amend
                                   section 22 of the town incorporation act of June 11, 1852,
                                   instead of the bill [S. 56] reported from the Committee
                                        on Corporations, submitted several days since.
                              It being a favorable recommendation, the report was concurred
                                   in.
                              On motion by Mr. BROWN, the bill [S. 17] was taken from the table
                                   and placed on the files.
                              Mr. GOODING offered a resolution for the appointment of a special
                                   committee of three to investigate the needs of the office of
                                   Secretary of State.
                              It was adopted.
                         
                         
                              RAILROAD FREIGHT CHARGES.
                              Mr. HUBBARD (in the chair) announced the consideration of the bill
                                   [S. 115] to prevent extortionate charges for freight transported
                                   over railroads in this State.
                              It was read the second time.
                              Mr. SCOTT moved to amend by adding the words to section 2,
                                   "nor when compensation allowed by law shall be less than
                                   the amount so offered" for carrying freight--shall not
                                   be liable to a penalty.
                              Mr. BROWN explained that as the law now is, a party can not bring
                                   suit against a railroad for extortion, because the company will
                                   plead a contract. He opposed the amendment, and concluded his
                                   remarks by moving to lay the amendment on the table.
                              The motion was agreed to, and after some debate the bill finally
                                   passed--yeas 38, nays 4, as follows:

                              Mr. WADGE explained his affirmative vote because this bill is a
                                   move in the direction of protecting the people against the
                                   extortion of railroad companies, though he very much disliked the
                                   provisions in sections 6 and 7.
                              The result of the vote was then announced as above.
                         
                         
                              CITY TAXATION.
                              Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN moved to suspend the regular order to take up the
                                   bill [S. 10] to amend section 58 of the general city
                                   incorporation law of March 14, 1867. If passed it would save a
                                   very important law suit in his county, and was a measure very
                                   much desired by the citizens of his county. The bill authorizes
                                   the taxation of all lands inside the city limits.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              The bill was read the second time, the constitutional rule
                                   suspended, and the bill read the third time and passed--yeas, 31;
                                   nays, 8.
                              Mr. DAGGY offered a resolution providing that in future the
                                   business of the Senate shall be conducted in the regular order as
                                   provided by the rules.
                              It was adopted.
                         
                         
                              DRAINAGE OF WET LANDS.
                              Mr. CHAPMAN moved to take up bill 88, which had been made the
                                   special order for 2:30 p. m.
                              Mr. HUBBARD, from the Committee on Engrossed
                                        Bills, reported back bill 88, (the special order)
                                   to encourage the construction of levees, dykes and drains.
                              Mr. BOONE asked and obtained unanimous consent offerto an amendment
                                   pro- viding that no suit for
                                   the recovery of assessments shall be commenced after a lapse of
                                   five years from the time of recording the schedule.
                              The amendment was agreed to.
                              The bill was read the third time and passed--yeas, 36; nays, 5.
                              The Senate then adjourned.

                         HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                         
                              THURSDAY, December 12, 1872.
                         
                         The House was called to order at nine o'clock by the Speaker,
                              and prayer was offered by Mr. Clark, a representative from Hamilton
                              county.
                         On motion of Mr. Lenfesty, the reading of the journal of yesterday was
                              dispensed with.
                         
                              THE ASSESSMENT LAWS.
                              Mr. KIMBALL, from the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means, reported back the bill [H. R. 163] to
                                   provide for a uniform assessment of property and for the
                                   collection and return of taxes thereon, with amendments. First,
                                   add to section 62: "Provided that shares of the State
                                   Bank and of the National Banks shall not be listed for taxation
                                   for municipal purposes till the expiration of the charter of the
                                   State, October 1,1876." Second, insert in section 49;
                                   "The number of mules, jacks and jennies, and their
                                   value."
                              Mr. KIMBALL [replying to Mr. Gfven] said the Committee found that
                                   it was necessary to exempt National Bank stock from municipal
                                   taxation in order to protect vested rights and avoid litigation.
                                   Such taxation would be in conflict with section 15 of the State
                                   Bank charter. And section 71 of that charter provides that no
                                   change shall be made therein without the consent of the President
                                   and Directors. It would conflict with the act of Congress
                                   authorizing National Banks.
                              Mr. GIVAN. I understand that the act of Congress establishing
                                   National Banks has been so amended that its stocks may be taxed
                                   for municipal and county purposes.
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE. That amendment was not to admit of their taxation
                                   for municipal purposes, but for county purposes. The courts in
                                   the Eleventh, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Indiana Reports have
                                   settled this matter. The law of Congress creating the National
                                   Banks provides that they shall not be taxed in excess of the
                                   stocks of the State Banks wherein they are located.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY could not see the necessity for continuing the
                                   exemption of the National Banks till 1876. Having hardly seen a
                                   note of the circulation of the State Bank for six or eight years,
                                   it is time we should be relieved from the law that exempts
                                   National Banks on account of a provision of the charter of the
                                   State Bank. The State Bank Charter is utterly a dead letter on
                                   the statute book, and ought to be wiped out, so as not to affect
                                   the National Bank system. What is the use of a State Bank to-day?
                                   We ought to take some steps to tax the National Banks for
                                   municipal purposes. I am in favor of removing this pretence. I
                                   believe it to be merely technical--not well founded. Governor
                                   Baker has twice recommened this taxation of National Banks. These
                                   banks are each year exempted from taxation on their stocks to the
                                   extent of hundreds of thousands, and if you tax them it will be
                                   just the saving of the tax on that sum to the people, and I am in
                                   favor of enforcing this tax now.
                              
                              Mr. BAXTER stated that there are seventy of these banks in
                                   operation in the State, and reading from the National
                                   Bank's charter the clause for their exemption, he said
                                   those who have gone into these National Banks have gone into them
                                   with that understanding.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN. The subject of the taxation of National Bank stocks
                                   has been discussed in this House before, in other sessions, and
                                   it is a dangerous question to make a record on. Bills proposing
                                   to tax this stock have been strangled in committee, and some
                                   Democrats had made a record on this question, and met the
                                   consequences of the popular condemnation. This was a tender
                                   question. Those opposed to this taxation affect to believe that
                                   it is not constitutional to tax them for municipal purposes. But
                                   if there is really any doubt about this, what are we afraid of?
                                   This legislation is for the benefit of the people, and I prefer
                                   to tax them, and let them take the question to the courts. But I
                                   am not convinced that it is unconstitutional. Governor Baker in
                                   his messages of 1869 and 1871, says we can tax them, and that
                                   they ought to be taxed for municipal purposes. The men that own
                                   these stocks are men of wealth. You make laws to compel men to
                                   pay taxes on all they have. Then why will you exempt these men,
                                   these sharpers, who are making their thousands by loaning money?
                                   We propose not to tax them more than, but only to pay taxes as
                                   other men.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. There is not a man on the committee but wants to tax
                                   these banks, if we can; but we regard the attempt as against the
                                   constitution and the decisions of the Supreme Court.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN continuing. I do not know that the question has ever
                                   been before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of the United
                                   States has decided that we can tax these National Banks. All
                                   these National Banks are locted in the cities and towns, and
                                   according to the last semi-annual statement before me, the total
                                   of their capital amounts to about sixty-eight millions of
                                   dollars. How much would that realize in taxes? these
                                   millions--gentlemen, can make the calculation for themselves.
                                   Then it will be found that these National Banks stocks are owned
                                   nearly all by New Yorkers and foreigners, and through these banks
                                   they are enjoying the protection and benefits of our own laws and
                                   institutions without paying anything for it. It is nothing but
                                   fair that they shonld be taxed as others. But, as I hinted, this
                                   proposition in the Legislature to tax them has been brought to
                                   grief, and the men here who aided in that result have been
                                   rebuked by the people. And where there is doubt, I prefer to give
                                   the benefit to the people.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY was surprised at the inconsistency of the course of
                                   gentlemen (Mr. Satterwhite and Mr. Kimball) voting to increase
                                   the per diem and to exempt the banks from taxation. The gentleman
                                   from Morgan (Mr. Satterwhite) in my own county promised my people
                                   that he would vote for a bill to tax National Banks; and now he
                                   is hiding himself behind a quibble. I prefer to take the opinion
                                   of Governor Baker, who is a good lawyer. I concur also with the
                                   gentleman from Knox (Mr. Cauthorn) when he says he would give the
                                   people the benefit of the doubt. I desire to treat the
                                        Committee on Banks and the
                                        Committee on Ways and Means with all
                                   proper respect whilst I say let us do what Governor Baker has
                                   told us to do, and if there is any legal doubt involved in our
                                   act let that be decided by the proper tribunals. I say to
                                   gentlemen that there is injustice in our negligence in this
                                   matter. As to the question of justice in the matter no man can
                                   doubt. We know that it is just and proper and right that these
                                   banks should pay their equal share of the taxes. I don't
                                   want to constitute our committees as judges of the law. Let the
                                   House come forward and do what the Governor has repeatedly
                                   recommended.
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE. The gentleman intimates that I am going back on my
                                   promise to my people. This is not the case however. As to my
                                   action here I am only anxious to avoid vexatious law suits and
                                   expensive future legislation, and there is a rule of the House in
                                   my favor--the gentleman has no right here to call in question my
                                   motives. But, as I have said, it is futile in the extreme to
                                   attempt here to tax these banks for municipal purposes. The
                                   question has been settled in three cases. The gentleman intimated
                                   that there is no mother bank of the State of Indiana; but he is
                                   entirely mistaken in this also. There is one in this city with a
                                   capital of $300,000, besides others.
                              Mr. BUTTERWORTH. What connection is there between the State and the
                                   National Banks?
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE. There is an act of Congress which provides that
                                   the tax on the National Banks shall not be greater than the tax
                                   on the State banks, in the States where they are located. I would
                                   legislate so as to avoid litigation.
                              In face of the decisions of the Supreme Court, given in three
                                   separate cases, it is folly
                                   to attempt to tax these stocks for municipal purposes now. The
                                   National Banks are now paying taxes equal to 3 1/2 per cent.,
                                   while other property does not average more than 1 1/2.
                              Mr. BAXTER had voted against the per diem bill because he believed
                                   it unjust to his constituents. He believed in taxing banks but
                                   wanted to wait till it could be done legally. He had not seen any
                                   one attempting to lobby on behalf of the banks. These banks,
                                   instead of bleeding the people as alleged by the gentleman from
                                   Knox, had been a blessing to the country. He read from the law
                                   chartering the State Bank, to show it was exempt from municipal
                                   taxes, and from the law creating National Banks, to show that
                                   they should be taxed only as other banks, and contended that
                                   there could be no question as to the illegality of the proposed
                                   tax.
                              Mr, BRANHAM said the committee had been unanimous in their report,
                                   but in order to put the responsibility where it properly belonged
                                   he moved to strike from the amendment that part relating to the
                                   National Banks and shares of stock in the National Banks, and let
                                   the courts decide when appealed to.
                              Mr. GIVAN said he did not favor the taxation of National Banks
                                   because they were wealthy, but simply because he favored equal
                                   taxation, and wanted all who shared the protection of the
                                   government to bear equal share in the burden of its support.
                              The motion to strike from the amendment that part relating to
                                   National Banks was agreed to.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. There can be no question that he State Banks are
                                   exempted, and there is no use of a clause to exempt them. We
                                   might as well reject the whole of the amendment in relation to
                                   banks. I make that motion.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. If there is no mistake about the time when the State
                                   Bank Charter expires.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. The real estate of the State banks is taxable as other
                                   property: hence, if it is left to the officers, they will put
                                   such of this property on the tax lists as are taxable; and the
                                   National Banks are taxable in the same way. So I think the
                                   amendment can be of no use
                              Mr. CAUTHORN. I agree with the gentleman from Johnson, that the
                                   amendment is of no use. But I propose to tax these banks
                                   according to the recommendation of Governor Baker. Mr. C. then
                                   read from the Governor's Messages, of 1869, and 1871,
                                   recommending the taxation of National Banks as other property for
                                   municipal purpose, and his reasoning thereon--and proceeded. The
                                   Governor tells us very plainly that we can tax these National
                                   Banks for municipal purposes. I think the Governor is right and I
                                   propose to follow his advice. I don't think these banks
                                   themselves are very clear in their reasoning on this question of
                                   the unconstitutionality of such legislation. For if they are
                                   firmly and well persuaded of the correctness of their position,
                                   why are they so tender about it if we can't tax them?
                                   Why are they expending their thousands of dollars in attempting
                                   to prevent such legislation, if they really think we
                                   can't so legislate? I propose, therefore, to take
                                   responsibility and make this legislation; and let them go to the
                                   courts with the question.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. I am determined that gentlemen shall not place us on
                                   the record as opposed to taxing the National Banks or any other
                                   banks; and as to the alleged attempts of the banks to prevent
                                   such legislation by money, I will affirm here, that there is not
                                   one member of the Committee on Ways and Means
                                   that any man will dare to approach corruptly. I am in favor of
                                   taxing them, and with respect to the amendment the House will
                                   take its own course. I am glad to see that the gentleman from
                                   Knox (Mr. Cauthorn) attaches so much importance to the messages
                                   of Governor Baker.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN'S motion to further amend the amendment of the
                                   committee by striking out the clause respecting the State Banks
                                   was adopted.
                              The question recurred on the adoption of the committee amendments,
                                   as amended and they were adopted.
                              And so the report of the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means was concurred in.
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE submitted further amendments to the bill, viz.:
                              "Add to Section 57 the following paragraph:"
                              It shall be the duty of the President or other principal officer of
                                   every private bank in the State, to make out, in addition to the
                                   other property required to be listed by this act, a statement
                                   under oath, showing the amount of capital of such bank, and the
                                   name and residenco of the owner or owners thereof, and the
                                   proportionate part or share of such capital owned by each, and
                                   the par or cash value thereof, which shares shall be assessed
                                   against such persons the same as other personal property, and
                                   without allowing dednctions therefrom, and the same shall be
                                   entered up for taxation accordingly."
                              Also, the following:
                              "The affidavit to the schedule in Section 49 shall be
                                   amended as follows: The words, 'excepting property not
                                   taxable or otherwise specifically taxed,' shall follow
                                   the words, 'All personal property held or belonging to
                                   me.'"
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. It seems to me that the act provides for that.
                              
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE. The section providing for the taxation of their
                                   banking propert does not provide for taxing all their other
                                   property besides.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. It seems to me that there is no mercy for the private
                                   banks as they are organized now. In this bill it is provided that
                                   every man shall give in all he has.
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE, I am fixing that so as to meet the future.
                              Mr. S.'s amendments were rejected, and the question
                                   recurred on the engrossment of the bill.
                              On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the bill was considered as engrossed and
                                   put upon its passage.
                              The bill, as amended, was read the third time by the Clerk.
                              Mr. BAKER demanded a call of the House, which was ordered, and 82
                                   members answered to their names.
                              On motion of Mr. CAUTHORN, further proceedings under the call were
                                   dispensed with.
                              The final vote resulted--yeas 85, nays 2, as follows:

                              So the bill passed the House of Representatives.
                         
                         
                              NEW BUSINESS.
                              Mr. GlFFORD introduced a bill 227, to provide for the payment to
                                   Township Trustees of certain moneys.
                              It was referred to the Judiciary Committee.
                              Mr. WALKER introduced a resolution reciting the neglect of the
                                        special committee on heating and ventilation of the
                                        hall to attend to their duty, and providing for
                                   raising a second committee to warm up the committee.
                              Mr. OFFUTT moved that the matter be referred to a committee of one,
                                   and that the member from Wayne be made chairman of that
                                   committee.
                              It was agreed to.
                              Mr. KIRKPATRICK introduced a bill 228, to amend the act in relation
                                   to disabilities of Circuit Judges
                              It was referred to the Judiciary Committee.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN offered a resolution directing the Speaker to draw his
                                   warrant upon the Treasurer in favor of W. M. Merwin and ------
                                   for the amount allowed them by resolution of the House.
                              It was adopted.
                         
                         
                              THE OFFICE OF STATE PRINTER.
                              Mr. STANLEY called attention to the fact that the resolution of Mr.
                                   Woodard, offered Wednesday afternoon, at the adjournment had not
                                   been acted on.
                              The resolution was taken up, when Mr. BILLINGSLEY, Chairman of the
                                        Committee on Printing, explained that the
                                   delay in reporting back the bill to abolish the office of State
                                   Printer had arisen from the fact that the committee were debating
                                   the means to be adopted for providing for the public
                                   printing.
                              Mr. BRANHAM moved that the committee be excused from attendance on
                                   the sessions of the House, in order that they might have an
                                   opportunity to attend to the business before them.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY moved to amend by requiring them to report back both
                                   bills in their hands to-morrow morning.
                              The motion was agreed to, and then Mr. Branham's motion,
                                   as amended, was adopted.
                         
                         
                              SAVINGS BANKS.
                              Mr. RIGG'S bill [H. R. 198] to amend the act of May 12,
                                   1869, providing for the incorporation of savings banks, was read
                                   the third time; and, on motion of Mr. SATTERWHITE (by unanimous
                                   consent), it was referred back to the Committee on
                                        Banks, with instructions to amend.
                              Mr. RUMSEY'S bill [H. R. 90], touching public schools in
                                   towns on grounds laid out, platted, and regarded as public
                                   grounds not dedicated, and matters therewith connected, was taken
                                   up in order on the third reading. Mr. R. said: The object is to
                                   devote undedicated public grounds in the towns of the State to
                                   the schools, in accordance with the wishes of the people of the
                                   towns. In his town there was such a public square given to the
                                   town twenty years ago, which has been used as a lumber yard,
                                   until recently the people have taken possession of it, built a
                                   school house on it, and are now using it for school purposes. He
                                   hoped the bill would pass. It would legalize their action.
                              The bill finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas, 80;
                                   nays, 0.
                         
                         
                              HOLIDAYS.
                              Mr. BUSKIRK'S bill [H. R. 64] making holidays of January
                                   1, July 4, December 25,
                                   Thanksgiving nays, and general election days, was read the third
                                   time.
                              Mr. BUSKIRK. It is to make legal holidays of the days specified;
                                   and it provides that commercial and bank papers maturing on any
                                   of these days shall mature, in the eye of the law, on the day
                                   previous.
                              Mr. COBB. It seems to me it would be better to leave the laws
                                   without change in this respect; because, for example, if the law
                                   here is different from the law in Massachusetts, there will be
                                   difficulty when the protest is not made on the legal day. Why
                                   encumber the statute with it? It can not change the common law.
                                   It would be injurious only to the people of this State. It would
                                   not affect outsiders.
                              Mr. MILLER. I think we need this legislation to establish the legal
                                   holidays--as it has been taken in most of the States of the
                                   Union. There are other days besides Sundays in which people do
                                   not engage in the ordinary avocations of life; and commercial men
                                   ought to be able to devote their whole time to the holidays as
                                   well as other people. I do not think, so far as paper drawn in
                                   Indiana and payable in another State is concerned, that there can
                                   be any difficulty, because the law of the place where the
                                   contract is made binds in the case. It can not be a dangerous
                                   innovation.
                              The bill finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas 55, nays
                                   22.
                         
                         
                              WIFE WITNESSES.
                              Mr. Johnson's bill [H. R. 112] to render wives competent
                                   witnesses in actions brought for damages done to them in person
                                   or character, was read the third time and passed--yeas 87, nays
                                   0.
                         
                         
                              JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.
                              Mr. STRANGE introduced a bill [H. R. 229] to provide for furnishing
                                   statutes to Justices of the Peace.
                              Leave was granted the Judiciary Committee and
                                   the Committee on Public Expenditures to sit
                                   during the sessions of the House.
                              On motion of Mr. JOHNSON, his bill [H. R. 124] in relation to the
                                   soldiers' monument, was referred back to the special
                                   committee on that subject.
                              On motion of Mr. BUTTERWORTH, the House adjourned till to-morrow
                                   morning at nine o'clock.
                         
                    
                    
                    
                         THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                         
                         THIRTEENTH VOLUME.
                         
                         INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
                         
                         IN SENATE.
                         
                              FRIDAY, December 13, 1872.
                         
                         The Senate met at ten o'clock, a, m.
                         The Secretary's minutes of yesterday's proceedings
                              were being read when--
                         On motion by Mr. THOMPSON the further reading thereof was dispensed
                              with.
                         
                              PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
                              The following papers were presented and referred to the appropriate
                                   committees:
                              By Mr. ARMSTRONG: From the Mayor and Council of Kokomo, the
                                   Superintendent of Public Instruction, and other residents of the
                                   town, praying that an erroneous assessment for school purposes
                                   madeby the school trustee may be legalized.
                              By Mr. NEFF: From over one thousand citizens of Randolph county,
                                   two petitions praying for the repeal of gravel and plank road
                                   laws, and the railroad assessment laws.

                                   keeping in repair the Wabash and Erie Canal through counties
                                   along the line thereof.
                              By Mr. HOUGH: On the subject of railroads, from citizens of Henry
                                   county, praying modification of county and township railroad
                                   act.
                              By Mr. DAGGY: A petition, which was referred, without reading,
                                   praying the enactment of a law to prevent reckless hunting.

                              REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                              Mr. BROWN, from the Judiciary Committee,
                                   returned the bill [S. 23] to authorize counties to appropriate
                                   money to keep in repair any canal running through said county,
                                   with a report recommending amendments.
                              He also returned from the same committee the bill [S. 103] to amend
                                   the Common School law, with a favorable recommendation.
                              He also returned from the same committee the bill [S. 98] to
                                   prevent carrying concealed weapons, with amendments.
                              He also returned the bill [S. 93] limiting the number of grand and
                                   petit jurors, recommending that it be indefinately postponed.
                              He also returned the bill [S. 42] to amend the act concerning
                                   promissory notes.
                              Also the bill [S. 67] amending, the 29th section of the
                                   Justices' Act, recommending its indefinite
                                   postponement.
                              These reports were severally concurred in.
                              Also the bill [S. 102] for the repeal of the valuation and
                                   appraisement laws of property taken on execution, recommending
                                   that it lie on the table.
                              
                              Mr. HUBBARD resisted concurrence in this report, citing reasons why
                                   some such bill as the one proposed should become the law of the
                                   land.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              Mr. BROWN, from the Judiciary Committee,
                                   returned the bill [S. 92] to amend section 16 of the real
                                   property act, recommending that it be indefinitely postponed.
                              Also the bill [S. 57] to repeal the act to prevent the breaking of
                                   a quorum of the General Assembly, recommending indefinite
                                   postponement.
                              Also, the bill [S. 60] to regulate interest on judgments, with a
                                   similar report--the House having passed a bill in almost the same
                                   language.
                              These reports were severally concurred in.
                              Also, the bill [S. 90] to amend section 24 of the descent and
                                   apportionment of estate act, with a report that it lie on the
                                   table.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              He also returned the bill [S. 18] to repeal the plank and gravel
                                   road acts of 1867 and 1859, recommending indefinite
                                   postponement.
                              Mr. GREGG advised careful consideration before voting upon this
                                   report.
                              On motion of Mr. BROWN, the report was laid on the table till
                                   Senator Steele shall appear in his seat.
                         
                         
                              DECEDENTS' ESTATES.
                              Mr. BROWN, from the Judiciary Committee,
                                   returned the bill [S. 46] to repeal section 41 of the will act,
                                   with a recommendation that it lie on the table.
                              Mr. NEFF would like an expression of the Senate on the merits of
                                   the bill. The law proposed to be repealed is pernicious in the
                                   settlement of estates, as it allows more than one contest. A
                                   single contest is all that should be allowed. Estates are
                                   sometimes almost frittered away in repeated contests over will.
                                   He believed this provision and others to prolong the settlement
                                   of estates, make a crying evil of the day.
                              Mr. BROWN hoped the Seriate would not be seduced by the cries of
                                   reform made by the Senator from Randolph [Mr. Neff ]. He argued
                                   against the passage of a bill such as is proposed to be laid on
                                   the table by the Judiciary Committee. The
                                   provision proposed to be repeated has nothing to do with the
                                   prolongation of the settlement of estates.
                              The report of the committee was then concurred in by consent.
                         
                         
                              MARRIED WOMEN.
                              Mr. BROWN on behalf of the Judiciary Committee,
                                   returned the resolution of inquiry as to the expediency of
                                   creating a law granting to married women the same rights in
                                   regard to holding property that are enjoyed by single women, with
                                   a recommendation that it lie on the table.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              Mr. BROWN, from the same committee, returned the bill [S. 91]
                                   concerning married women's contracts, to make her really
                                   liable.
                              This report was laid on the table.
                         
                         
                              BANKS.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS, from the Committee on Banks,
                                   returned the bill [S. 6] on taxation of bank stock, with a
                                   substitute recommended by the majority of the committee.
                              Mr. GREGG, from the minority of said committee, submitted the
                                   following report:
                              MR. PRESIDENT: The Committee
                                   on Bank and Banking on the part of the minority of said Committee
                                   beg leave to report that we have had under consideration Senate
                                   bill No. 4, entitled "A Bill to provide for the
                                   assessment and collection of taxes for municipal purpose on the
                                   shares of stock owners in banks and banking associations doing
                                   business in this State," and concur in this report:
                              That Senate Bill, No, 4, is an exact copy of House Bill No. 6,
                                   introduced into the House of Representatives of the 47th General
                                   Assembly of the State of Indiana, and referred by that body to
                                   the Committee on the Judiciary and by that
                                   Committee reported back with the unanimous recommendation that it
                                   pass. Afterwards, to wit, on the 9th day of February, 1871, said
                                   bill passed the House of Representatives, with the endorsement of
                                   85 yeas o 8 nays. The bill was received in the Senate on the 10th
                                   day of February, 1871, and failed to pass that body by reason of
                                   the abrupt termination of the Legislature.
                              The bill reported herewith is ample in all its provisions to carry
                                   out the object and purposes expressed in the title, the object of
                                   the bill is to tax the shares of National Banks for municipal
                                   purposes, at the City or Town where the bank is located, at the
                                   same rate that other personal property is taxed.
                              The bill reported by the majority of the Committee provides that
                                   shares in National Banks shall be taxed where the owners thereof
                                   reside respectively, and not at the City or Town where the bank
                                   is located, unless the owner of the stock resides in such City or
                                   Town, non-residents excepted.
                              At the time of the enactment of the General Tax laws of this State,
                                   State Banks were not subject to taxation for municipal purposes.
                                   It was provided however that the stock of merchants and
                                   manufacturers should be taxed where located.
                              Municipal taxation, rests upon the theory that the property that is
                                   situate in the City and protected by its government, should bear
                                   its proper share of the burthen of supporting such government. If
                                   the shares of banks are to be taxed where the owner resides in
                                   the country--they would have nothing to pay for municipal
                                   purposes, thougthe bank was located in the City. Thus property
                                   had not had the protection of City government.
                              Congress has long since given the powers to tax the total shares of
                                   capital Stock of National Banks.
                              The cities and towns of this State have long suffered for the want
                                   of necessary legislation upon this subject. It is, therefore,
                                   recommended that the bill herewith reported be passed.
                              RICHARD GREGG,
                              
                              HUGH DAUGHERTY.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved to lay the reports on the table for the
                                   present.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              
                              Mr.GREGG moved that these reports be made the special order for
                                   Wednesday next, at two o'clock.
                              Mr. PRESIDENT decided this motion out of order.
                              Mr. OLIVER, from the Committee on Public

                                   consent of the State to the sale of certain lots in Evansville to

                                   favorable report thereon.

                                   with the business in the regular order, as prescribed by the
                                   rules of the Senate.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS moved to lay the motion on the table.
                              This latter motion was rejected by yeas 17, nays 25.
                              The motion to reconsider was agreed to.
                              On motion by Mr. DWIGGINS the resolution was laid on the table.
                              On motion by Mr. MILLER the order of business was dispensed with,
                                   and bill [H. R. 49] creating the Twenty-second Judicial
                                   Circuit--Miami, Wabash and Huntington--was taken up and read the
                                   third time, and passed by yeas 35, nays 6.
                              Messrs. Bird, Dittemore, Dwiggins, Friedley of Scott, and Hough,
                                   explaining their votes.
                              On motion by Mr. GOODING, the order of business was suspended, and
                                   the bill [S. 135] defining what counties shall constitue the
                                   Thirtieth Judicial Circuit--the county of Vanderburg--was read
                                   the second time.
                              Mr. GOODING moved for the suspension of the constitutional rule
                                   that the bill may be passed to the final vote now.
                              Mr. CARNAHAN opposed the motion and the passage of the bill, being
                                   confident that the people there do not ask it.
                              Mr. GOODING claimed that in the entire Union there is not another
                                   city of the size of Evansyille but what has a judge exercising
                                   civil jurisdiction; and he was sure the bill was asking nothing
                                   but what is just and proper.
                              The motion to dispense with the constitutional restrictions was
                                   rejected. Yeas, 29; nays, 11--two-thirds not voting in the
                                   affirmative.
                              Mr. CARNAHAN moved to refer the bill to a special committee of
                                   three, with instructions to add Posey to Vanderburg.
                              Mr. GOODING moved to amend, by changing the reference to the
                                        Committee on the Judiciary.
                              Mr. CARNAHAN consented that it shall go to the Judiciary
                                        Committee.
                              On motion by Mr. BROWN, it was so referred, with instructions to
                                   inquire into the expediency of the passage of the bill.
                              On motion by Mr. DWIGGINS, the rules were still further suspended,
                                   and the bill [H. R. 32] to provide times for holding Common Pleas
                                   Courts in the Fifteenth Judicial District--Porter, Lake, Newton,
                                   Jasper and Starke--was read the second time.
                              On his further motion, the constitutional restriction was dispensed
                                   with by yeas 35, nays 14, the bill was read the third time, and
                                   passed by yeas 37, nays 0, with an amendment of title.
                              On motion by Mr. BROWN, the rules were still further suspended and
                                   the bill [S. 145] in relation to the number of employes in the
                                   House, was read by title and referred to the Commitiee
                                        on Expenditures.
                              On motion of Mr. BOWMAN [Mr. Dwiggins in the Chair], under a
                                   suspension of the rules, the bill [S. 118] to fix court terms in
                                   the Second Judicial Circuit was read the second time. It affects
                                   Scott, Jackson, Lawrence, Washington, Harrison, Clark, Orange and
                                   Floyd counties.
                              It was referred to a special committee, consisting of Messrs.
                                   Bowman, Friedley of Lawrence and Brown.
                              
                              On motion by Mr. CAVE, the bill [S. 24] under a suspension of the
                                   order of business, was taken up. It proposes to amend section 30
                                   of the Supervisor of Highways act of December 20, 1865.
                              It was read the second time, with clerical amendments proposed by
                                   the Committee on County and Township Business,
                                   which were concurred in, and the bill was ordered engrossed.
                         
                         
                              THE ASSEMBLY.
                              On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS, the order was suspended, and the bill
                                   [H. R. 119] in relation to the organization of the two Houses of
                                   the General Assembly, was read the second time.
                              On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS, the constitutional restriction was
                                   dispensed with by yeas 34, nays 1, and the bill was read the
                                   third time.
                              The vote on the passage of the bill discovering no quorum
                                   present--
                              On motion a call of the Senate was ordered, and being taken,
                                   thirty-two Senators answered to their names. Several other
                                   Senators appearing--
                              Further proceedings under the call were dispensed with.
                              The bill was then finally passed by yeas 38, nays 0, with an
                                   amendment of title.
                              Mr. TAYLOR, by leave, submitted a report from the
                                        Committee on Expenditures, returning the
                                   bill [S. 145] prescribing the number of employes of the two
                                   Houses of the General Assembly, with amendments.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              The bill was read the second time and ordered engrossed.
                              
                              On motion by Mr. HALL, the bill [S. 170] to establish a sanitarium,
                                   was read by title and referred to the Committee on
                                        Rights and Privileges.
                              Mr. BROWN moved for a dispensation of the constitutional
                                   restriction that the Senate Bill 145, relating to the employes of
                                   the General Assembly, be pressed to the final passage.
                              The motion was agreed to by yeas 39, nays 0.
                              Accordingly the bill [S. 145] in relating to the organization of
                                   the two Houses of the General Assembly, the officers thereof and
                                   the number of employes allowed each, was read the third time and
                                   passed by yeas 40, nays 0.
                         
                         
                              COUNTY SEATS.
                              On motion by Mr. BEESON, at the suggestion of Mr. Dittemore, the
                                   bill [S. 148] to provide for the relocation of county seats, was
                                   read by title under a dispensation of the constitutional
                                   restriction.
                              On motion by Mr. BEESON, it was referred to the Committee
                                        on the Judiciary.
                         
                         
                              TIPPECANOE BATTLE GROUND.
                              On motion by Mr. TAYLOR, the bill [S. 45] to provide for the
                                   permanent enclosure around the Tippecanoe battle ground, was read
                                   the second time, with committee amendments, which were agreed to,
                                   appropriating $25,000, etc.
                              Mr. BROWN moved that the constitutional restriction be dispensed
                                   with, and the bill pressed to third reading. He would vote with
                                   very great pleasure for this bill, which proposes to enclose that
                                   historic ground.
                              Mr. HOUGH believed $25,000 too large an appropriation, and believed
                                   a substantial enclosure could be built for one-twenty-fifth part
                                   of the sum named in the bill--he suggested a hedge fence.
                              Mr. BROWN desired a fence placed around that place having a
                                   permanent, and sightly, and at the same time, ornamental
                                   appearance.
                              Mr. TAYLOR spoke in favor of the appropriation.
                              Mr. SLEETH was willing to vote the estimated cost--viz: $24,100and
                                   he moved to so amend the bill--Mr Brown withdrawing his motion to
                                   allow this one.
                              Mr. ORR favored the motion--though it appropriated a large
                                   amount.
                              Mr. NEFF saw no comparison between the beauty of a hedge or iron
                                   fence, and without taking into consideration the cost, the former
                                   was his decided choice.
                              Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence (Mr. Dwiggins in the chair) desired the
                                   iron fence.
                              The amendment was adopted.
                              On motion the bill was made the special order for to-morrow at
                                   half-past ten o'clock.
                         
                         
                              CONGRESSIONAL APPORTIONMENT.
                              Mr. GOODING, from the Select Committee thereon returned the bill
                                   [S. 54] apportioning the State for Congressional purposes, with
                                   amendments.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              On motion, by Mr. GOODING, the rules were suspended and the bill
                                   read the second time.
                              The PRESIDENT announced Messrs. Gooding, Sleeth, and Armstrong as a
                                   committee authorized bv a resolution of yesterday to inquire into

                                   216] defining certain misdemeanors by prosecuting attorneys,
                                   etc., with the expression of opinion that the subject matter of
                                   the bill is already embodied in the statute.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY also returned Mr. Gifford's bill [H. R. 216]
                                   to legalize the acts, of guardians, under orders defective in not
                                   prescribing notice, etc., recommending its passage.
                              Mr. MILLER. I had intended to prepare a mfnority report here. The
                                   object is to provide, that where the land of the ward has been
                                   sold by the guardian since 1852, in cases where he failed to show
                                   that it would be for the benefit of the ward, and when he failed
                                   as to the notice, the act of the guardian shall be legalized.
                                   Now, I think that, under such circumstances, where the sale has
                                   been a bona fide transaction, it ought to be legalized. I move
                                   that the report be laid on the table.
                              The report was accordingly laid on the table.
                         
                         
                              VOID ASSESSMENTS OF 1869.
                              On motion by Mr. RICHARDSON, the order of business was suspended,
                                   and the House took up the consideration of his bill [H. R. 157]
                                   authorizing the refunding of taxes paid by certain counties in
                                   1869 and 1870, under erroneous and void assessment, on account of
                                   irregularities in the proceedings of the Board of Equalization,
                                   with the adverse report thereon by the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary; and he moved to refer the bill to the
                                        Committee on the Organization of Courts,
                                   with instructions to strike oat the first section.
                              Mr. OFFUTT recited the provisions of the bill, and stated that the
                                   county of Marion refused to pay the taxes so erroneously
                                   assessed, and was sustained by the Supreme Court. It was
                                   reasonable, therefore, that the counties which have paid their money so assessed and
                                   collected, should have it refunded to them. He reasoned at some
                                   length, and showed the law, that where taxes have been so
                                   collected the money shall be refunded. He concluded by expressing
                                   the desire to recommit the bill with instructions to amend by
                                   striking out the words, "out of any money in the
                                   Treasury not otherwise appropriated."
                              Mr. MILLER. This irregularity was on a technicality as to time or
                                   something of that sort, and because Marion county took advantage
                                   of this technical irregularity, that furnished no sufficient
                                   reason that other counties shall have the same advantage who do
                                   not apply to the courts. He moved ineffectually, that the bill be
                                   referred to the Committee on Ways and
                                   Means.
                              Mr. RICHARDSON'S motion prevailed, and the bill and
                                   instructions were referred to the Committee on the
                                        Organization of Courts of Justice.
                         
                         
                              REPORTS--CONGRESSIONAL APPORTIONMENT.
                              Mr. EDWARDS, of Lawrence, from the Committee on
                                        Elections, returned Mr. Hardesty's bill
                                   [H. R. 83] to divide the State into Congressional Districts, with
                                   amendments, which were concurred in, against a minorty report
                                   submitted by Mr. Isenhower, for indefinite postponement; and
                                   then--
                              On motion of Mr. GIVAN, it was ordered that the bill, as amended,
                                   lie on the table, and that 200 copies thereof be printed.
                              Mr. JOHNSON, from the Judiciary Committee,
                                   returned the bill [H. R. 215] to create the [blank] Judicial
                                   Circuit, and transfer the county of Union from the 26th to the
                                   4th Circuit, recommending that it be referred to the
                                        Committee on the Organization of
                                   Courts.
                              Which was concurred in.
                         
                         
                              CONTRACTS FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES.
                              He also returned Mr. Buskirk's bill [H. R. 20] concerning
                                   contracts wherein the obligor agrees to pay attorney's
                                   fees, etc., recommending its indefinite postponement.
                              Mr. BUSKIRK recited the provisions of the bill. All such contracts
                                   hereafter made shall be void; such existing contracts shall be
                                   sued within five days of maturity; if the judgment, or any part
                                   it, so recovered, be paid to the attorney representing the
                                   plaintiff the defendant shall be liable to plaintiff for it. It
                                   has been drawn in compliance with the almost unanimous desire of
                                   the people of my county, and I hope the report will be voted
                                   down. He demanded the yeas and nays on the question, which were
                                   taken, and resulted--yeas 41, nays 23.
                              So the report was concurred in, and the bill indefinitely
                                   postponed.
                              Mr. JOHNSON also returned Mr. Wesner's bill [H. R. 150] to
                                   repeal section 2 of the act of Decembr 2,1855, defining certain
                                   misdemeanors, with the recommendation that it be indefinitely
                                   postponed.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY, from the Committee ou Organization of Courts, reported
                                   back Mr. Riggs' bill [H. R. 223], creating the Thirtieth
                                   Judicial Circuit of Vanderburg county, with the recommendation
                                   that it pass.
                              It was ordered to be engrossed.
                              Mr. OFFUTT, from the same committee, reported back Mr. Wilson of
                                   Ripley's bill [H. R. 218] to amend section 208 of the
                                   practice act, recommending its passage.
                              It was ordered to be engrossed.
                              Mr. GLASGOW returned Mr. Edwards of Lawrence's bill [H. R.
                                   206] to amend the Supreme Court act of 1852, with a motion that
                                   it be laid on the table, which was concurred in.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY returned Mr. Glasgow's bill [H. R. 194] to
                                   repeal section 1 of the descents act of May 14, 1852,
                                   recommending indefinite postponement, which was concurred in.
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE, from the committee on Banks,
                                   returned Mr. Riggs' bill [H. R. 198] to amend the
                                   savings bank act with amendment heretofore directed by the
                                   House--(to make uniform the time of declaring dividends)--which
                                   was adopted, and so it was ordered to be engrossed, and on the
                                   question of final passage it failed--yeas 44, nays 30, for want
                                   of the constitutional majority.
                              Mr. LENFESTY presented the petition of Overman and others of Grant
                                   county, for a good liquor law.
                              Mr. HATCH, from the Committee on Affairs of the City of
                                        Indianapolis, returned Mr. Glazebrook's
                                   bill [H. R. 219] to regulate the sale of drugs, with clerical
                                   amendments, which were adopted.
                              On motion of Mr, MILLER, the emergency clause was stricken out, and
                                   the bill was ordered to be engrossed.
                              Mr. GIFFORD, from the Committee on Cities and
                                        Towns, returned Mr. King's bill [H. R.
                                   100] in relation to the widening and vacation of streets,
                                   recommending that 200 copies be printed.
                              Which was concurred in.
                              He also returned Mr. King's bill [H. R. 99] authorizing
                                   cities and towns of 10,000 and more inhabitants to borrow money,
                                   with an amendment, at two per cent.
                              
                              Mr. MILLER submitted a minority report, recommending its indefinite
                                   postponement on account of its loose provisions.
                              The minority report was concurred in, and the bill postponed
                                   accordingly.
                              Mr. REEVES, from the Committee on Roads,
                                   returned Mr. Brett's bill [H. R 192] to amend the
                                   Supervisors' act, recommending its indefinite
                                   postponement. He also submitted an adverse report as to Mr.
                                   Gregory's bill [H. R. 145] to amend sections 17 and 20
                                   of the Coroners' act; also an adverse report on the
                                   resolutions for abolishing the office of District Supervisors of
                                   roads, and substituting township Superviors.
                              Which reports were concurred in.
                              Mr. BILLINGSLEY, from the Committee on Printing,
                                   asked and obtained further time to report on the matter of Mr.
                                   Shirley's bills in relation to the Public printing.
                              Mr. KING, from the Committee on Railroads,
                                   returned Mr. Edward of Lawrence's bill [H. R. 96] to
                                   repeal the act to authorize aid to the construction of railroads
                                   by counties and townships taking stock therein, reporting for its
                                   passage, and for a motion that the consideration of the bill be
                                   made the special order for Monday at two o'clock p.
                                   m.
                              Mr. BRANHAM indicated the intention of a portion of the committee
                                   to submit a minority report.
                              Mr. BAKER submitted a motion to make the matter a special order for
                                   Wednesday.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. The minority can make their report by Monday
                                   morning.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. I presume the House does not wish to hasten this
                                   matter, but to a portion of the people of Indiana this is an
                                   important matter, and delays are dangerous to them. Take my own
                                   county, for example. We have heavy taxes to pay and there is now
                                   an order for an election to impose a railroad construction tax
                                   under the act here sought to be repealed. And if this bill is
                                   voted down or too long delayed, they may possibly be compelled to
                                   pay a tax which perhaps most of the people do not desire to pay.
                                   Therefore I should prefer Monday to Wednesday.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. I hope the House will not take hold of this matter in
                                   a great hurry. If the law is not repealed at once, it can work no
                                   great hardship. The law is carefully guarded, and if the majority
                                   are not competent to decide such a question as it contemplates, I
                                   don't know who is. This law goes upon a principle that
                                   lies at the foundation of the government. It says a majority of
                                   the legal voters shall have the right to assess themselves. I
                                   acquiesce in the motion to make the bill the special order for
                                   Monday.
                              The bill was made the special order for Monday, 2 o'clock,
                                   p. m.
                              Mr. BAXTER, from the Committee on Reformatory
                                        Institutions, returned his bill [H. R. 210] to
                                   amend section 20 of the act to establish a female prison and
                                   reformatory institution for girls and women. Also, his bill [H.
                                   R. 215] supplementary to the act to establish a reformatory
                                   institution for girls and women, with an amendment filling the
                                   blank for completing the building and fencing the grounds, with
                                   the words, "fifty thousand dollars." The
                                   amendment was adopted, and the bills were ordered to the
                                   engrossment. He also returned Mr. Butts' bill defining
                                   it as a misdemeanor to keep a house of ill-fame, or to rent a
                                   house, etc., for such purpose, prescribing penalties, rules of
                                   evidence, etc., [first offense, penalty, fine and imprisonment
                                   $10 to $1,500, imprisonment not exceeding three years; second
                                   offense, penalty, fine from $10 to $2,000 with imprisonment,]
                                   with a recommendation that it pass. It was ordered to the
                                   engrossment.
                         
                         
                              THIRD JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.
                              Mr. PEED, from the Special Committee thereon, returned his bill.
                                   [H. R. 21] changing the time of holding Court in the Third
                                   Judicial Circuit, with an amendment which was adopted, and on his
                                   motion (the restrictions being suspended for the purpose) the
                                   bill was advanced and finally passed the House--yeas 78; nays
                                   0.
                         
                         
                              HEATING AND VENTILATION OF THE HALL.
                              Mr. MELLETT, from the special committee to inquire into the matter
                                   of heating and ventilating the hall, reported that the flues to
                                   conduct the hot air into that hall have not been cleaned for
                                   years; that the hot air is supplied from the vitiated air of the
                                   cellar, and that the means of escape of foul air from the roomare
                                   inadequate. They recommend that the new pipes be constructed to
                                   conduct pure air to the heating furnace, and that four new flues
                                   be constructed for the escape of foul are from the hall. They say
                                   the improvements can be constructed for $400, and recommend that
                                   it be attended to at once. The report was concurred in.
                         
                         
                              STATES' SOLDIERS--CIRCLE PARK
                                   MONUMENT.
                              Mr. KIMBALL, from the majority of the Special Committee thereon,
                                   returned Mr. Johnson's bill [H. R. 124] to provide a
                                   State monument in the city of Indianapolis, to the memory of
                                   soldiers and seamen in the
                                   late wars, with an amendment reducing the appropriation to
                                   $75,000, and providing that not more than one-third of the sum
                                   shall be expended in one year, and provided, further, that no
                                   part of the appropriation shall be used until there shall have
                                   been subscribed for the same purpose the sum of $35,000 and
                                   one-third of the same collected.
                              Mr. OFFUTT submitted a minority report, recommending a substitute
                                   with this title: "A bill for an act to appropriate
                                   $100,000 to certain of the widows and orphans of deceased
                                   soldiers." And the body of the bill makes said
                                   appropriation and provides for its distribution among such of the
                                   widows and orphans of deceased Indiana soldiers as are in actual
                                   need.
                              Mr. WALKER. This minority report is forbidden by the 19th rule,
                                   which says: "No motion shall be entertained seeking to
                                   change the character of the original proposition."
                              The SPEAKER. The chair thinks such a ruling might be arbitrary
                                   here.
                              Mr. OFFUTT, It is true that the professed object of the bill is the
                                   erection of a State Monument in this city to the memory of the
                                   soldiers of the war of 1812, the Mexican and the late wars. I did
                                   not present this report for the purpose of any reflection on
                                   those brave men who defended their country in her time of need.
                                   There is no man in the House who would go further or do more to
                                   perpetuate their memory than I. But it seems to me that to erect
                                   a monument in the city of Indianapolis in the manner proposed in
                                   the original bill would be no suitable memorial of the dead, and
                                   no lasting benefit of the living. And I think I am right in
                                   assuming that, if any appropriation of a hundred thousand dollars
                                   should be given to Marion county for the purpose of erecting this
                                   monument, every other county in the State might, with a similar
                                   propriety, ask for a similar appropriation for a similar monument
                                   in their several cities, But further: it has been said, I
                                   believe, in the Indianapolis Journal, that the
                                   erection of the proposed monument would not satisfy of this
                                   bill--that they want now to erect a fountain onthe same site the
                                   public expense. And I think I am authorized to say, that, if this
                                   bill should be carried, at the next session there will be an
                                   effort made to change the character of the original design, and
                                   erect a fountain. It has been already charged that this is an
                                   extravagant Legislature, and that it will expend more money than
                                   any former Legislature. And, sir, the people will not at this
                                   time, in my judgment, appreciate the expenditure of $100,000 for
                                   this purpose; and it seems to me that this bill might with
                                   propriety be indefinitely postponed. There are other public needs
                                   more pressing--the provisions for the benevolent institutions and
                                   the prisons of the State, the demands for public education, for a
                                   new State House, etc. The taxes are oppressive, and I do not
                                   believe an appropriation of this character would be sanctioned by
                                   the people. I know the delicacy that belongs to the discussion of
                                   this proposition--that, perhaps, the motives of the opposition
                                   may be called in question. I confess that I hesitated before
                                   coining to the conclusion to oppose it, but I came to that
                                   conclusion because of my conviction that the people will not
                                   justify it. I know it is a favorite measure with the gentleman
                                   from Marion, and regret the necessity--I say not the danger--of
                                   opposing him. Whilst this monument might be quite an ornament to
                                   the city; whilst it might enhance the value of property round the
                                   Governor's Circle, still it will not advance the
                                   interests of the taxpayers. I am opposed to this monument for the
                                   memory of our fallen heroes for these special reasons. Whilst I
                                   would be glad I to do what we may to relieve the necessitous poor
                                   amongst their surviving widows and orphans, and I believe that if
                                   the dead could be heard from their graves they would say that if
                                   this money must be appropriated, let it go to their widows and
                                   orphans.
                              Mr. CLARK opposed the bill, by considering the paramount claims for
                                   the schools on the part of the 127,000 in the State who can
                                   neither read nor write, and on the part of the hundreds of boys
                                   in Carroll county that need a reformatory school. The soldiers of
                                   the State already have a monument that is far more enduring than
                                   marble or granite.
                              Mr. FURNAS added this: That a good many counties have already
                                   erected their local soldiers' monuments, taxing
                                   themselves heavily for the purpose; and if this bill passes they
                                   will be taxed over again for the State monument--and he felt
                                   cautious because he knew we would have use enough for the public
                                   money without giving anything for mere ornamentation.
                              Mr. BRANHAM, satisfied that this is not an opportune moment for the
                                   bill, indicated a motion to lay the subject on the table.
                              Mr. JOHNSON would say a word in answer to the gentlemen from
                                   Hendricks (Mr. Furnas) and the gentlemen from Hancock (Mr.
                                   Offutt). The amount of the tax for this monument would be exceedingly small to the
                                   individual when distributed all over the State, By a nett
                                   calculation, it will cost each inhabitant of the State one and
                                   one-third cent per year for three years. In answer to the
                                   intimation that the disabled soldiers are not taken care of, it
                                   is only necessary to say that the general and State governments
                                   have made provision for them. In answer to the report submitted
                                   by the minority to divert this money for the benefit of the
                                   widows and orphans of the soldiers, it is hardly necessary to say
                                   that, when we go over the State and look at their vast number, it
                                   would suffice but for a very exceedingly small morsel for each
                                   one. Sir, I know something of the minds of the widows of our
                                   soldiers, and I know something of the sentiments with regard to
                                   those dead soldiers in the minds of the people. And if you were
                                   to divide these seventy-five thousand dollars among those widows
                                   and orphans they will gladly enough give it all back for this
                                   monument, because what you would give them in the way of a
                                   support would soon be gone; its benefits would be transient; and
                                   because the State would apply it to the erection of an
                                   imperishable shaft in the commercial center of the State that
                                   would keep the memory of their dead forever green in the hearts
                                   of all. Mr. J. referred to appropriate site for the proposed
                                   monument in the center of Circle Park, to face the new State
                                   House down Market street, to the west--the two grandest monuments
                                   of the State fronting each other--and both in sight of Crown
                                   Hill, where so many of the soldiers have been laid away in their
                                   sleep. God bless the sleeping soldiers of Indiana! Generations
                                   will bless the Legislature for this appropriation.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY objected to what seemed to be an intention to press
                                   such a question as this to the vote in its present shape. He
                                   would honor the soldiers, but he would not do so by placing their
                                   monument where it would most of all benefit the adjacent property
                                   owners. He would have it erected at Crown Hill. The reasoning was
                                   sound and unanswerable against the monument at this time; bnt if
                                   we are to have it, I want it where it will be seen by those
                                   concerned for the just memory of the soldiers--where we meet
                                   every year to strew their graves with flowers. I am not going on
                                   the record as indifferent to the memory of the fallen soldiers of
                                   Indiana; but I am opposed to putting such a monument where
                                   gentlemen want it, a place comparatively obscure and unknown
                                   except to the owners of property adjacent.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley. The gentlemen would place it three miles
                                   from the city--and if that is not obscureness I don't
                                   know what is. It is our proposition to place this monument in the
                                   centre of the great railroad city. I believe that we could place
                                   it in no other position where it would receive so much
                                   consideration--so many visitors. It was well observed by the
                                   gentleman from Marion (Mr. Johnson) that it should be here where
                                   the soldiers gathered during the war, and where so many of them
                                   sleep. I believe the bill is so well guarded, that every cent of
                                   the money will be given to the construction of the monument
                                   itself. It has been sixty years since we had the last war here
                                   with the Indians and with Great Britian; twenty-five years since
                                   the war which fixed our title to the great Pacific Coast, and
                                   twelve years since the great war of the rebellion, and are we to
                                   be told that the people of Indiana are too poor for this work?
                                   Then we are a poverty stricken people indeed. I hope the House
                                   will refuse to lay this subject on the table, for I feel that
                                   such a vote would be offering an insult--an indignity--to the
                                   memory of the fallen sons of Indiana.
                              Mr. SMITH. My county is taxing herself to build a
                                   soldiers' monument equal to that proposed by this bill;
                                   and it woudl be unjust to call on them to aid in the erection of
                                   another.
                              Mr. JOHNSON. We are to have $35,000 subscribed and paid into the
                                   fund for the monument in the Circle. Gentleman say we are
                                   specially benefitting private parties. I simply tell them that we
                                   are getting private subscriptions beyond anything that can be
                                   estimated as private benefits.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. What I wish to say is this: That the county of Marion
                                   does not ask any other county to do what she does not propose to
                                   do herself. It is true that some counties have erected their
                                   soldiers' monuments. They are to the memory of their
                                   fallen in the late war; but this is to the memory of those who
                                   saved the Western States from the invasions of the British and
                                   Indians as well as those who gave their lives to their
                                   country's renown in the Mexican war and the war of the
                                   rebellion. It has been well remearked by my colleague here (Mr.
                                   Johnson) that the widows and orphans of these soldiers would most
                                   readily contribute their days' wages--yes, their
                                   months' wages, to a monument to the memory of their dead
                                   husbands and fathers. Now, Mr. Speaker, without delaying this
                                   matter  further, I want this
                                   distinctly kept in mind, that it is not Marion county that is
                                   asking for this monument. It is the State of Indiana; and it is
                                   wanted here, where men coming together into their commercial
                                   center can look upon a work erected by herself to immortalize the
                                   memory of her soldiers. If the $75,000 be given by the State, we
                                   will raise the $35,000, and erect this monument; we will not
                                   spend a dollar foolishly.
                              Mr. RENO considered that we have outgrown the age of monuments.
                                   This monument would never tell us even the names of those grave
                                   to whose memory it is proposed to be erected. Better educate the
                                   people with our money.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. If any man has a right to speak in this matter, he
                                   has. Three out of four--his sons--sleep in soldiers'
                                   graves--laid down their lives for their country. And when you
                                   talk about monuments over these graves, or anywhere else, you
                                   mistake the spirit of the age. The memory of those who defended
                                   these States against British power; the men who carried our flag
                                   victoriously over the plains of Mexico; and the glorious men who
                                   carried our flag into the Southern States, and gave their bodies
                                   for a rampart for the power that crushed the rebellion, have
                                   erected in your hearts a monument that is not to be compared with
                                   a monument of stone. It was for the purpose of not compelling men
                                   to take position on this question that he moved to lay it on the
                                   table, and would do so again. Bills for the appropriation of
                                   about half a million have been passed; and a gentleman here says
                                   $400,000 will be necessary; and there will be bills offered for
                                   more. So that the Treasury will not furnish enough for the
                                   present requirements of the State.
                              Mr. WOODWARD did not believe that there is a man on this floor
                                   belonging to either party who is not a friend of the soldier and
                                   careful of his memory; but the he derived from this appropriation
                                   of the State's money were so far outweighed by the
                                   benefits it might confer in other directions, that he would not
                                   vote to do anything for a monument. The soldiers' memory
                                   can never be obliterated; and if we can do anything let it be to
                                   take care of their widows and orphans.
                              Mr. BRANHAM now moved to lay the subject on the table, the vote
                                   resulting--yeas 54, nays 30--as follows:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             YEAS--Messrs. Anderson, Baker,
                                                  Baxter, Blocher, Bowser, Branham, Broadus,

                                                  Jones, Lenfesty, Martin, McConnell, McKinney,
                                                  Mellett, Miller, North, Offutt, Pfrimmer, Reno,

                                                  Spence, Troutman, Tulley, Whitworth, Wilson, of
                                                  Blackford, Woodard and Winn--54.
                                             NAYS--Billingsly, Buskirk,
                                                  Cauthorn, Cobb, Cowgill, Edwards, of Lawrence,
                                                  Ellsworth, Eward, Gifford, Glasgow, Gronendyke,
                                                  Hatch, Johnson, Kimball, King, Kirkpatrick, Lent,
                                                  Peed, Prentiss, Reeves, Riggs, Shirley, Thayer,
                                                  Tingley, Walker, Wesner, Willard, Woollen, and the
                                                  Speaker--30.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              So the matter was laid on the table.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY offered a resolution reciting that whereas it is
                                   understood the Committee on Public Printing
                                   had been prepared to report his bills for the abolition of the
                                   office of State Printer at the morning session, therefore the
                                   committee be instructed to report both bills [H. R. 9 and 31] on
                                   Monday morning.
                              Mr. KING moved to lay the resolution on the table.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY demanded the yeas and nays.
                              The House then took a recess till two o'clock p.m.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The House was called to order by the Speaker, at two p. m.
                              The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Auditor
                                   of State, transmitting advance sheets of that part of his report
                                   relating to insurance.
                         
                         
                              THE CALENDAR.
                              The bill [S. 3] to amend the act relating to the organization of
                                   voluntary associations, was read the first time and referred to
                                   the Committee on Corporations.
                         
                         
                              COUNTY AND TOWNSHIP R. R. STOCK.
                              The bill [S. 5], requiring railroad companies to issue stock to the
                                   tax payers of counties and towns where they have subscribed, and
                                   where they have paid for the same; and, where the same is
                                   unclaimed, to issue the certificates to the common school fund,
                                   was read the first time.
                              Mr. WOODARD moved to suspend the rules, so that the bill might be
                                   put upon its passage: and the rules were suspended
                                   accordingly.
                              Some debate ensued as to the merits of the bill, Messrs. PEED and
                                   WOODARD supporting the bill, and Mr. SHIRLEY favoring the
                                   reference of the bill to a committee in order that it might be
                                   examined with a view to securing the benefit of such stock
                                   certificates to the party securing them, and as to determining
                                   whether such holder of stock certificate is liable as a
                                   stockholder; and Mr. WOOLLEN contending that the law would work a
                                   hardship and injustice to the companies, inasmuch as not one tax payer in ten would
                                   be entitled to receive more than a fraction of one share of
                                   stock, and its distribution in such small sums would involve
                                   interminable labor in declaring dividends.
                              Mr. LENFESTY moved to refer to the Judiciary
                                        Committee.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                         
                         
                              COAL MINING REGULATIONS.
                              Mr. WILSON, from the Committee on the Judiciary
                                   (having obtained unanimous consent), returned Mr.
                                   Clifford's bill [H. R. 83] providing for the health and
                                   safety of persons employed in the coal mines of the State, with
                                   amendments by way of substitute, viz.: A bill [H. R. 230] with
                                   similar title.
                              The report was concurred in, and the bill was read the first
                                   time.
                              On motion of Mr. WALKER (the constitutional restriction having been
                                   suspended for the purpose), the substituted bill was read the
                                   second time by title, laid on the table, and 200 copies thereof
                                   were ordered to be printed.
                         
                         
                              THE CALENDAR.
                              The SPEAKER returned to the consideration of propositions in the
                                   calendar.
                              The bill [S. 6] concerning the transportation of freights and
                                   passengers over railroads in this State, repealing and
                                   prescribing penalties, was read and referred to the
                                        Committee on the Judiciary.

                                   March 14, 1867, was read the first time, and referred to the
                                        Committee on Cities and Towns.
                         
                         
                              TWENTY-THIRD COMMON PLEAS DISTRICT.
                              The bill [S. 68] to amend the second section of the act creating
                                   the Twenty-third Common Pleas District, of March, 1867, was read
                                   the first time.
                              On motion of Mr. ODLE, there was a suspension of the constitutional
                                   restriction, and the bill was advanced and finally passed the
                                   House without amendment--yeas 80, nays 0.
                              The bill [S. 88] to authorize and encourage the construction of
                                   levees, dykes, drains and ditches, and providing for the
                                   organization of associations for such purposes, prescribing their
                                   powers and duties in the assessments of damages, etc., was taken
                                   up and read the first time.
                              On motion of Mr. WOOD, it was laid on the table, and 200 copies
                                   thereof were ordered to be printed.
                              The bill [S. 124] to create the Twenty-sixth Judicial District was
                                   read the first time.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY moved to refer to the Committee on the
                                        Organization of Courts.
                              A long debate ensued on the merits of bill, participated in by
                                   Messrs. SHIRLEY, EDWARDS of Lawrence, WOOLLEN, COWGILL and
                                   WOODARD, till--
                              Mr. CAUTHORN moved to lay the bill upon the table.
                              It was agreed to.
                         
                         
                              SIXTH COMMON PLEAS DISTRICT.
                              The SPEAKER next announced the consideration of Mr.
                                   Broadus' bill [H. R 172] to fix the time of holding
                                   Common Pleas in the Sixth Judicial District, embracing the
                                   counties of Franklin, Union, Fayette and Wayne--the question
                                   being on the third reading.
                              Mr. BROADUS explained, and the bill passed the final reading in the
                                   House--yeas 70, nays 3.
                         
                         
                              COUNTY AND TOWNSHIP RAILROAD AID.
                              Mr. WYNN asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill [H. R. 231]
                                   to amend sections 16 and 18 of the act to authorize aid to
                                   railroads, by counties and townships taking stock therein, and
                                   making donations thereto, approved May 12, 1869. He explained
                                   that it was to provide against the law which after a certain
                                   amount of work is done, requires the Commissioners to pay over
                                   the local subscription to a railroad company, whose road may
                                   never be built. Another provision enables Commissioners to
                                   postpone the collection of taxes, where the railroad company
                                   fails to begin their work within one year. It provides, further,
                                   that where the railroad has not been commenced at the time of the
                                   collection of the taxes, the Commissioners may withhold the
                                   payment; and the next provision is that the money so collected
                                   shall go into the school fund of the county in which such taxes
                                   were raised. He moved to suspend the restrictions for the
                                   immediate passage of the bill.
                              Messrs. MELLETT and RICHARDSON saw no occasion demanding a
                                   suspension of the restrictions. Better repeal the statute.
                              Mr. WYNN. It simply provides, that where the taxes have been
                                   assessed, and the work has not been done, the County
                                   Commmissioners may restrain the collection of taxes. It does not
                                   suspend the taxes at all. If after the 25th of December the
                                   Railroad Company shall come up and go to work, the taxes will be
                                   collectable again the next year. It is a proposition directly in
                                   the interests of the people.
                              Mr. PEED. I move that, the bill be referred to the Commlttee on
                                   Railroads.
                              Mr. COWGILL. I hope the bill will be referred to that Committee.
                                   The 15th sec- tion of this
                                   law of 1869 forbids the payment of tax money of this kind until
                                   fifty per cent. of the road work shall have been done. I think
                                   the law we have already is sufficiently guarded. Still I might
                                   not find anything objectionable in this bill.
                              The SPEAKER. On the first reading of a bill it is not in order to
                                   amend--nothing, except the motion to reject.
                              The bill was referred to the Committee on
                                        RaiIroads.
                         
                         
                              APPORTIONMENT.
                              Mr. MELLETT obtained unanimous consent to introduce a bill [H. R.
                                   232] to fix the number of Senators and Representatives of the
                                   General Assembly of the State, and apportion the same among the
                                   several counties.
                              Mr. KELLER moved ineffectually to lay it on the table; and the bill
                                   was then referred to the Committee on
                                        Elections.
                         
                         
                              COURT TERMS AND TRIALS.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill [H. R.
                                   234] regulating the terms of courts, the time of forming issues
                                   for tral in the civil and criminal courts, and prescribing the
                                   power of the judges therein. (It empowers the judges to fix the
                                   terms of the courts and to docket the cases for trial in all
                                   civil and criminal courts, having regard to the population and
                                   business of each district, and to the provision that there shall
                                   not be less than two terms of the Circuit Court and three terms
                                   of the Common Pleas Court held annually in each county of the
                                   State.)
                              It was referred to the Committee on the organization of
                                        Courts.
                              The SPEAKER announced the consideration of the Senate amendment to
                                   Mr. Cogwill's 22d Circuit Court bill [H. R. 49], [which
                                   provides a clause of emergency], and it was taken np and
                                   concurred in.
                              On motion of Mr. WOOLLEN, his public funds depository bill [H. R.
                                   24] was taken from the table and referred to the
                                        Committee on the Judiciary.
                              Mr. WOODARD submitted a preamble and resolution reciting the
                                   recommendation of the late Secretary of State, for a
                                   reorganization of that office, and the fact that the General
                                   Assembly has recently increased the duties of that office, and
                                   resolving for the appointment of a special committee of three
                                   members of the House to act alone, or with a similar committee on
                                   the part of the Senate, to investigate the conditions and the
                                   needs of the office of the Secretary of State; and report by bill
                                   or otherwise.
                              It was adopted.
                              The House then adjourned.

                              SATURDAY, December 14, 1872.
                         
                         The Senate met pursuant to adjournment, President Friedley in the
                              Chair.
                         On motion, the reading of the journal was dispensed with.
                         
                              PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
                              Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN presented a paper from taxpayers of Allen county,
                                   remonstrating against the passage of a bill now on the Senate
                                   files authorizing county boards to appropriate money for keeping
                                   in repair canals running through or along the lines thereof.
                              Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN said this remonttrance was signed by some twelve
                                   hundred and fifty-five taxpayers, and in a letter I am informed
                                   that there is yet another being circulated having already on it
                                   some eight hundred signatures more. I would say, continued Mr.
                                   S., that I do not fully agree with the contents of the
                                   remonstrance, but as it has been sent to me I could not refuse to
                                   present it to the Senate. I hope the bill referred to will be
                                   made in such a shape that I can vote for it. As the
                                        Committee on the Judiciary has already
                                   reported the bill back, I move that the remonstrance be placed on
                                   the files and taken into consideration when the matter comes
                                   before the Senate.
                              Mr. BIRD replied that the memorial was from a gentleman of our
                                   county who previous to the canal being built had a dam and mill
                                   on the river. Since the building of this canal, in times of low
                                   water, his mill has no water, because the canal consumes it all.
                                   This one man, in consequence of his personal interest, has gotten
                                   up this petition. Besides this memorialist and the few whom he
                                   could influence, the citizens of Allen county were earnestly in
                                   favor of the bill. He moved to refer the bill to the Judiciary
                                   Committee.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                         
                         
                              CONGRESSIONAL APPORTIONMENT.
                              The Congressional apportionment bill [S. 54] being the unfinished
                                   business, Mr. GLESSNER moved that the bill be printed.
                              On motion by Mr. BROWN, this motion was laid on the table. Yeas,
                                   22; nays, 14.
                              On motion of Mr. TAYLOR, the message from the House announcing the
                                   passage of the bill [S. 5] in regard to the distribution of
                                   railroad stock among taxpayers, with an amendment was taken up,
                                   and the amendment was concurred in.
                              On Motion of Mr. WILLIAMS, the bill [H. R. 2] to fix the time of
                                   holding courts in the Third Judicial Circuit was read the first
                                   time.
                              On motion of Mr. BROWN, the bill [H. R. 163] to provide for a
                                   uniform assessment of property, etc., was taken up, read the
                                   first and second time by title only, and referred to the
                                        Committee on Finanace.
                         
                         
                              THE TIPPECANOE BATTLE GROUND.
                              The PRESIDENT announced the special order of business, being the
                                   bill [S. 45] to provide for a permanent enclosure around the
                                   Tippecanoe Battle Ground, the same being on its first
                                   reading.
                              
                              Mr. NEFF moved to amend the first section by striking out $24,000
                                   and inserting in lieu $14,000.
                              The PRESIDENT decided the amendment out of order, the Senate having
                                   filled the blank last evening.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE moved to reconsider the vote of last night, by which
                                   the blank was filled.
                              On motion of Mr. DWIGGINS, the motion to reconsider was laid on the
                                   table.
                              On motion by Mr. BROWN, the bill was considered as engrossed, and
                                   read the third time.
                              Mr. NEFF said he was friendly to the project sought to be
                                   accomplished by the bill, but believed the amount of the
                                   appropriation was too large. He and another Senator this morning
                                   visited the same manufacturer from whom the engineer on whose
                                   estimate the figures in the bill are based claims to have
                                   obtained his data, and found that the best fence he had could be
                                   furnished for $4 50 a foot, while the estimated cost according to
                                   the bill is $7 27 per foot. If the fence could be obtained for
                                   $14,000, he did not see the necessity nor the propriety of
                                   appropriating $24,000, and should therefore vote against the
                                   bill.
                              Mr. GREGG said he should vote for the appropriation for two
                                   reasons--first, because he believed the State could do no more
                                   proper and graceful thing than to suitably care for the ground in
                                   which the bones of our heroic dead rest, and second, because he
                                   hoped it would stimulate the State of Ohio to make suitable
                                   provision for the care of the tomb of the hero of Tippecanoe at
                                   North Bend.
                              Mr. DAGGY said the bill, by its very terms, provides not only for
                                   the inclosing of that ground, but that the surplus shall be
                                   applied to another purpose, another job to be set up for the
                                   State to pay for hereafter. He was not in favor of indirection of
                                   that kind. If they want a monument, and want the State to pay for
                                   it, let them put it in the bill in so many words, so that we may
                                   know what we are voting for. Another thing. We are told that Mr.
                                   E. M. Talbott says that this fence would cost so much. Who is Mr.
                                   Talbott? What interest has he in it? What per cent. does he get
                                   out of that appropriation.
                              A Senator--He gets none; no more than you do.
                              Mr. DAGGY--Did not doubt the gentlemen composing the committee
                                   reported properly and failry so far as their investigations went,
                                   but how far have they investigated? He thought a smaller
                                   appropriation, or even a larger appropriation, with a
                                   recommendation that its expenditure be left discretionary with
                                   the gentlemen who shall have the fence built would be proper and
                                   right. But when they come here and say, There is $25,000 to
                                   provide for a particular purpose, conceding that it is more than
                                   enough, the surplus to be used, after fat jobs are taken out of
                                   it, for a certain other purpose, he must object. He should not
                                   vote for the bill, because he did not think it was a safe bill,
                                   but as wasteful and extravagant. Whenever they present a bill for
                                   properly fencing this ground, and that alone, he would favor
                                   it.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS thought it very remarkable that Senators should be so
                                   very economical on this occasion, and also that they should
                                   insist that there was a job in this bill. If there was any job in
                                   it as the Senator charged, it was for the benefit of the
                                   Governor, the Secretary, Auditor and Treasurer of State. The bill
                                   simply authorizes these officers to properly inclose the battle
                                   ground and to draw upon the State Treasury to the amount of
                                   $24,100 for that purpose, if necessary. If it can be done for
                                   $14,000, they are bound to do it for $14,000. If it can be done
                                   for $10,000, they are bound to do it for $10,000. He thought
                                   those gentlemen could be trusted to administer the fund honestly
                                   and prudently.
                              Mr. HARNEY recollected that in the years 1849-50 he was a member of
                                   a legislative committee which reported in favor fencing this
                                   battle ground. A wooden fence was built around it, but fire came
                                   and burned up a great portion of it. Objections can always be
                                   raised where money is to be appropriated. You can not make it
                                   beyond peradventure that means will not be misappropriated, but
                                   from his knowledge of the people of Tippecanoe county, he did not
                                   believe they would suffer anything of the kind to be
                                   perpetrated.
                              Mr HOUGH did not wish to make any factious opposition to this
                                   measure, but thought the grounds could be inclosed in a much
                                   cheaper manner than proposed in the bill and as substantial. Many
                                   Senators insist that it shall be an iron fence, and he stood
                                   ready to vote for any bill that is fair to the taxpayers. But he
                                   opposed this bill because he believed a fence such as is
                                   contemplated can be made for $10,000 less than the sum named in
                                   the bill.
                              On motion by Mr. TAYLOR, at the suggestion of several Senators, the
                                   section providing for the expenditure of he surplus funds in the
                                   erection of a monument on
                                   the battle ground, was stricken out by unanimous consent.
                              Mr. SCOTT demanded the previous question
                              The Senate seconded the demand, and under its operations the bill
                                   passed the Senate, Yeas, 28; nays, 0.
                              Pending the roll-call, Mr. BEESON, when his name was called, spoke
                                   as follows: Mr. President--One word in explanation of my vote. In
                                   looking over this Senate and the House of Representatives, and
                                   listening to the roll-call of both houses, I see not a face nor
                                   hear a name responded to that was associated with me twenty-two
                                   years ago, when this remarkable section was added to the
                                   constitution of the State of Indiana: "It shall be the
                                   duty of the General Assembly to provide for the permanent
                                   enclosure of the Tippecanoe Battle Ground." Well
                                   knowing, Mr. President, the noble impulses that actuated the
                                   bosoms of the men of that day to make that imperative demand upon
                                   the Legislature of the State of Indiana, and being the only
                                   member of either house of the Legislature at this time that was
                                   associated with those men, and actuated now by the same noble
                                   impulses that actuated them, I cheerfully record my vote,
                                   "Aye."
                              Mr. HOUGH, in explanation of his vote, said that he now voted for
                                   the bill with as much cheerfulness as any member here--the clause
                                   allowing the expenditure of the surplus funds being stricken
                                   out.
                              Mr. NEFF, when his name was called, said: He also believed the bill
                                   in a much better shape than before the last amendment was made.
                                   The expenditure is now left in the discretion of the State
                                   officers. Before, they had no discretion. The $24,000 was to be
                                   paid out either for a fence or for a monument Now he was willing
                                   to vote for the bill.
                              Mr. TAYLOR took occasion, when his name was called, to state that
                                   the monument clause was put in the bill not at the request of his
                                   constituents or of himself.
                              The vote was then announced, as above.
                              So the bill passed the Senate.
                         
                         
                              WABASH AND ERIE CANAL.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS, by consent introduced a bill [S. 159] providing for
                                   the submission to the qualified electors of this State, for their
                                   ratification or rejection, a proposition to amend the
                                   Constitution of the State, by adding to the fifth article a
                                   provision in regard to the debt charged upon the Wabash and Erie
                                   Canal--[The election to be held on the----day of----]--no law or
                                   resolution shall be passed that shall recognize any liability of
                                   the State on account thereof, under the acts of 1846-47.
                              It was read the first time.
                              On motion of Mr. DWIGGINS the constitutional rule was suspended and
                                   the bill read the second time.
                              On motion by Mr. DWIGGINS, the blank was filled by inserting
                                   "the 28th day of January, 1873."
                              On his further motion the bill was considered as engrossed, and
                                   after some correction was read the third time and passed--yeas
                                   37, nays 0.
                         
                         
                              LEGISLATIVE APPORTIONMENT.
                              On motion by Mr. DWIGGINS. the bill [S. 146] redistricting the
                                   State for legislative purposes, was taken up aud read the second
                                   time. The bill is as follows:
                              An act to fix the number of Senators and Representatives in the
                                   General Assembly of the State of Indiana, and to apportion the

                                   with this act, and declare an emergency.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved that the bill be ordered engrossed.
                              Mr. GLESSNER moved that the bill be laid on the table and
                                   printed.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS moved to refer the bill to a committee of one from
                                   each Congressional District.
                              Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence moved to lay the motion to refer on the
                                   table.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS insisted that his motion took precedence.
                              The President pro tem. [Mr. DITTEMORE] decided that the motion of
                                   Mr. Williams to refer takes precedence, and the question is to
                                   lay that motion on the table.
                              This latter motion was agreed to by yeas 23, nays 14.
                              Mr. SLEETH demanded the previous question.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN desired that the bill should be laid on the
                                   table, to give him time to examine it. He was not ready to vote
                                   on the bill.
                              At a quarter before one o'clock the question being on
                                   seconding the demand for the previous question on the passage of
                                   the bill [S. 54] for an act to redistrict the State for
                                   Senatorial and Representative purposes, and the yeas and nays
                                   having been demanded, ordered and being taken thereon--
                              The Senate seconded the demand for the previous question by yeas
                                   23, nays 14.
                              Pending the roll-call--
                              Mr. WILLIAMS, when his name was called, desired to explain why he
                                   should vote, not only against seconding the demand for the
                                   previous question, but in opposition to the bill at any stage in
                                   the proceedings. Under this bill, he was understood to say, that
                                   Knox and Sullivan Counties with a population of 9,254, were only
                                   allowed one Senator and two Representatives, while the counties
                                   of Parke and Vermillion, with a population of 6,305 has the same
                                   representation. This of itself is too glaring a piece of
                                   injustice to ask of him support the demand for the previous
                                   question. Again, the population of the county of Allen, 10,316,
                                   get no more representation than Wayne with less than 8,000; there
                                   is injustice again. And when the counties of Dearborn and
                                   Franklin have a Senator and two Representatives, and the county
                                   of Randolph with a Senator and Representative, having a less
                                   population than the countv of Knox, there is injustice there.
                                   Then the counties of Union and Fayette, with scarce enough of a
                                   population to allow them a Representative without a Senator, are
                                   given a Senator and two Representatives, while his county [Knox]
                                   with nearly twice the population has only one joint Senator and
                                   one Representative. Is that all the injustice done by the bill?
                                   No, sir: He saw Tipton county deprived of the right of
                                   representation and overshadowed by Hamilton county, and he saw
                                   the whole power of Shelby county crippled by coupling it with
                                   Marion, and surely there is injustice there. It was too big a
                                   dose for him to vote to second the demand for the previous
                                   question. And why couple Montgomery county with the county of
                                   Parke, which has already more representation than it is entitled
                                   to, but for the purpose of overshadowing Montgomery county?
                                   Montgomery is included with Parke and not even allowed a
                                   Representative alone. When he saw such injustice as this towards
                                   the people of Indiana, disfranchised, as they are, he could not
                                   vote to sustain the previous question. If he were in the majority
                                   he would not present such a bill here, for an intelligent and
                                   honest body to sanction, and he was astonished to see Senators
                                   desiring to pass such a measure, and desiring to fasten it upon
                                   the people of the State for the next six years. Then Laporte
                                   county, with a population of 6,559, is allowed no more
                                   representation than the county of Randolph, with 4,804, thus
                                   disfranchising 1,800 of her citizens.
                              Mr. NEFF, interposing. Didn't you vote injustice to
                                   Delaware county two years ago?
                              Mr. WILLIAMS. I did not If the Senator wants to bring that matter
                                   up, he can have it as soon as he pleases, I could point out,
                                   perhaps, thirty other places in this bill almost, if not equally,
                                   as objectionable as the ones I have already pointed out.
                              The vote was then announced as above.
                              So the Senate seconded the demand for the previous question, and
                                   under its operation the vote on the motion to order the
                                   engrossment of the bill resulted as follows:

                              Pending the roll call--
                              Mr. GREGG, when his name was called, explained that he should vote
                                   against the motion, because it cuts off amendments, and there
                                   were two reasons why he would not vote to cut off all opportunity
                                   for offering amendinents to the bill. The first reason is, the
                                   bill should be amended. He found, by it, that the counties of
                                   Union and Fayette have one Senator, with a population of 4,250,
                                   while the counties of Franklin and Dearborn have but one,
                                   Franklin with a population of 4,548--a larger voting population
                                   in Franklin county alone than in the other entire district--and
                                   Dearborn has 5,500, the two together 10,048 votes. Is that
                                   honest? Is that fair? Ought he to vote to enforce a bill that
                                   disfranchises his people? This, he said, in addition to the
                                   remarks made by the Senator from Knox [Mr. Williams], and
                                   further, when a bill of that character is proposed to be pushed
                                   through this body, the minority will resort, I trust, to any
                                   measure to defeat it. Do you suppose I would dread going back to
                                   my people to avoid legislation of this kind or character? Or does
                                   the majority suppose that because there is a bolting act with, a
                                   penalty of $1,000 attached to it. that we would pay any attention
                                   to that while endeavoring to prevent the passage of such a
                                   measure as this, which would fasten such a wrong upon our people?
                                   I represent a people that pay almost as much tax as any Senator
                                   on this floor, and they are deeply interested in the
                                   representation they are to have in future legislation in this
                                   State, and for that reason I vote "No."
                              Mr. HARNEY, when his name was called, declared that he would not be
                                   very hard to please, but the bill before the Senate he could not
                                   support. Since being in this Assembly it has been a matter of
                                   congratulation to him that business has gone along so
                                   harmoniously. But it seems that after gentlemen of the majority
                                   have used our courtesy, after they have got through with us, like
                                   the ox that the farmer has put in his crop with, they will turn
                                   us over to the slaughter house. At the end of the session we come
                                   across a bill evidently fixed up in caucus and brought
                                   deliberately into the House, and all debate upon it is cut off.
                                   He could not see how gentlemen of the majority can expect that
                                   the minority can take any further interest in this Legislature
                                   being a success, only as their people were directly interested.
                                   There are some very dangerous precedents in this matter.
                                   Certainly, Indiana has had enough troubles of this kind to warn
                                   us to be careful of moving in this manner. Some States in the
                                   Union are utterly broken down, lost to the attributes that
                                   constitute a State from this miserable grasping by parties for
                                   power that they are not legitimately entitled to by their ratio
                                   of constituency. Louisiana to-day is a scene of what this
                                   grasping for power that is not warranted by the votes of the
                                   people would result in. Whether Kellogg or Warmoth is right is no
                                   question, but the result shows they are both villians, aiming to
                                   grasp that which does not belong to them. If this thing is to be
                                   carried on in this State and the State is to be divided so as to
                                   bring power into the hands of those that may be in the minority
                                   we can not tell what may come, because it is in direct violation
                                   of the principles on which our government is founded, and no one
                                   knows it better than the gentlemen in the majority do. These were
                                   some of the reasons why he could not vote for the engrossment of
                                   this bill, especially as he saw a disposition on the part of the
                                   majority not to legislate for the good of the State, and it could
                                   not be expected under the circumstances that the minority would
                                   do servile work for the majority, and then be trampled upon by
                                   them. He voted "no."
                              The vote was then announced as above recorded, so the bill was
                                   ordered to be engrossed.
                              Mr. GLESSNER moved, that when the Senate adjourn it adjourn until 2
                                   o'clock next Monday afternoon. The motion was
                                   rejected--yeas, 15; nays, 21.
                              On motion of Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence, the Senate then took a
                                   recess until 2 o'clock.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The Senate met at 2 o'clock.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE moved a call of the Senate.
                              The roll was called and twenty members answered to their names.
                              Mr. GOODING moved that the doorkeeper be dispatched for absent
                                   members.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE moved to adjourn. He said, to relieve the minds of
                                   Senators from any apprehensions they might have, he was
                                   authorized to say that the Democratic members would be here next
                                   Monday afternoon; but he thought it would be impossible to secure
                                   the attendance of a quorum this afternoon. He therefore insisted
                                   on his motion to adjoun.
                              The motion was rejected.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE then made an ineffectual motion that Mr.
                                   Gooding's motion be laid on the table. Mr.
                                   Gooding's motion was agreed to.
                              
                              Mr. DITTEMORE made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.
                              Mr. SLEETH suggested that if the Democratic members would come in
                                   and made a quorum the Senate could then go on and transact
                                   routine business involving questions of no political
                                   character.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE said he didn't want it understood that he
                                   was here representing a party of factionists. His motions were
                                   made simply because there was not a respectable number of members
                                   present, and he did not think it would be decorous or proper to
                                   do any business with so small a minorty.
                              Mr. GOODING said it came with a very bad grace from the gentleman
                                   on the other side of the House to refer to the vacant seats in
                                   the chamber. Having failed in the effort to have the Senate
                                   adjourn until Monday, they now sought, in utter disregard of the
                                   wishes of the majority of this body, to effect an adjournment by
                                   withdrawing themselves. He thought it would look better in the
                                   eyes of the people of the State of Indiana if they would come
                                   back and occupy their seats until they could get an adjournment
                                   in the usual way.
                              Mr. BIRD said if there had been any concert of action among the
                                   members of the party to which he belonged he was not aware of it.
                                   For one, he was the last man that would get out of his seat and
                                   go out of the House to prevent legislation.
                              When the roll-call showed thirty-four Senators present and
                                   answering to their names--
                              On motion, further proceedings under the call of the Senate were
                                   dispensed with.
                         
                         
                              RELIEF FROM RAILROAD TAXES.
                              Mr. SLEETH moved that the rules be suspended and the bill [S. 59]
                                   to relieve counties and townships upon which a railroad tax has
                                   been levied, under the act of 1869, from collection of the same
                                   until anamount of work has been done by the road equal to the
                                   amount of taxes levied, be taken up.
                              The motion was agreed to by yeas. 23, nays, 12.
                              Mr. CARNAHAN thought the bill was defective in that it did not
                                   provide for the return of taxes already collected until the work
                                   was done by the railroad. He said in Posey county they had
                                   collected more than $100,000, which was tied up in a bank at Mt.
                                   Vernon. He favored the passage of some measure of the kind, but
                                   believed that there is a house bill on the files, embodying
                                   better provisions: would prefer to see the house bill passed,
                                   probably with some amendments; and he moved to lay this one on
                                   the table. He withdrew the motion for
                              Mr. BROWN, who explained the difference between the two bills. The
                                   bill under consideration simply provides that no levy shall be
                                   made to place a lieu upon property until the road shall be
                                   permanently located.
                              Mr. SLEETH said a bill had passed the other House providing for the
                                   refunding of taxes in such cases, which in no way interfered with
                                   the provisions of this bill, an which should be passed
                                   independently.
                              The yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and taken, Mr.
                                   Carnahan's motion was rejected by yeas 13, nays 26.
                              Mr. GLESSNER moved that the bill be recommitted to the Committee,
                                   on the Judiciary, and demanded the yeas and nays.
                              The motion being made before the chair had finished stating the
                                   question, it was ruled out of order.
                              Mr. BROWN demanded the previous question, which being ordered the
                                   bill passed yeas 26, nays 11 as follows :
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             YEAS--Messrs. Beardsley, Beeson,
                                                  Bird, Bowman, Brown, Bunyan, Chapman, Collett,
                                                  Daggy, Dwiggins, Friedley of Scott, Gooding,
                                                  Haworth, Hough, Howard, Hubbard, Miller, Neff,
                                                  O'Brien, Oliver, Scott, Sleeth, Taylor,
                                                  Thompson, Wadge and Mr. President--26.
                                             NAYS--Messrs. Armstrong,
                                                  Carnahan, Cave, Glessner, Gregg, Harney,
                                                  Sarnighausen, Slater, Smith, Stroud, and
                                                  Williams--11.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Pending the roll-call--
                              Mr. CARNAHAN, in explanation said as far as he had examined the
                                   bill he was in favor of it, but as the matter now stands he
                                   should vote "no."
                              Mr. HARNEY, when his name was called, said that inasmuch as he had
                                   not examined this bill very well [laughter] and not in a
                                   condition to give it that critical examination he should, he
                                   would vote "no."
                              Mr. SCOTT, in explanation, thought this bill calculated to relieve
                                   what has amounted to a great inconvenience to many counties in
                                   this State, and although he didn't like it should vote
                                   for it because he thought it more favorable to the people than to
                                   the railroads.
                              Mr. SLATER, when his name was called, said he liked the provisions
                                   of this bill, but as he would be found in bad company he would
                                   not vote for it.
                              Mr. THOMPSON, in explanation, said he would vote against anything
                                   that will prevent men making promises that they never mean to
                                   fulfill, but as there is a provision in this bill that where a
                                   tax is levied it shall not be collected until the road is
                                   actually located, he would vote "aye."
                              The vote was then announced as above recorded.
                              
                              So the bill passed the Senate.
                         
                         
                              VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATIONS.
                              Mr. THOMPSON moved that the bill [S. 40] be taken up and read the
                                   second time.
                              The motion was agreed to--yeas, 26; nays, 11.
                              Accordingly the bill [S. 40], to amend section two of the voluntary
                                   association act of February 12, 1855, was read the second
                                   time.
                              Mr. THOMPSON moved to dispense with the Constitutional restriction,
                                   that the bill may be read the third time now.
                              The motion was rejected.
                         
                         
                              CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.
                              Mr. BROWN moved that the order of business be suspended for the
                                   purpose of reading the bill [H. R. 137] the first and second time
                                   only, that it may be referred. (The bill provides that in
                                   criminal prosecutions the Prosecuting Attorney shall have the
                                   open and close of the case.)
                              The motion was agreed to--yeas, 23; nays, 11.
                              The bill [H. R. 137] to amend section 103 of the criminal practice
                                   act of June 17,1852, was read the second time.
                              Mr. BROWN said this was a very important measure, which had been
                                   largely discussed by the papers, and especially the Democratic
                                   papers, and was very dear to the Democratic heart. In order to
                                   quiet the nerves of his Democratic brethren he would now move
                                   that the rule be suspended and the bill be put upon its
                                   passage.
                              Mr. GLESSNER moved that the motion be laid on the table, and
                                   demanded the yeas and nays thereon. The vote stood: Yeas. 14;
                                   nays, 22.
                              So the motion was rejected.
                              Mr. HARNEY moved to adjourn, and the yeas and nays being demanded,
                                   ordered and taken, resulted--yeas, 13; nays, 24.
                              Mr. BROWN demanded the previous question on the motion to suspend
                                   the rule.
                              Mr. GLESSNER and others demanding the yeas and nays, the vote
                                   resulted--yeas, yeas, 23; nays 14.
                              So the rule was not suspended.
                              Mr. BROWN moved that the bill be recommitted to the Juciciary
                                   Committee.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. GOODING moved to suspend the order of business in order to
                                   permit him to introduce a short bill. The yeas and nays were
                                   demanded, and the vote resulted--yeas, 25; nays, 9.
                              So the motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. GOODING then introduced a bill [S. 160] to amend the act
                                   incorporating the Lawrenceburg Insurance Company, which was read
                                   the first time and passed to the second reading.
                              The order of business being again suspended, on motion by Mr.
                                   DWIGGINS by yeas 21, nays 14--taken on the demand by Messrs.
                                   Gregg and Glessnerthe bill [S. 49] to amend section 22 of the
                                   town incorporation act of June 11, 1852, was read the second
                                   time.
                              Mr. ------ moved that the Senate adjourn.
                              Messrs. DITTEMORE, CAVE, GREGG and two other Senators demanding the
                                   yeas and nays, they were ordered, and being taken, resulted--yeas
                                   16, nays 20.
                              So the Senate refused to adjourn.
                              Mr. ARMSTRONG moved to suspend the order, so as to take up the bill
                                   [S. 150] to legalize taxes levied by School Trustees without
                                   authority. The motion was agreed to; the bill was read by title
                                   only, and referred to the appropriate committee.
                              On motion of Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Scott, the Twenty-ninth Judicial
                                   Circuit bill [H. R. 72] was read by title, and referred to the
                                        Committee on Organization of Courts.
                              Mr. GREGG for the Senator from Jefferson (Mr. Francisco), presented
                                   a remonstrance from the bar of county against re-establishing the
                                   criminal court.
                              It was referred with the bill.
                              And then the Senate adjourned till Monday morning, 10
                                   o'clock.
                         
                         
                    
                    
                    
                         THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                         
                         THIRTEENTH VOLUME.
                         
                         INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
                         
                         HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                         
                              SATURDAY, December 14, 1872.
                         
                         The House was calsed to order at 9 a. m. by the SPEAKER, and prayer was
                              offered by Rev. H. R. Naylor, pastor of Meridian street M. E.
                              Church.
                         
                              REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE, from the Committee on Banks,
                                   returned Mr. Givan's bill [H. R. 60] to provide for the
                                   assessment and collection of taxes on the capital stock and
                                   shares of stock in all banks and associations doing banking
                                   business in the State, etc., reporting that the matter of the
                                   bill is embraced in a bill that has already passed the house,
                                   (the bill to provide for the uniform assignment and collection of
                                   taxes reported from the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means.) and therefore he recommended its
                                   indefinite postponement.
                              Mr. GIVAN hoped the report would not be concurred in. The general
                                   tax law made no provision for the manner in which national banks
                                   should be taxed. The law was merely silent upon the subject, and
                                   only permitted them to be taxed.
                              The report of the Committee was not concurred in, and the bill
                                   ordered to the engrossment.
                              Mr. HEDRICK, from the Committee on Rights and
                                        Privileges, reported back Mr. Barrett's
                                   bill [H. R. 82] to repeal the fish protection law, with the
                                   recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed.
                              The SPEAKER. That matter has already been once indefinitely
                                   postponed.
                              On a motion of Mr. RICHARDSON, the report was laid on the
                                   table.
                              Mr. HEDRICK returned Mr. Gifford's bill [H. R. 227],
                                   providing for the payment to Township Trustees of all moneys
                                   collected for general or special purposes, except such as are
                                   collected for State and county revenue, with an amendment, adding
                                   to the title these words: "and declaring an
                                   emergency."
                              The SPEAKER. You can't amend the title till after the bill
                                   has passed. Send the papers back for correction of the
                                   report.
                              Mr. HEDRICK immediately returned the bill by the messenger with his
                                   report corrected by the erasure of the titular amendment, leaving
                                   in the report simply the recommendation for the passage of the
                                   bill.
                              The report was concurred in and the bill ordered to the
                                   engrossment.
                              Mr. OGDEN, from the Committee on Corporations,
                                   returned the bill [S. 3], to amend section 4 of the act
                                   concerning the organization and perpetuity of voluntary
                                   associations, and repealing the acts of 1855 and February 12,
                                   1867, recommending passage. It was passed to the third
                                   reading.
                              Mr. GIFFORD, from the Committee on Cities and
                                        Towns, returned Mr. Peed's bill [H. R.
                                   185] to legalize the acts of the Board of Trustees of the town of
                                   Huntersburg, in Dubois county, and all other towns of the State
                                   similarly situated in regard to the legality of assessments for
                                   school and other purposes, with a recommendation that it pass. It
                                   was ordered to be engrossed.
                         
                         
                         
                              THE CARROLL COUNTX CASE--JOSEPH A. SIMS
                              Mr. RICHARDSON, from the special committee on that subject,
                                   reported the following:

                                                  investigation of the disposition of certain moneys
                                                  alleged to have been collected upon judgments
                                                  obtained in the Carroll Circuit Court on the
                                                  relation of John D. Evans, Auditor of State,
                                                  against Joseph Evans, and William Dunible,
                                                  executors of Samuel Gaines, late of Carroll
                                                  county, Indiana, begs leave to report: That Joseph
                                                  A. Sims came in person and upon his oath testified
                                                  that he had been employed upon a written contract
                                                  with T. B. McCarty, Auditor of State, G. W. Hoss,
                                                  Superintendent of Public Instruction, together

                                                  Instruction of the State of Indiana; and that as
                                                  such attorney he instituted the suit above named,
                                                  prosecuted the same to judgments amounting to

                                                  other witnesses, and the receipts given by Joseph
                                                  A. Sims to William Dumble upon the receipt of the

                                             Your committee being of the opinion that the
                                                  validity of the contract upon which said money was
                                                  obtained, as well also as whether the officers of
                                                  State transcended their powers in entering into
                                                  the contract with Sims, are questions to be
                                                  determined by legal tribunals only; therefore,
                                                  your committee would present herewith a record of
                                                  the evidence, together with a copy of the contract
                                                  aforesaid, and recommend the adoption of the
                                                  accompanying resolution on the partof the House of
                                                  Representatives--requesting for themselves to be
                                                  discharged, etc.
                                             Resolved, That the Attorney
                                                  General of the State be, and he is hereby,
                                                  requested to make all necessary investigations as
                                                  to the legality of the disposition of the money
                                                  collected upon the judgments obtained in the

                                                  of John D. Evans vs. Joseph Evans and William
                                                  Bumble, executioners of Samuel Grimes, late of
                                                  Carroll county, deceased; and if in his opinion
                                                  the money retained by Joseph A. Sims can be
                                                  recovered, or any considerable portion of it,
                                                  either from Sims or from the parties in contract
                                                  with said Sims for the collection of said money,
                                                  that the said Attorney General, by and with the
                                                  advice and consent of the Superintendent of Public
                                                  Instruction, Secretary of the Stave and the
                                                  Governor, shall institute suit for the recovery of
                                                  the same. The report was concurred in and the
                                                  resolution adopted.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Mr. KING, in behalf of the Committee on
                                        Railroads, returned Mr. Isenhower's bill
                                   [H. R. 117] supplemental to the act of May 12, 1869, to authorize
                                   aid in the construction of railroads by counties and townships
                                   taking stock therein, etc., recommending that it be laid on the
                                   table, and that the following be substituted therefor, viz.: A
                                   bill [H. R. 235] supplemental to the act to authorize aid in the
                                   construction of railroads, etc., approved May 12, 1869: which was
                                   read the first time.
                              Mr. THOMPSON, of Elkhart, suggested that the bill be laid aside for
                                   the consideration of the similar bill from the Senate--the bill
                                   [S. 25] which is now on the third reading.
                              On motion of Mr. PEEP, the substitute bill [H. R. 235] was laid on
                                   the table.
                         
                         
                              COUNTY RAILROAD AID STOCK.
                              The bill [S. 25] to refund money raised by taxation for railroads
                                   to the tax payers, to require railroad companies to issue
                                   certificates of stock to the counties and townships for such aid,
                                   and to issue certificates for unclaimed stock subscribed and paid
                                   under the provisions of act of May 12, 1869, was then taken up
                                   and read the third time. (The unclaimed stock to go to the local
                                   school fundsuch certificates to be issued to the townships in
                                   proportion to their number of school children from 6 to 21
                                   years.)
                              Mr. SHIRLEY submitted an amendment to the seventh section,
                                   inserting a clause to this effect: "The stock so issued
                                   being involuntary, no personal liability shall follow to the
                                   holders thereof for any debt contracted by the said railroad
                                   companies."
                              Mr. PEED. There is no occasion for the amendment. This act compels
                                   no party to take these certificates. Where there is danger let
                                   the parties refuse to take it.
                              Mr. LENFESTY had been opposing this bill till this amendment was
                                   offered. It is very important. Gentlemen know, that when a
                                   railroad has contracted for labor, every stockholder becomes
                                   liable for that labor after the assets of the railroad have been
                                   expended. By accepting these certificates every farmer in the
                                   country may become a stockholder, and if a stockholder is liable
                                   for the debts of the road, he becomes liable to the workmen
                                   thereon to the extent of all he possesses. Now, this amendment
                                   provides against that liability.
                              The amendment was adopted.
                              On motion of Mr. PEED, the bill was considered as engrossed and the
                                   bill, as amended, was read the third time and finally passed the
                                   House of Representatives.
                              On motion of Mr. THOMPSON, of Elkhart, the matter just laid on the
                                   table, viz.: the committee bill [H.R. 235] supplemental to the
                                   act to authorize counties and twonships to aid in the
                                   construction of railroads, etc., approved may 12, 1869, was taken
                                   up and (there being had a suspension of the constitutional
                                   restriction,) the bill was carried through the readings and
                                   passed the House of Representatives--yeas, 70; nays, 0.
                              [This bill provides that in cases where money has been collected by
                                   tax for county or township aid to railroads, and has remained in
                                   the treasury unclaimed two years, it shall be redistributed to
                                   the tax- payers in the
                                   proportion in which it was collected--provided that the County
                                   Commissioners or Township Trustees may determine to cover the
                                   same into the general fund of the county or township, as the case
                                   may be, in which case the tax-payers from whom the money was
                                   collected shall have credit for such amounts as are paid by them
                                   in the collection of future taxes.]
                         
                         
                              CLAIMS.
                              Messrs. Riggs, Lenfesty, Hedrick and Cobb, from the
                                        Committee on Claims, severally reported
                                   for allowance of claims, to wit: The claim of James N. Kimball
                                   for $250, on account of legal services; the claim of Henry
                                   Colman, for $15; the claim of the Sunday Post publishers, for
                                   $780 95; the claim of E. B. Beauchamp, for 108--reduced to $81;

                                   severally allowed, and referref to the Committee on
                                        Ways and Means, with instructions that they be
                                   incorporated into the specific appropriation bill.
                              Mr. COBB returned the claim of Barber and Jacobs for $2,800 for
                                   legal services, recommending that it be allowed and incorporated
                                   into the specific bill; but objection being made, it was referred
                                   to the Committee on the Judiciary.
                              Mr. OFFUTT submitted a motion to reconsider the vote on which the
                                   House adopted the report of the Committee on
                                        Claims reducing the claim of Jonathan W. Gordon,
                                   to $250, desiring to recommit the report so that Mr. Gordon can
                                   be heard before the committee.
                              The report was withdrawn by unanimous consent.
                              Mr. HELLER submitted a resolution that the Senate be requested to
                                   take up Mr. Wilson of Ripley's per diem and mileage
                                   bill, and finally dispose of the same.
                              The SPEAKER. It is against the rules--can't be
                                   entertained.
                              Mr. OFFUTT moved to reconsider the vote by which Mr. Edwards of
                                   Lawrence's bill [H. R. 95] repealing the act authorizing
                                   counties and townships to vote aid for railroads, was made the
                                   special order for Wednesday.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              And then, on the motion of Mr. KING, it was made the special order
                                   for Monday afternoon.

                                   o'clock Monday p. m.
                              It was agreed to.
                              The SPEAKER took up the call of the counties and districts
                                   for--

                              It was referred to the Committee on County and Township
                                        Business.

                                   "majority of the free holders."
                              The SPEAKER. Write out your instructions and give them to the
                                        Committee on Education.

                              JUDICIAL APPORTIONMENT.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. I move to take from the table the resolution to
                                   provide for raising a committee to inquire into the matter of
                                   re-circuiting and re-districting the State for judicial
                                   purposes.
                              The resolution was sought for, but not found, by the Clerk.
                              The SPEAKER. The resolution cannot be found, so the matter will be
                                   passed over for the present.
                              Mr. CLAYPOOL introduced a bill [H. R. 241] to give security to
                                   persons who contract with railroads and other incorporated

                                   making excavations, or bridge and trusael work. (It gives a lien
                                   on such works, on the materials furnished and on the interest of
                                   the railroad company in the land on which the labor has been
                                   performed.)

                                   not otherwise.]
                              It was referred to the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary.
                              Mr. TROUTMAN submitted a preamble and resolution, reciting that the
                                   national banking system does not afford an adequate circulating
                                   medium, and that public propriety required legislation for
                                   remedy; and therefore requesting the Judiciary
                                        Committee to inquire what legislation is necessary
                                   to establish a banking system similar to the national banking
                                   system.
                              On motion of Mr. MILLER, it was laid on the table.

                                   define the time in which the same may be taken and killed, and to
                                   repeal the amendatory act of March 11, 1867.
                              It was referred to the Committee on
                                   Agriculture.
                              Mr. PEED introduced a bill [H. R. 244] to amend section 10 of the
                                   act of March, 6, 1865, to provide for a general system of common
                                   schools.

                                   the non-payment of fines which may have been adjudged against
                                   them for any public offense against the penal laws of the State.
                                   (The Governor may grant leave of absence which shall be filed
                                   with the County Clerk, revokable at the pleasure of the
                                   Governor.)
                              It was referred to the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary.
                              Mr. JOHNSON, a bill [H. R 246] concernng the granting of pardons by
                                   the Governor. (The Governor to grant pardons revokable at his
                                   pleasure.)
                              It was referred to the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary.
                              Mr. JOHNSON introduced a bill [H. R. 247] in relation to the
                                   selection of jurors in certain cases therein named. (No person
                                   shall be dfsqualified to act as a juror on trials for treason or
                                   murder on account of his opinions or scruples as to capital
                                   punishment.)
                              It was referred to the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary.
                              Mr. JOHNSON introduced a bill [H. R. 248] for the preservation of
                                   evidence in certain cases; providing for the appointment of
                                   official reporters in the Courts of this State and providing for
                                   their compensation. (The Judges of the Courts in a city of not
                                   less than 40,000 inhabitants may appoint, etc, estimate and make
                                   the allowance of compensation, etc.)
                              It was referred to the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN introduced a bill [H. R. 249] to fix the salary of the
                                   Judges of the Supreme Court of Indiana. He intimated his desire
                                   to fill the blank with $4,000 for information.
                              Mr. KING suggested $5,000.
                              The SPEAKER suggested that the time for amendments is on the
                                   question for the second reading.
                              Mr. BRANHAM moved a suspension that the bill be read the second
                                   time now.
                              Mr. WALKER. This ought to go through with the other bills for the
                                   compensation of all the judges.
                              The rules and constitutional restriction were dispensed with--yeas
                                   60, nays 26--and the bill was read the second time by title.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN now moved to fill the blank with $4,000. Mr. SHIRLEY
                                   moved for $4,500. Mr. KING for $5,000. The latter amendments were rejected,
                                   and Mr. Cauthorn's was adopted.
                              Mr. THAYER submitted a motion that the bill be referred to the
                                        Committee on Fees and Salaries. I am in
                                   favor of this bill, but I am afraid we can't pass it
                                   singly--without the propositions for raising the salaries of
                                   other judges; and I think it is just as important that the Common
                                   Pleas and Circuit Judges should have reasonable
                                   remunerations.
                              The motion prevailed, and the bill was referred to the
                                        Committee on Fees and Salaries.

                                   railroads by counties and townships taking stock therein,
                                   approved May 12, 1869.

                              It was referred to the Committee on Statistics and
                                        Emigration.

                                   the powers and duties of Justices.

                                   to incorporate the Lawrenceburg Insurance Company. (To make it
                                   the Citizens' Insurance Company, and to remove its
                                   business to Evansville).
                              It was referred to the Committee on
                                   Insurance.
                              Mr. BAXTER presented a petition for a prohibitory liquor law, and
                                   another from the Society of Friends asking the abolition of
                                   capital punishment.
                              Mr. WALKER called up Bill 233, to divide the State into thirteen
                                   Congressional Districts, and it was referred to the
                                        Committee on Elections.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, asked that Bill 214, relating to descents
                                   and apportionments of estates be referred to the

                                   emergency for its immediate operaton.
                              The Senate amendment was concurred in by unanimous consent.
                              The bill [S. 115] was taken up on first reading, but proceedings
                                   were interrupted by the reception of another message from the

                              Mr. WILLIAMS moved that the rules be suspended and the bill read by

                                   each Congressional district.
                              Mr. BROWN said he hoped the motion would not prevail. He had
                                   received a letter this morning from a leading Democrat of Jackson
                                   county, saying that the Democrats of that county favored the bill
                                   introduced by the Republican party. The bill just introduced
                                   disfranchises Jackson county entirely, and he would not dare to
                                   go home to his Democratic constituents without entering his
                                   protest against it. He moved to lay the motion on the table.
                              Before the question was put, Mr. Williams withdrew his motion.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE demanded a call of the Senate and 36 members were
                                   found to be present.
                         
                         
                              POSTOFFICE AT EVANSVILLE.
                              Mr. GOODING moved to suspend the rules and take up the bill [S.
                                   87].
                              The motion was agreed to, and the bill [S. 87] granting the consent
                                   of Indiana to the purchase by the United States of one or more
                                   pieces of land in Evansville, on which to erect a postoffice and
                                   ether public buildings, was read the third time and passed--yeas,
                                   35; nays, 0.
                              On motion of Mr. BOWMAN, the bill [S. 118] changing the terms of
                                   courts in the Second Judicial Circuit, was passed--yeas, 35; nays
                                   0.
                         
                         
                              BANKS.
                              On motion by Mr. STEELE, the bill [S. 2] to authorize and regulate
                                   the incorporation of banks of discount and deposit in the State
                                   of Indiana was read the third time.
                              The bill passed the Senate--yeas, 33; nays, 1.
                         
                         
                         
                              TWELFTH CIRCUIT.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved to still further suspend the order of business
                                   that the court bill [H. R. 124] to fix the time of courts in the
                                   Twelfth Judicial Circuit--White, Newton, Jasper, Benton and
                                   Tippecanoe--may be read the second time.
                              The motion was agreed to, and the bill was read accordingly.
                              And then came the recess for dinner.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The Senate met at 2 o'clock P. M.
                              Mr. BOONE, by leave, from the Committee on
                                        Education, returned the bill [S. 86] to amend
                                   section 1 of the city and town school building bond bill,
                                   approved March 11, 1867, with amendments, limiting the rate of
                                   interest on such bond to ten per cent. per annum.
                              On motion by Mr. RHODES his bill [S. 86], just reported from the
                                        Committee on Education, was read the
                                   second time. He moved for a dispensation of the constitutional
                                   restriction that the bill may be put upon its passage.
                              This motion was agreed to.
                              The bill was indefinitely postponed on the statement by Mr.
                                   FRIEDLEY that it was superseded by another bill.
                         
                         
                              JUDGES' SALARIES.
                              The President pro tem. announced the special order--being the bill
                                   [S. 9] fixing the salaries of the judges of this State.
                              On motion it was postponed till to-morrow at 2
                                   o'clock.
                              Mr. THOMPSON moved for a suspension of the order of business that
                                   the voluntary association bill [S. 60] may be taken up.
                              The motion was agreed to, the bill was read the third time, and
                                   passed--yeas, 36; nays, 6.
                         
                         
                              EIGHT DOLLARS A DAY.
                              On motion of Mr. BROWN the bill [H. R. 73] fixing the per diem and
                                   mileage of members of the Legislature (eight dollars a day and
                                   five dollars for every 25 miles traveled), was read the third
                                   time.
                              Mr. NEFF desired to offer an amendment providing that members also
                                   furnish their own books, papers and other printed matter. He
                                   thought unless some of the leaks were stopped the present pay was
                                   enough. If members wanted to send daily papers to their
                                   constituents, they should pay for them. He was opposed to the
                                   franking privilege in Congress, and for the same reason, if
                                   members of the Assembly wanted to send papers home as
                                   electioneering documents, he thought they should bear the
                                   expense. With regard to books, he believed they ought to be
                                   returned by members at the end of the session.
                              Mr. DAGGY thought that it was contrary to the spirit of the
                                   Constitution that members should increase their pay during their
                                   term of service. But, outside of that, is it right that they do
                                   so? and on that proposition he was prepared to vote no. Senators
                                   were elected under an implied agreement that they should receive
                                   five dollars a day, and now, when they have the power, they
                                   propose to increase it to eight dollars per day. He thought it
                                   was wrong.
                              Mr. BROWN said he had about as intelligent and economical a
                                   constituency as any Senator and he did not believe there were
                                   twenty-five intelligent men in his county who did not approve
                                   this bill. But in any event, he believed that the bill was just
                                   and right, and should vote for it regardless of the
                                   consequences.
                              Mr. STEELE said it seemed to be conceded on all hands that the
                                   measure involved nothing wrong; the only question was one of
                                   policy. Even at $8 a day, the most of those who came here would
                                   do so at a pecuniary sacrifice. Five dollars a day considering
                                   the expense of living at the capital, is not a reasonable
                                   compensation. This being the case, he thought that the bill was
                                   not only not improper, but was doing but partial justice to
                                   members of the Assembly. He supposed that the Constitutional
                                   provision meant what it said, that the pay of members should not
                                   be increased during the session. For himself he was willing to
                                   take the responsibility of voting for the bill, and would go
                                   before his constituents on this question as he had on many
                                   others, and submit to their verdict.
                              Mr. ORR said the position which he should take was one to which he
                                   had been educated by the Republican party, that fees and salaries
                                   should be reduced to a fair compensation. He thought that because
                                   the compensation of members was fixed at $5 a day when they were
                                   elected, it would be improper for them, now that they were
                                   elected, to amend the law for their own benefit. He doubted
                                   whether in voting to increase the salaries of the Governor and
                                   the Judges, the Republican members were fulfilling their pledges
                                   to the people in the late campaign.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE thought that in acting on this question Senators
                                   should rise above political motives and do that which is right.
                                   It is well known that $5 a day is not enough to pay the ordinary
                                   expenses of a legislator at the capital. The labors which Senators perform is
                                   not confined to the State chamber. The most of them are on
                                   important committees, and their labors often extend far into the
                                   night. Under all the circumstances he believed the bill was
                                   right, and should vote for it accordingly.
                              Mr. DAGGY said he had no personal interest in the matter, but he
                                   believed that an increase of compensation would reduce the
                                   qualityof the General Assembly. Make it a paying office and there
                                   would be a scramble for the position, and the most unworthy men
                                   would be likely to succeed.
                              Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence, believed it would be a matter of simple
                                   justice to the members of the General Assembly to increase their
                                   compensation, not to $8, but to $10 per day. The members of
                                   Legislatures in the States all around us are receiving $10 per
                                   day, and are not the services of the members of this Assembly
                                   worth as much as theirs? The people of Indiana are intelligent
                                   and liberal, and will indorse every just appropriation. He
                                   apprehended there was not a Senator on the floor that was not
                                   losing money every day by means of his presence in this body. The
                                   Republican party has always been and is in favor of economy in
                                   the administration of affairs, State and National. But it is also
                                   a plank in its platform that "the laborer is worthy of
                                   his hire." The opposition to slavery was based on that
                                   plank. He did not believe that the people of Indiana wanted their
                                   representatives to serve them for an inadequate compensation.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS demanded the previous question.
                              The Senate seconded the demand, and under the operation of the
                                   previous question the bill prssed the Senate by yeas 28, nays 16,
                                   as follows:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             YEAS--Messrs. Beeson, Bird,
                                                  Bowman, Brown, Carnahan, Cave, Collett, Dittemore,
                                                  Francisco, Glessner, Gooding, Hall, Harney, Hough,

                                                  Stroud, Taylor, Wadge, and Mr. President--28.
                                             NAYS--Messrs. Beardsley, Boone,
                                                  Bunyan, Chapman, Daggy, Dwiggins, Friedley, of
                                                  Scott, Gregg, Haworth, Miller, Neff, Orr, Slater,
                                                  Thompson, Williams, and Winterbotham--16.
                                        
                                   
                              
                         
                         
                              LEGISLATIVE APPORTIONMENT.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved to suspend the order of business that the bill
                                   [S. 146] to apportion the State for Senatorial and Representative
                                   purposes may be read the third time.
                              This was followed by motions to lay upon the table, calls of the
                                   Senate, the previous question, etc., accompanied by a running
                                   debate.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS moved ineffectually to lay the motion on the
                                   table--yeas 19, nays 23.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved the previous question.
                              The motion was carried by the following vote:

                                                  Sarnighausen, Slater, Smith, Stroud, Williams, and
                                                  Winterbotham--18.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Pending the roll call--
                              Mr. O'BRIEN, when his name was called remarked that he
                                   didn't like the situation. He was compelled to vote
                                   against the bill in all its features as it now stands. It takes
                                   the Senatorial district which he represented and gives it a
                                   voting population of something over 11,000, when 7,000 and a few
                                   odd hundred are all that have been necessary. He claimed to
                                   represent the banner Republican county of the State, and that
                                   county is about one-half disfranchised by this bill and he could
                                   not vote for it. They take Clinton county off of the district of
                                   Boone and put it on his district. Without that county the
                                   districts were very nearly equal in size and population. How
                                   gentlemen could conceive that it was necessary to take Clinton
                                   county and add it to the district composed of Hamilton and
                                   Tipton, and then give Boone a Senator alone, he could not see. He
                                   did not believe the bill was constitutional, or equitable or
                                   just, and he could not vote for it. He never voted with the
                                   Democratic party before in his life, and was ashamed that he had
                                   to do it now. But if he found the Democratic party right and the
                                   Republican party wrong, he was the man to stand up here and vote
                                   with the Democrats from now until Doomsday. [Applause.]
                              Mr. OLIVER, in explanation of his vote said there were things about
                                   this bill he did not like; however, under the circumstances he
                                   supposed it to be as good a bill as can be gotten up. He should
                                   vote for it under protest.
                              Mr. THOMPSON, when his name was called, said he had not been able
                                   to examine the bill, but he knew the men who got it up, and
                                   knowing the veracity and honesty of the Senators from Jasper [Mr
                                   Dwiggins] and Scott, [Mr. Friedley] he should vote for the
                                   bill.
                              Mr. WINTERBOTHAM, when his name was called, said that he
                                   represented the counties of Laporte and Stark, and those two counties have a joint
                                   representation. The county of Stark casts about 800 votes, and
                                   this bill takes Stark county and attaches it to St. Joseph, with
                                   6,000 voters, when the counties are only joined by part of a
                                   township. Is it just to take the county of Stark and attach it to
                                   the county of St. Joseph, when they are only joined by part of a
                                   township, and leave Marshall county with 4,000 on the east of
                                   Stark, when St. Joseph has 6,000? Is this just, is this proper?
                                   Mr. President, I have to vote no.
                              The bill then passed by yeas, 26; nays, 18.

                                                  Glessner, Gregg, Hall, Harney, O'Brien,
                                                  Sarnighausen, Slater, Smith, Stroud Williams,
                                                  Winterbotham--18.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Pending the roll call--
                              Mr. BIRD, in explanation of his vote, said that the bill is a very
                                   unfair one, for it takes from the county of Allen one member and
                                   gives it to another county, which is not entitled to it. Allen
                                   county, with 10,300 votes, only gets one Senator and two
                                   Representatives, while the county of Marion, having but 15,000,
                                   gets two Senators, four Representatives and one with Shelby, and
                                   it certainly is not twice as large as the county of Allen. There
                                   is some unfairness in this bill, and he should be obliged under
                                   the circumstances to vote "no."
                              Mr. BOONE, when his name was called in explanation of his vote,
                                   said that in his judgment it was unconstitutional, and in
                                   addition to that some of the districts do not seem to be composed
                                   of contiguous territory.
                              Mr. CAVE, in explanation of his vote, said the bill was very
                                   unjust, and he was not surprised. He was not surprised to see the
                                   action of the majority. Some of his Democratic friends had
                                   remarked that they were surprised, but he was not. He said they
                                   have resorted to everything that is unjust and unfair in the
                                   passage of this bill. They have applied the gag law and gag rule
                                   in every particular. Mr. President, it is unjust, it is unfair,
                                   and it is diabolical in its provisions in every particular. And,
                                   Mr. President, I must and am compelled to vote
                                   "no."
                              Mr. DITTEMORE, when his name was called, said he did not complain
                                   particularly on his own account, but when he saw dissensions
                                   among his Republican friends he could not but think there had
                                   been some "gouging" done. To enable his friend
                                   from Hamilton (Mr. O'Brien) torectify some of the
                                   injustice that had been perpetrated, he would vote
                                   "no."
                              Mr. DWIGGINS, in explanation of his vote, said the Senator from
                                   Knox (Mr. Williams) objected particularly to the bill because the
                                   county of Randolph, with less than 5,000 population, less than
                                   Knox, had been given a Senator. But this morning the Senator from
                                   Knox introduced a bill in which Randolph was given a Senator
                                   precisely as in this bill. He, therefore, concluded that the
                                   Senator from Knox had become reconciled to the bill, and was
                                   ready to vote for it.
                              Mr. GLESSNER, when his name was called, said: As this is the first
                                   opportunity the Senators on this side of the house have had to
                                   give their opinion on this bill, I now ask a moment for the
                                   purpose of explaining my vote. This bill, if I remember right,
                                   was introduced on Thursday ar Friday, I am not sure which. It was
                                   on Friday. The first time in the history of this special session
                                   that knowledge came to Senators that a bill of this sort was to
                                   be introduced, was on Friday. That was on the first reading of
                                   the bill. On Saturday, on motion, I believe, of the Senator from
                                   Jasper, [Mr. Dwiggins,] the rules were suspended that the bill
                                   might be taken up and read the second time. When that motion was
                                   made, but little resistance was offered to it. Up to this time,
                                   however, Senators had no opportunity to learn what the bill
                                   contained, except by its second reading, and Senators will agree
                                   with me that it is very difficult and almost impossible for
                                   Senators to gather up the entire merits or demerits of a bill on
                                   its first reading. We thought it due to the minority on this
                                   floor, which is very respectabla in numbers--I believe the
                                   minority have twenty-three members on this floor, while the
                                   majority have but twenty-seven--as we had gone along up to that
                                   time, knowing the majority was responsible for the character and
                                   extent of legislation this session, and nothing has been thrown
                                   in the way of legitimate legislation; but we had given our will
                                   and vote up that time.
                              Mr. BROWN (interposing). Does the Senator wish to make an argument
                                   or explain his vote?
                              Mr. GLESSNER. I desire to give the reason why I shall vote as I do.
                                   As I was about to say the majority know, and I presume will
                                   admit, that up to the time this bill was introduced on Friday we
                                   had thrown nothing in the way of fair and legitimate legislation.
                                   We had voted almost on all occasions to suspend the rule and the
                                   order of busi- ness and the
                                   constitutional restriction for every Senator on the other side of
                                   the Chamber, although we had special measures we desired to get
                                   through. As I said we did nothing to obstruct the progress of
                                   busniess and were willing to aid the majority in the enactment of
                                   all measures we conceived to be right and proper, and aid them in
                                   doing a large amount of business at this special session,
                                   therefore, it was my judgment--I had formed such a favorable
                                   opinion that I expected when we made a reasonable request as to
                                   this bill, which is a vital one, and which is regarded as a
                                   political question, that they would permit us to at least print
                                   this bill and have it referred to a Committee for a short time,
                                   so that we would have an opportunity to bring in a minority
                                   report so that we could show its unfairness and inconslstencies.
                                   But that was denied us, and every proposition made by the
                                   minority was denied, and the bill was read the second time, and
                                   before the amendment could be offered, the Senator from Jasper
                                   moves to engross the bill and nothing else could be heard but a
                                   motion to engross the bill in order to put it, per adventure,
                                   beyond any amendment or criticism whatever. It indicated to me
                                   and for the first time I was suspicious that any measure at this
                                   special session was being put through under caucus rule, and
                                   moved by caucus despotism. Then I discovered that this bill was
                                   to be put through without any amendment. It comes up to-day,
                                   introduced last Friday, read the second time on Saturday, and now
                                   against every proposition made by the minority to refer it to a
                                   committee, to amend it, to print it or to consider any of its
                                   demerits, we are forced now, under the operations of the previons
                                   question to vote against the bill that disfranchises a large
                                   proportion of the citizens of Indiana.
                              In my judgment this bill is unconstitutional and will so be held by
                                   the courts; and I feel as I sit in my place, remaining there for
                                   the purpose of discharging my duties to the best of my ability,
                                   and opposed to the principle of resignation or bolting that I
                                   have the consolation that at an early day after this bill shall
                                   have passed, its constitutionality will be presented to and
                                   determined by the proper tribunals of the State, and by them held
                                   unconstitutional as it should be.
                              [Mr. G. was here interrupted, and the point of Order made that he
                                   was not in the line of explanation, but the President said:
                                   "I take it that the Senator is making the argument on
                                   that side and I will hear it."]
                              The constitutional provision that this law shall be passed, was to
                                   equally apportion the legal votes of the State of Indiana, and I
                                   call the attention of Senators respectfully to the fact that the
                                   present apportionment law, which was made several years ago, was
                                   so formed that we would have to carry the State by over 3,000
                                   majority in order to have a majority in the Legislature on joint
                                   ballot, and to-day I call attention to the fact, that while you
                                   carried the State in some respects, by a few votes, less than
                                   200, and on the general vote not to exceed 2,000, you have
                                   thirteen or fourteen majority in the General Assembly on joint
                                   ballot. I ask you in God's name if the present
                                   apportionment ain't sufficiently fair and reasonable to
                                   you, without asking us to aid you in so apportioning the State
                                   that we might carry the State by ten thousand, and yet you have a
                                   majority on joint ballots m the General Assembly. Therefore, I
                                   say, the inequality of this apportionment law is obnoxious to the
                                   Constitution and ought to be to every fair man in this
                                   Senate.
                              Why is it, I ask Senators, do they desire to so apportion the State
                                   that it will be impossible, almost, in the future, if this bill
                                   stands legal investigation, for a majority of voters, if they
                                   happen to be against you, to have a majority in the General
                                   Assembly? I was willing to concede to you, and so were all my
                                   political friends, what you are entitled to--what political
                                   parties usually claim, and it is due to you--that by this
                                   apportionment to arrange it so as to have a reasonable majority
                                   on joint ballot if you carried the State at all. As it is we may,
                                   under the present apportionment, carry the State and yet not have
                                   a majority in the General Assembly. Therefore, I thought the
                                   present law was sufficiently unfair three years ago, yet this is
                                   infinitely worse, and it is odious to us, and it ought to be
                                   odious to any fair minded or reasonable man on the other side of
                                   the chamber. It gives to Marion county--
                              The PRESIDENT pro tem., (interrupting). I beg leave to say to the
                                   Senator that I have already listened to him as long as the rules
                                   of propriety will allow. I hope the Senator will confine his
                                   remarks to a proper explanation of his vote. We are operating
                                   under the previous question and some law and some order should be
                                   observed. I have allowed him to wander outside of what is proper,
                                   and I trust he will confine himself to a proper explanation of
                                   his vote.
                              Mr. GLESSNER. I had no object but to give what I honestly and
                                   consciously beleive to be my reasons for voting against this bill. I did it
                                   believing it to be a duty. I had no object in delaying the final
                                   vote upon this bill. It is now to be voted upon. If I have
                                   resorted in the past to parliamentary delay for the purpose of
                                   defeating this class of legislation, I am not doing it now. I
                                   only intended to give what I believed was a fair statement of the
                                   present condition of the bill. We have had no opportunity to
                                   propose amendments or to discuss the bill on this side, not even
                                   an opportunity of bringing in a minority report. This, I say, has
                                   been unfair to us. I believe this bill is to be put through under
                                   a sort of despotism that the majority have decided upon outside
                                   of the Senate Chamber. I speak from experience of political
                                   parties.
                              I am sorry it is so; I am sorry you have not given us an
                                   opportunity; but you have done what perhaps you thought you had a
                                   right to do; at least perhaps you thought you were justified in
                                   doing so. But I don't think you are. I heard it remarked
                                   by some Republican Senator, either Friday or Saturday, that this
                                   was only a little measure of punishment for the majority two
                                   years ago, introducing an apportionment bill. That bill was not
                                   introduced in the last General Assembly under the direction of a
                                   caucus. My political friends know I was opposed to the
                                   introduction of an apportionment bill two years ago, and opposed
                                   to the bill then sought to be introduced. It may have been in one
                                   or two instances what may be considered bv the majority of
                                   Senators as unfair to them. I know in many respects it was unfair
                                   to the Democratic party. If they will take that apportionment
                                   bill and compare it with this they will see that it is nothing at
                                   all to compare with this.
                              The PRESIDENT pro tem. (interposing) The Chair must remind the
                                   Senator from Shelby that an explanation of a vote does not
                                   involve the right to argue the merits of a bill. If he persists
                                   in this longer the Chair will direct the clerk to call his name
                                   and then proceed to call other Senators.
                              Mr. GLESSNER. I could not give an explanation of my vote without
                                   alluding incidentally to the character of the bill. It will be
                                   impossible for me, I beg pardon of the Chair, to give my reasons
                                   without indicating wherein the bill is obnoxious to my views.
                                   With one more word I am done. I desire the Senate if it passes
                                   this bill to take up the bill introduced by the Senator from Knox
                                   (Mr. Williams), the bill introduced two years ago, and see the
                                   difference in the measures. I want you to see the merits of the
                                   bill that caused the Republican members two years ago to resign
                                   their seats--the difference in the merits and fairness between
                                   the bill now being passed and the one introduced two years
                                   ago.
                              Mr. GREGG said he would have done anything in the world to defeat
                                   this bill. He respected, loved and honored his people and he
                                   hardly knew how to explain his vote, because he felt there was a
                                   crisis pending over Dearborn county. This proposes to disfrancise
                                   them. The people of the county, without distinction of party, had
                                   sent him word to do everything in his power to defeat this bill.
                                   More than that, the bill is unconstitutional. In this connection
                                   he referred to the fifth section of the fourth article of the
                                   Constitution. Mr. Gregg paid an eloquent and glowing tribute to
                                   the heroism, bravery, intelligence and patriotism of the people
                                   of Dearborn couuty, and concluded as follows: "Pass the
                                   bill, then, Senators, if you will. Go home if you dare, to you
                                   constituents, and tell them that you, in behalf of your
                                   Republican districts, disfranchised Franklin and Dearborn
                                   counties--took from us our representation and applied it to
                                   yourselves. Tell your people you have done this sort of a thing,
                                   and I am willing for you to try it, for I believe, in conclusion
                                   in the Scripture doctrine that the "wages of sin is
                                   death," and that it will result not in your favor, but
                                   against your party and your party causes."
                              Mr. HARNEY said he found on an examination of the bill, taking the
                                   vote of the 8th of October last as a basis, the other House would
                                   have 60 Republicans and the opponents 40, and in the Senate we
                                   can elect 18 Democrats against 32 Republicans. He found further
                                   that under this apportionment the Democratic party had 4,714 for
                                   each Reprefentative, and the Republicans 3,147. In other words,
                                   six of one party was equal to nine of the other. An analysis
                                   showed that the Democrats might carry the State by 15,000, and
                                   still be in a minority in the Legislature and could not elect a
                                   United States Senator. He suggested that he didn't think
                                   that was fair. Each Republican would represent 7,157 votes and
                                   each Democrat 7,853, leaving 696 unrepresented. He could not
                                   support a bill which worked such injustice.
                              Mr. SLATER thought the presentation of this bill was an argument
                                   against the efficacy of prayer. Several ministers had appeared
                                   before the Senate and all had prayed devoutly that the
                                   legislation of the Senators on this floor should be just, and he
                                   thought no more odious measure had ever been presented than this,
                                   which in- dicated that the
                                   Lord had not heeded the prayers of His annointed.
                              Mr. STEELE, when his name was called, said: In explanation of my
                                   vote I want to say to the Senate that gentlemen on the other side
                                   are now complaining of us--even complaining that we are acting
                                   unjustly, when if gentlemen will remember two years ago nearly
                                   every important measure before the Senate that assumed a
                                   political aspect that same gag rule they speak was applied and
                                   the mouth of every Senator on this floor was stopped. They would
                                   not even allow a bill that they thought was likely to make
                                   against their party to be even read before the Senate, but the
                                   gag rule was applied to the bill itself. I see men complaining
                                   about unconstitutional action who at that time were rising in
                                   their places and voting that a Senator who had been brought here
                                   after having been sworn into office was not indeed a Senator, and
                                   they were ready to stop the mouth of every Senator who would
                                   speak in behalf of that Senator. These are the gentlemen who are
                                   complaining unconstitutional measures, and complaining at the
                                   same time that the gag rule has been adopted here. Great God
                                   Almighty!
                              Mr. HARNEY. May I be allowed to ask the gentleman a question?
                              The PRESIDENT pro tem. I cannot permit questions going back and
                                   forth. I say to the Senator from Grant (Mr. Steele) what I have
                                   said to other Senators during the explanations of their votes, to
                                   confine himself to giving the reasons for his vote.
                              Mr. STEELE. I will try. I was going to say, in explanation of my
                                   vote, that I do not think it comes with good grace from these
                                   familiar faces to say that I shall not apply the gag rule. I
                                   remember too well two years ago. I remember how I felt, and I
                                   remember of saying to gentlemen, chickens came home to roost
                                   sometimes; and now they can determine ther that is really
                                   true.
                              They talk about being disfranchised and we find some of our own
                                   friends saying that they have not got as much as they should
                                   have. They complain that this bill does not give them as much as
                                   they desire. While Senators on the other side complain that they
                                   have not as much as they should have. Occupying a position
                                   between the two we are nearly right in this matter I expect. It
                                   is hard to so apportion the State that everybody will be
                                   satisfied. We can make one or two districts that will satisfy
                                   ourselves, but when we attempt to satisfy everybody we always
                                   fail as we have in this instance. Those same Senators who are
                                   here to-day declared that they never will on any occasion vote
                                   for a matter they regard as unconstitution, two years ago--
                              Mr. SLATER (interrupting.) I rise to a point of order. The
                                   gentleman should confine himself to an explanation of his
                                   vote..
                              The PRESIDENT, pro tem. The point of order is a good one. But other
                                   Senators have gone on, and I suppose the Senator will not occupy
                                   much more time.
                              Mr. STEELE (continuing.) It was convenient then for those men to
                                   apportion the State for representative purposes, two years before
                                   the time the Constitution provided, and yet there was no prating
                                   about the constitutionality of their proposed action then, I
                                   heard no complaint of that sort from that side of the House.
                                   Then, in short, I will close by saying, I think this is a
                                   tolerable fair bill. I did not expect to suit our opponents,
                                   indeed we are not all suited ourselves. I vote
                                   "aye,"
                              Mr. WILLIAMS, when his name was called, said: If I can explain my
                                   vote without Senators getting irritated, I will do so. As I
                                   understand it, there is a right and a wrong way to make an
                                   apportionment. One is to take the census and apportion one
                                   Senator for every 7,600 white inhabitants. If that rule had been
                                   carried out I should not complain; but in comparing that bill
                                   with this ratio I find it applies to one side and not to the
                                   other. I have taken pains to examine this bill, and I see that
                                   districts likely to return Democrats require 7,990 for a Senator,
                                   and those districts that are sure to elect Republicans require
                                   but 7,352. For Reprrsentatives, I find that it requires in those
                                   counties that are Democratic, 4,566, while for Republican
                                   counties it requires but 3,390--a difference of 1,100 and upwards
                                   against the Democratic party. I find again, sir, that in 95
                                   districts that portion of the State represented by Republicans,
                                   it makes them, have an average 2,265 for each Senator arid
                                   Representative, while the Democrats having 55 require 3,888 for
                                   each district--a difference against the Democratic party of 623
                                   in every case. This is too much. This is not all accidental. This
                                   could not have been so without design. I know they could have
                                   made a bill nearer equal.
                              It is said that two years ago there was a very iniquitous
                                   apportionment bill introduced here. The only point of objection I
                                   ever heard to that bill was that it disfranchised Lake and Porter
                                   counties. With a population of 6,237, according to the census
                                   taken for that purpose, they have just 737 more than they ought
                                   to have for a Senator and
                                   one Representative, and 1,363 less than for a Senator and two
                                   Representatives. Now I leave gentlemen to say whether they ought
                                   to throw away the 1,300 or the 700. There is the whole bug-a-boo.
                                   I have taken some pains to note the discrepancies in the bill
                                   before the Senate. In Floyd and Scott, with 10,186 white males, I
                                   see they have one Senator and two Representatives. Miami and
                                   Howard has 8,458, and they get four Representatives. Brown and
                                   Bartholomew, with 6,515, get one Senator and one Representative.
                                   Fayette and Union, with 423, less than one-half, get a Senator
                                   and a Representative. In Laporte where they have 6,559, they get
                                   disfranchised by having a Senator and one Representative, but
                                   Lake and Porter mustn't be with some 300 less. It is all
                                   right to disfranchise Laporte, but wrong to disfranchise Lake
                                   arid Porter. They are taking care of these small counties.
                              I could add, perhaps, a great many other reasons why this bill
                                   should not pass, but I will say here that the bill of two years
                                   ago was a fair bill, and no Senator dare to argue against it. I
                                   had hoped on Saturday to offer some amendments to this bill, or
                                   at least to have an opportunity to discuss it without being
                                   interrupted every few minutes or being declared out of order, but
                                   in that I was mistaken, although it was said that there was going
                                   to be a vote taken but time would be given for discussion, and I
                                   supposed they spoke from the book.
                              Then Marion county is given two Senators and four Representatives,
                                   and not content with that, they must gobble up the Senator from
                                   Shelby; not content with that they must have a joint
                                   representative with Shelby. Is that right? Does the history of
                                   our State present anything to compare with that? And can any
                                   Senator show me that there ever was a bill passed to apportion
                                   the State for Senatorial, Representative or Congressional
                                   purposes without being first sent to a committee, or without a
                                   fair and free discussion? Never have I known of such a thing but
                                   once, and that was some nine years ago. I know some Senators on
                                   the other side feel sore over the passage of this bill. These he
                                   likened to an old gentleman in the "pocket" who
                                   talked in favor of Democracy but always voted the Republican
                                   ticket, and when taken to task about it said: "I guess I
                                   talk right but I expect I vote wrong." There are
                                   Senators here this day that feel that way and I know it.
                              The vote was then announced ad above recorded.
                              So the bill passed the Senate.
                              Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence moved to reconsider the vote by which the
                                   bill passed, and to lay that motion on the table.
                              The latter motion was agreed to.

                              Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence moved to reconsider the vote just taken,
                                   and to lay that motion on the table.

                              Mr. NEFF, from the Committee on Claims, returned
                                   the resolution on the subject of the Brevier Legislative Reports,

                                   reorganization of Courts in Johnson County.
                              They were referred to the Committee on the Organfzation of
                                        Courts.
                              And then the Senate adjourned till tomorrow at ten

                         HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                         
                              MONDAY, December 16, 1872.
                         
                         The House met at 2 o'clock P. M., pursuant to adjournment.
                         On motion of Mr. OFFUTT, the reading of the journal of Saturday was
                              dispensed with.
                         The SPEAKER announced the consideration of the special order, viz: Mr.
                              Edwards of Lawrence's bill [H. R. 96] to repeal the act to
                              authorize aid in the construction of railroads by county and townships
                              taking stock therein, etc.
                         Mr. WALKER. I move to postpone the further consideration of this bill
                              till the next regular session. I have no interest in it myself, nor
                              has my colleague, or the people of my county, one way or another. I
                              desire to have a little further light on the subject. I am not willing
                              just now to vote in favor of the repeal of the law to authorize
                              counties and townships to aid in the construction of railroads, while
                              I am satisfied that it ought to be further guarded and restricted. I
                              have had no talk with my people about it, and my colleague informs me
                              that he has no advice from them. I know of know necessity for urging
                              it. I can't see that delay will be hazardous to anybody. I
                              would prefer to be sufficiently advised to vote intelligently on the
                              subject.
                         Mr. BRANHAM hoped the motion would prevail, and was satisfied that the
                              House is not in possession of the facts necessary to an intelligent
                              action. It is a question of much more importance than it is likely
                              will be given to it, and there is no special danger in delay.
                         Mr. KING moved to lay the motion to postpone on the table, but he was
                              induced to withdraw the motion, for debate.
                         Messrs. Woodard, Crumpacker and Lenfesty merely concurred in the
                              foregoing remarks.
                         Mr. BRANHAM demanded the yeas and nays, which were ordered and
                              resulted--yeas, 64; nays, 18--as follows:
                         
                              
                                   
                                        Yeas--Messrs. Anderson, Baker, Barrett, Baxter, Blocher,
                                             Bowser, Branham, Broadus, Butterworth, Cauthorn, Clark,
                                             Claypool, Cline, Cobb, Cole, Cowgill, Crumpacker, Dial,
                                             Durham, Ellsworth, Glasgow, Glazebrook, Goble,
                                             Gronendyke, Hatch, Hedrick, Heller, Hollingsworth.

                                             Schmuck, Scott, Shutt, Spellman, Stanley, Tingley,
                                             Thompson, of Spencer, Troutman, Tulley, Walker, Wesner,
                                             Whitworth, Willard, Wilson, of Blackford, Woord,
                                             Woollen, Wynn--64.
                                        Nays--Messrs. Billingsley, Coffman, Edwards, of Lawrence,
                                             Furnas, Givan, Gregory, Henderson, Kimball, King, Lent,
                                             Offutt, Ogden, Pfrimmer, Shirley, Teeter, Thayer,
                                             Thompson, of Elkhart, Mr. Speaker--18.
                                   
                              
                         
                         So the bill was postponed.
                         
                              EMPLOYES OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY.
                              On motion of Mr. LENFESTY, the bill [S. 145] in relation to the
                                   organization of the two Houses of the General Assembly,
                                   prescribing the number of officers and employes of the two Houses
                                   of the General Assembly, and regulating their duties, was taken
                                   up and read.
                              Mr. WALKEK moved to dispense with the constitutional restrictions,
                                   that it may be read the second and third times and put upon its
                                   passage.
                              
                              The motion was agreed to, and the bill having been read the second
                                   time by title--
                              Mr. WALKER moved to amend by striking out that part which relates
                                   to the clerks of the standing committees of the Senate and
                                   House.
                              After debate by Messrs. BRANHAM, LENFESTY, HELLER and others, the
                                   amendment was adopted.
                              Mr. COLE proposed further to amend in section 2 by striking out
                                   "four," and inserting "five"
                                   in lieu--relating to the number of copying clerks in the
                                   House.
                              It was adopted--affirmative 47, negative 26.
                              The question being on the final passage of the bill--
                              Mr. BUTTERWORTH considered the number of doorkeepers
                                   insufficient.
                              Mr. OFFUTT obtained unanimous consent to introduce into these
                                   proceedings, in an informal way, the reports from the Clerks,
                                   Doorkeeper and Chairmen of the Standing Committees, as to the
                                   number of their employes, as required by his resolution of
                                   Saturday.
                              The Assistant Clerk reported 7 assistants; the Doorkeeper, 21
                                   employes; the Ways and Means Committee, 2
                                   clerks and 1 janitor; the Judiciary Committee,
                                   1 clerk and 1 janitor; the Committee on
                                        Education, 1 clerk, and the Committee on
                                        Claims, 1 clerk. There were also reported 10
                                   assitants to the Principal Clerk.
                              The total number as reported was 44, and the SPEAKER announced the
                                   total number of the employes of the House to be 56, as indicated
                                   by the pay warrants, and the discrepancy was explained. This was
                                   explained by the facts that warrants have been drawn under
                                   resolutions of the House to pay the services about the
                                   organization, etc.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN moved to amend further by striking out from the bill
                                   sections 7, 8, 9, 10,11, for the reason that these sections
                                   embrace precisely the matter of his bill [H. R. 119] which has
                                   passed both Houses--having just been returned from the Senate
                                   with clerical amendments of the title. His bill [H. R. 119]
                                   simply provides for the organization of the General Assembly and
                                   to that extent was precisely the same as the law of Ohio and
                                   Illinois. This bill which comes now from the Senate seems to make
                                   an exception in favor of the officers of this session of the
                                   General Assembly, to make it their duty to organize the next
                                   session. And if they come on and do the work they must be paid
                                   for it.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, said the provision that the President of the
                                   Senate and the Speaker of the House shall organize at the
                                   succeeding session could not involve expense, these officers
                                   being members of the General Assembly. He regarded this bill as a
                                   step in the right direction, and would avoid amendments that
                                   might not better it, and would certainly make delay.
                              Mr. MILLER. Instead of being a step in the right direction, it
                                   might prove to be overstepping it. As for the part proposed for
                                   the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of
                                   Representatives, he did not so much object to that, but as to
                                   clerks and police--a standing provision., could hardly stand
                                   long. He would stand by the Cauthorn bill.
                              Mr. OFFUTT. The bill of the gentleman frem Knox, provides simply
                                   for the organization, and this Senate bill comprehends that and
                                   provides for the running force of the General Assembly. There is
                                   no difficulty about re-enacting the same matter, because the last
                                   expression is the will of the General Assembly.
                              The amendment was adopted on a division--affirmative, 41; negative
                                   not reported.
                              Mr. KING proposed further to amend the bill by increasing the
                                   number of engrossing clerks for the principal clerk of the House
                                   from three to four.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN made an ineffectual motion to lay it on the table, and
                                   the amendment was finally adopted--yeas, 43; nays, 38.
                              The bill, as amended, was finally passed by the House--yeas, 77;
                                   nays 4--with an amendment of title, as required by Mr.
                                   Cauthorn's amendment, viz.: Striking out these words:
                                   "In relation to the organization of the two Houses of
                                   the General Assembly."
                              On motion of Mr. CAUTHORN, the House concurred in the Senate
                                   amendment to the title of this organization bill [H. R. 119]
                                   making it "an act," instead of a
                                   "bill."
                         
                         
                              SECOND JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.
                              On motion of Mr. RUDDER, the second Circuit Court bill [S. 118] was
                                   taken up and (the restrictions having been removed for the
                                   purpose) it was finally passed the House of Representatives
                                   without amendment.--Yeas, 78; nays, 3.
                         
                         
                              TIPPECANOE BATTLE GROUND.
                              On motion of Mr. COLE, the bill, [S. 45] to provide for the
                                   permanent enclosure of the Tippecanoe battle ground, was taken up
                                   and referred to the Committee on the Battle
                                        Ground.
                         
                         
                         
                              CALUMET FEEDER DAM.
                              The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Attorney
                                   General in relation to the Calumet feeder dam, which was referred
                                   to a special committee, to wit: Messrs. Wood, Coffman and
                                   Crumpacker.
                         
                         
                              COMMON SCHOOLS.
                              Mr. MELLETT obtained unanimous consent to return from the
                                        Committee on Education his bill [H. R.
                                   55] to amend the common school law, which he did, reporting
                                   sundry amendments thereto, which were adopted.
                              On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the bill, as amended, was laid on the
                                   table, and it was ordered that 200 copies be printed.
                         
                         
                              INDIANA UNIVERSITY.
                              Mr. HATCH, by leave, introduced a bill [H. R. 255] supplemental to
                                   the act for the relief of the Indiana University, and increasing
                                   and extending its benefits by providing for the sale of the
                                   unsold University lands donated by the Congress of the United
                                   States.
                         
                         
                              THE JUDICIARY.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill [H. R.
                                   256] to regulate the order of business in the Circuit and Common
                                   Pleas Courts; to authorize Judges to make orders for the the time
                                   of forming issues, etc.
                              On motion of Mr. EDWARDS, of Lawrence, the bill [S. 134] was taken
                                   up and referred to the Committee on the Organization of
                                        Courts.
                              A message was received from the Senate, announcing the passage in
                                   that body of the mileage and per diem bill [H. R. 73] with a
                                   clerical amendment of title, and it was taken up and concurred
                                   in.
                              The House then adjourned.

                         INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
                         
                         IN SENATE.
                         
                              TUESDAY, December 17, 1872.
                         
                         The Senate met pursuant to adjourment, President Friedley in the chair.
                              Prayers were offered by the Rev. W. F. Harned, Presiding Elder of the
                              M. E. Church.
                         Mr. WILLIAMS moved to amend the journal by inserting his motion of
                              yesterday afternoon, when the bill to redistrict the State for
                              Senatorial and Representative purposes was on the third reading.
                         He claimed that he moved to recommit the legislative apportionment bill
                              to a committee of one from each Congressional District, with
                              instructions to strike out all after the enacting clause and
                              substitute anew bill. The journal did not contain the last clause of
                              the motion, and he moved that it be corrected accordingly.
                         Mr. BROWN moved as a substitute that the journal be corrected so as to
                              read that Mr. Williams moved to recommit the bill "with
                              instructions," without specifying what the instructions
                              were.
                         Mr. WILLIAMS moved ineffectually to lay the amendment on the table--yeas
                              27, nays 12.
                         Mr. CARNAHAN stated, when his name was called, that he knew Mr.
                              Williams' statement to be perfectly correct.
                         Mr. ORR also heard the motion to recommit, but had no recollection of
                              the offering of a substitute, and therefore he should vote
                              "no."
                         Mr. SCOTT also explained his vote. He would like to know what paper
                              accompanied the motion.
                         Mr. WADGE remembered distinctly the facts as stated by Mr. Williams.
                         Mr. BROWN offered another substitute, that Mr. Williams moved to
                              recommit with instructions, and stating his reason as President pro
                              tem. for ruling it out of order--the Senate having ordered the main
                              question--acting under the operation of the previous question.
                         Mr. WILLIAMS insisted on his statement as first sent up, and if voted
                              down it would only be adding insult to injury. He moved to lay the
                              substitute on the table.
                         This motion was rejected by yeas 29, nays 20.
                         The substitute was then adopted and the PRESIDENT ordered the journal so
                              corrected.
                         Mr. GLESSNER moved to further amend the journal by a inserting a
                              statement that on the motion of Mr. Williams to lay Mr.
                              Dwiggins' motion to take up the bill, [S. 46] the yeas and
                              nays being called for, before the Secretary proceeded to call the roll
                              Mr. Glessner asked to be excused from voting, which motion to be
                              excused was by the chair declared out of order; thereupon Mr. Glessner
                              appealed from the decision of the chair, and asked leave to send up
                              his appeal, which was disregarded, and the Secretary directed to
                              proceed with the roll call.
                         Mr. DWIGGINS made an ineffectual motion to lay this motion on the
                              table--yeas 13; nays, 22.
                         Mr. GOODING explained his vote by saying his recollection was with the
                              mover.
                         
                         Mr. HAWORTH obtained an exemption from voting.
                         Mr. O'BRIEN'S recollection was not in accord with the
                              proposed amendment.
                         Mr. ORR recollected the motion as stated.
                         Mr. SLEETH thought the statement partly correct and partly
                              incorrect.
                         Mr. BROWN offered a substitute, reciting that pending a motion by Mr.
                              Williams to lay Mr. Dwiggins' motion to take up the bill [S.
                              146] on the table, and to consider it engrossed and read the third
                              time and put upon its passage, and that the presiding officer had
                              directed the Secretary to proceed with the roll call, when Senator
                              Glessner exclaimed that he desired to be excused from voting, but
                              Senator Glessner was not recognized by the Chair, saying such a motion
                              was out of order, when Senator Glessner exclaimed he would appeal from
                              the decision of the chair, and Senator Glessner did not put his appeal
                              in writing.
                         Mr. BROWN supported his motion by reference to past experience in such
                              resorts to legislative trickery, as was attempted by the Senator from
                              Shelby (Mr. Glessner.) He said he thought he could see through the
                              efforts of the gentlemen to secure these amendments to the journal. It
                              had been given out on the floor of the Senate that this bill would be
                              taken before the courts, and the gentlemen were now trying to
                              manufacture evidence to be used before the courts. He called attention
                              to the fact that Mr. Glessner's amendment did not recite Mr.
                              Dwiggin's motion correctly, and said a deliberate effort was
                              being made to garble the records.
                         Mr. DWIGGINS said that Mr. Glessner's request to be excused and
                              his appeal were not made until the Secretary had commenced to call the
                              roll, and he was clearly out of order. This being the case, he did not
                              see why the journal should be cumbered with the record of these
                              proceedings.
                         Mr. STEELE made the point that a request from the Senator from Shelby to
                              be excused from voting was not in order until his name was called.
                         Mr. BEESON moved to lay the whole subject on the table.
                         Mr. GLESSNER appealed in vain to the Senator to withdraw the motion, and
                              give him an opportunity of replying to the three Senators who had
                              spoken against his amendment.
                         The motion to lay on the table was agreed to by yeas 26 to nays 19.
                         The PRESIDENT said if there are no other corrections of the journal it
                              will stand approved.
                         
                              CALUMET DAM.
                              He also laid before the Senate a communication from the Attorney
                                   General, transmitting a statement concerning the present
                                   condition of the Calumet dam at Blue Island, in the State of
                                   Illinois.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved that reading of this somewhat lengthy
                                   communication be dispensed with and that it be referred to a
                                   select committee of three.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              The PRESIDENT subsequently made this committee to consist of
                                   Messrs. Wadge, Hubbard and Winterbotham.
                              On motion by Mr. HAWORTH the order of business was dispensed with,
                                   and the Senate agreed to consider the court bill [H. R. 172.]
                              And then came the recess.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The Senate met at 2 o'clock.
                         
                         
                              COURT BILLS.
                              The bill pending at the time of the recess [H. R. 172] to fix the
                                   time of the Common Pleas Courts in the Sixth Judicial District,
                                   affecting the counties of Franklin, Union, Fayette, Wayne, was
                                   read the first time.
                              On motion of Mr. GOODING the bill [R. H. 257] to amend section 3 of
                                   the act districting the State for judicial circuits, approved
                                   June 17, 1852, so that Knowx, Daviess, Martin, Gibson, Vanderburg
                                   and Posey shall constitute the Third Judicial Circuit, was read
                                   the first time.
                              He moved for a dispensation of the Constitutional restriction, that
                                   the bill may be pressed to its final passage now.
                              The motion was agreed to by yeas 35, nays 0.
                              It was read the second time and passed by yeas 40, nays 1.
                              On motion of Mr. GOODING, the bill [H. R. 258] to amend the first
                                   section of an act to create the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit out of
                                   the counties of Warrick, Spencer, Perry, Crawford, Dubois and
                                   Pike, was read the first time.
                              Mr. GOODING moved to further suspend the rules that the bill may be
                                   pushed to its final reading.
                              This motion was laid on the table.
                         
                         
                              TAX ASSESSMENTS.
                              Mr. STEELE, from the Committee on Finance,
                                   returned the bill [H. R. 163] to provide for a uniform assessment
                                   of property, and for the collection and return of taxes thereon,
                                   which took its place on the files after the report was concurred
                                   in.
                         
                         
                         
                              PETITIONS.
                              Mr. BROWN presented petitions from citizens of Shelby county,
                                   praying against the passage of a bill before this General
                                   Assembly legalizing certain assessment acts of gravel road
                                   companies, which were referred to the Committee on
                                        Corporations.
                              Mr. STEELE moded to suspend the order of business that the bill [H.
                                   R. 163] for the assessment and collection of taxes, just returned
                                   from the Finance Committee, may be read the
                                   third time and put on its passage.
                         
                         
                              JUDGES' SALARIES.
                              Mr. GLESSNER called up the special order for the hour, being the
                                   bill to fix the salaries of Judges of the courts of the
                                   State.
                              A motion to make the bill the special order for Friday at two
                                   o'clock was agreed to.
                         
                         
                              TAX ASSESSMENTS.
                              The Senate then returned to the consideration of the bill [H. R.
                                   163] to provide for the valuation of real and personal property
                                   for taxation.
                              Mr. NEFF moved to amend so as to provide that the shares of capital
                                   stock of banks shall be taxed at its cash value.
                              Mr. STEELE said the amendment was unnecessary, as the bill provides
                                   that all personal property shall be taxed at its fair, cash
                                   value.
                              Mr. NEFFsaid if the word "fair" was struck out he
                                   would be satisfied.
                              Mr. BROWN proposed to strike out the word
                                   "fair."
                              Mr. SLEETH said the section to which the amendment of Mr. Neff
                                   applied simply provided that the shares of bank stock shoudl be
                                   taxed at the same rate as other personal property, and no
                                   more.
                              Mr. NEFF withdrew his amendment.
                              On motion of Mr. DWIGGINS, the bill was read the third time and
                                   passed by yeas 36, nays 7.
                              Pending the roll call--
                              Mr. GREGG, in explanation of his vote, said he could not support
                                   the bill. First, because he did not understand it. More than
                                   that, he did not believe the operation of the bill upon National
                                   Banks would be salutary, and thought the effect of the bill would
                                   be to raise the value of real estate. Still further, he did not
                                   believe in the establishment of a State Board of Equalization as
                                   provided for by the bill. He stated that National Banks cannot
                                   escape taxation if the county auditor does his duty, under the
                                   present laws, and he was surprised to hear that only one bank in
                                   the city of Indianapolis was paying taxes on its capital
                                   stock.
                              This bill should have the consideration that belongs to a subject
                                   of so much importance. The Legislature of Illinois were more than
                                   three weeks considering a bill of this kind. He apprehended some
                                   danger under this bill--that it will operate so as to put bank
                                   stock on the tax duplicate at a lower rate than under the present
                                   law. He would not vote that the taxes of the farmer be increased
                                   by shipping the burden of taxation from personal property and
                                   molded capital, and throwing more on real estate or upon
                                   commerce. Admitting that there wrere some valuable provisions in
                                   the bill, he could not consent to vote for it with these
                                   objections to it.
                              Mr. HARNEY, when his name was called, said this bill had one merit,
                                   at least, that it was consistent throughout; it created a system
                                   founded on the new order of things. The taxes were to be levied
                                   equally on all property at its fair valuation on a voluntary
                                   sale. Under the old law, the valuation was made at what the
                                   property would bring on a forced sale. The new system was
                                   certainiy the better. The bill also provides that the assessment
                                   shall be made on the 1st of April instead of January, so that the
                                   farmer would be relieved of taxes on the products consumed during
                                   the winter and early spring. He thought the bill was a decided
                                   improvement on the old system, and although it might not be
                                   perfect, it was worth passing, and could be perfected hereafter.
                                   He thought the plan would work well, and the only way to test it
                                   is to put it in operation. No doubt provisions will be found in
                                   it that will not prove effective. Human wisdom cannot make a bill
                                   perfect. Because it is a system is a good reason for trying this
                                   bill now. Human wisdom could hardly enact a worse system than we
                                   have lived under for some time past.
                              Mr. NEFF, in explanation of his vote, said: I confess in the vote I
                                   shall give I am not satisfied that it will be right. I was not
                                   aware till this afternoon that copies had been laid on the desks
                                   of Senators or I certainly should have improved the opportunity
                                   of acquainting myself with the provisions of the bill. I have but
                                   little doubt from the glance I have given it since it came up but
                                   that there are some good provisions in it, but there are other
                                   provisions I have doubts about the propriety of adopting. Having
                                   conversed with Governor Baker and some Senators who have examined
                                   the bill, I shall vote "aye," believing it is
                                   right, and if it should prove to be wrong we can remedy the evils
                                   during the next session. We
                                   can examine the bill between this and the next session, and
                                   perfect it by a supplemental bill. I vote
                                   "aye."
                              Mr. ORR, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said
                                   this bill is a complicated bill. Not being able to examine it as
                                   I should like to, but having confidence in the statements of
                                   Senators who have examined it, under the circumstances I shall
                                   vote "aye."
                              Mr. SLEETH, in explaining his vote, said: There is one provision in
                                   this bill I believe will be stricken down by the courts. That is
                                   the clause authorizing corporations to tax the National Banks and
                                   the branches of the Bank of the State of Indiana. If that clause
                                   can be enforced, I am in favor of it. Notwithstanding I believe
                                   the bill is imperfect I shall vote "aye."
                              Mr. GLESSNER, when the roll call was completed, said: Having
                                   learned that there is a provision in the bill fixing the
                                   valuation of real estate the same as personal property, and
                                   believing that would be unfair to the agricultural portion of the
                                   community, I was induced to vote against the bill; but learning
                                   of another provision in it of as much importance as that, which I
                                   favor, I desire to change my vote, and vote
                                   "aye."
                              The result was then announced as above.
                              So the bill was finally passed.
                         
                         
                              TOWNSHIP TRUSTEES.
                              On motion by Mr, DAGGY, the bill [H. R. 227] providing for the
                                   payment to township trustees of all moneys collected for specific
                                   purposes, except such as may be collected for State and county
                                   revenue, was read the first time.
                              And then the Senate adjourned till to-morrow at 10
                                   o'clock.
                         
                         
                    
                    
                    
                         THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                         
                         THIRTEENTH VOLUME.
                         
                         INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
                         
                         HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                         
                              TUESDAY, December 17, 1872.
                         
                         The SPEAKER directed the reading of the journal of yesterday.
                         On motion of Mr. TULLEY, the reading was dispensed with.
                         A message was received from the Senate announcing the passage and
                              signing of sundry bills.
                         
                              TIPPECANOE BATTLE GROUND.
                              Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH obtained unanimous consent to submit a report
                                   from the Special Committee on the Tippecanoe Battle
                                        Ground, returning the bill [S. 45] providing for
                                   the permanent enclosure of the Tippecanoe Battle Ground,
                                   recommending its passage. (The bill appropriates for the purpose
                                   $24,000 to enclose the grounds--8 1/3 acres--with an iron fence.)
                                   The report contains a statement of State's acquisition
                                   of these grounds, their treatment since, together with Mr.
                                   Talbot's estimate of the cost of their improvement.
                              Mr. WOODARD moved for a suspension of the Constitutional
                                   restrictions, which was agreed to--yeas, 59; nays, 17--and the
                                   bill was read twice, and advanced to the final passage, and it
                                   was finally passed the House of Representatives.--Yeas, 71; nays,
                                   11,
                         
                         
                              THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY said the session was drawing to a close, and as yet no
                                   sufficient action had been taken by the General Assembly looking
                                   to the revision of the judicial system, as recommended by the
                                   Governor in his special message. He therefore moved to take up
                                   Mr. Woollen's concurrent resolution providing for
                                   raising a joint committee of six members of the House of
                                   Representatives and three on the part of the Senate, to sit
                                   during the recess and revise the indicia! districts, with a view
                                   to equalizing them. Mr. S said some of the Judges were working
                                   only six months, while others were working eight, and still
                                   others ten, and by this means justice was often delayed. If the
                                   circuits could be equalized justice could be speedily
                                   administered, with diminished expense. He thought the salaries of
                                   all the judges should be raised, but was opposed to considering
                                   any measure for such increase until the districts and the labors
                                   of the Judges had been equalized. He felt confident that this
                                   joint committee will find that we have enough Judges already, and
                                   that we ought to increase their salaries. Five thousand dollars
                                   would be little enough for the Supreme Court, $3,000 for the
                                   Circuit, and $2,500 for the Common Pleas Judges. In quite a
                                   number of the Circuits and Districts the Judges are working only
                                   about six months in the year, and if we increase their salaries
                                   they should work at least ten months of the year. With the
                                   present compensation there is no lawyer who can take a judgeship
                                   without pecuniary sacrifice. We can't expect to get
                                   adequate talent without adequate compensation. This is matter
                                   that requires our attention as much as anything else. I wish to
                                   say, further, that I desire to adopt into our judicial system a
                                   rule to give the judges power to appoint trial terms and issue
                                   terms. It will save the time
                                   of the jurors and witnesses, by excusing them from the necessity
                                   of hanging about the court houses.
                              Objection being made to taking up the concurrent resolution, the
                                   motion was not entertained.
                         
                         
                              THIRD JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.
                              Mr. WOLFLIN asked and obtained unanimous consent to introduce a
                                   bill [H. R. 257] to amend section 3 of the act of June 17, 1852,
                                   to provide for redistricting the State for judicial purposes. [It
                                   proposes to regulate the terms in the third circuit, composed of
                                   the counties of Knox, Daviess, Martin, Gibson, Vanderburgh and
                                   Posey.]
                              Mr. CAUTHORN moved to dispense with the constitutional
                                   restrictions, which was agreed to.
                              Mr. PEED opposed some local considerations to the passage of the
                                   bill, and Mr. WOLFLIN and Mr. CAUTHORN spoke in favor of the bill
                                   as especially desired by the bar and the people of
                                   Vanderburg.
                              The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas 80,
                                   nays 0.
                         
                         
                              FIFTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.
                              Mr. WOLFLIN also introduced a bill [H. R. 258] to amend the first
                                   section of the act to create the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit,
                                   approved February 22, 1859--[the district to include Spencer,
                                   Perry, Dubois, Pike, Warrick and Crawford.]
                              Mr. HEDRICK moved ineffectually to lay the bill on the table.
                              Mr. PEED opposed the bill as he had the other, and for similar
                                   reasons--legislating a Judge out of one circuit into another.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN supported the bill as supplementing the provisions of
                                   the bill , [H. R. 257] just passed the House. It was necessary to
                                   Vanderburg county and to enable the Judge living up in Spencer
                                   county to reach court by railroad. And then, the restrictions
                                   having been suspended for the purpose, the bill was finally
                                   passed the House of Representatives--yeas 76, nays 6.
                         
                         
                              WAYS AND MEANS REPORTS.
                              Mr. KIMBALL, from the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means, reported a bill [H. R. 259] making specific
                                   appropriations for the years 1871 and 1872, which was read and
                                   ordered to the second reading.
                              On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, it was referred to the Committee
                                        on Ways and Means, with notice to all persons
                                   entitled to present their claims for place in the bill.
                              Mr. KIMBALL also returned Mr Billingsley's bill [H. R.
                                   122] providing for appraisement of real estate in all cities of
                                   30,000 inhabitants and more, and providing for compensation, and
                                   prescribing duties of county auditors therein, recommending its
                                   passage.
                              It was ordered to be engrossed.
                              Mr. KIMBALL also returned Mr. Mellett's bill [H. R. 54] to
                                   amend the act to secure a just valuation and assessment of
                                   railroad property, recommending that it be laid on the table.
                              The report was concurred in.
                         
                         
                              ATORNEY GENERAL.
                              The SPEAKER announced the consideration on the third reading of Mr.
                                   Riggs' bill [H. R. 113] to amend section two of the act
                                   to amend sections four and seven of the act providing for the
                                   election, etc. of the Attorney General; shall receive a salary of
                                   $3,000 per annum and a $10 docket fee taxed against the adverse
                                   party.
                              The bill was finally past the House of Representatives--yeas, 69;
                                   nays, 0.
                         
                         
                              RESTORED TO THE CALENDAR.
                              On motion by Mr. GIVAN, Mr Ellsworth's bill [H. R. 59] was
                                   restored to the calendar.

                                   which failed for want of a constitutional majority was restored
                                   to the calendar.
                              On motion of Mr. SATTERWHITE, Mr. Riggs' bill [H. R. 198]
                                   was also restored to the Clerk's files.
                         
                         
                              INTEREST ON SCHOOL FUND.
                              The SPEAKER took up the consideration on the third reading of Mr.
                                   Lenfesty's bill to render uniform the rate of interest

                              The SPEAKER took up the consideration of Mr. Edwards of
                                   Vigo's bill [H. R. 148] to define certain felonies and
                                   providing punishment therefor, compelling testimony of parties
                                   engaged therein against others than themselves (declaring it a
                                   felony, and punishing it accordingly, for any public officer
                                   letting a contract to receive any per centage, drawback or reward
                                   of bribery thereon, declaring all such contracts void, etc.); and
                                   it was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas 87, nays
                                   3.
                         
                         
                              TOWNSHIP TREASURIES.
                              The SPEAKER announced the consideration of the third reading of Mr.

                                   purposes, etc., approved March 11, 1867.
                              Mr. NORTH said it provides that persons living outside of town or
                                   city availing themselves of the city or town common schools,
                                   shall be taxed therein for school purposes.
                              It was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas 65, nays
                                   6.
                              Mr. Riggs' court bill [H. R. 223] being superceded, was
                                   laid on the table.

                                   which had once failed, on the third reading for want of the
                                   constitutional majority, was again submitted to the vote.
                              Mr. WOLFLIN said it was to admit of salary to the officers of
                                   savings banks doing a business of $250,000, etc.

                                   section two of the act concerning the organization and perpetuity
                                   of voluntary associations, and repealing, etc., coming up on the
                                   third reading.
                              Mr. OGDEN stated that it is a copy of the bill [S. 40] and on his
                                   motion it was laid on the table, and the bill [S. 40] with
                                   similar title and provisions was taken up. He said this bill
                                   admits of the organization of companies for the safe deposit and
                                   loaning of money. And on his further motion the constitutional
                                   restriction was suspended and the bill was advanced to the third
                                   reading.
                              Mr. WALKER said this bill also proposed to amend the laws so as to
                                   allow the organization of institutions for the medical treatment
                                   of the diseases of women.
                              Mr. MILLER feared that the provision for the organization of loan
                                   companies might admit of a system of free banking in Indiana, and
                                   that he was opposed to.
                              Mr. OGDEN assured the House that it was simply a provision to admit
                                   foreign capitalists to loan money through established agencies in
                                   the State. It was the opinion of the committee that it might make
                                   money easier. The bill admitted these companies to receive
                                   valuables on special deposit, making the incorporators
                                   responsible to the depositors. The bill was finaliy passed by the
                                   House of Representatives, yeas 75, nays 2.
                         
                         
                              FIRST JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley's First Judicial Circuit bill [H. R.
                                   177] embracing the counties of Ripley, Jennings, Jefferson and
                                   Switzerland, was taken up on the third reading.
                              Mr. WILSON said it was for the accommodation of the judge and
                                   parties--changing the time in Switzerland court.
                              It was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas, 80; nays,
                                   0.
                         
                         
                              INDIANA UNIVERSITY.
                              Mr. FURNAS' bill [H. R. 56] to appropriate $20,000
                                   annually towards the endowment of Indiana University was taken up
                                   on the third reading, and after sundry propositions to reduce the
                                   amount of the appropriation, and when the bill had failed on the
                                   trial vote, on motion of Mr. Branham the vote was reconsidered,
                                   and the bill was referred again to the Committee on
                                        Education, with instructions to amend by reducing
                                   the amount to $15,000.
                              The House then took a recess till two o'clock p. m.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The House assembled at two o'clock.
                         
                         
                         
                              PROFESSIONAL JURYMEN.
                              The SPEAKER announced the consideration of Mr. Givan's
                                   bill [H. R. 171] prescribing for the manner of selecting petit
                                   jurors for the Circuit and Common Pleas Courts, it being on the
                                   third reading. [The bill provides that when the jurors are drawn
                                   there shall be drawn also twelve contingents, from which list any
                                   vacancies shall be filled, and that no bystander shall be called
                                   until the list of contingents is exhausted.]
                              Mr. GIVAN. The object is to secure jurors from the reputable common
                                   people for the courts and to prevent the services of what are
                                   called professional jurors. [It requires the Auditor, Treasurer
                                   and Recorder to deposit 100 names in a box before the term, and
                                   requires the clerk to issue process to the sheriff to summon the
                                   first twelve the clerk draws from the box--not to summons the
                                   contingents--the second drawing--till the first day of the term;
                                   then he shall give to him the twelve contingents--the second
                                   drawing--to supply the place of those of the first drewing who
                                   shall fail to appear.
                              The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas 78;
                                   nays 0.
                         
                         
                              LABORERS' LIEN.
                              Mr. MILLER obtained leave to return Mr. Claypool's [H. R.
                                   241] to secure the rights of laborers on railroads, etc., by
                                   lien; and--
                              On motion of Mr. CLA YPOOL, the restrictions being suspended for
                                   the purpose--
                              The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas 88;
                                   nays 0.
                         
                         
                              APPORTIONMENT FOR REPRESENTATION.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN obtained leave to introduce a bill [H. R. 260] to fix
                                   the number of Senators and Representatives for the State of
                                   Indiana, and to apportion the gome among the several counties,
                                   and he asked that it lie on the table for the present. And it was
                                   so ordered by unanimous consent.
                              On motion of Mr. CAUTHORN, (on a division, affirmative, 50,
                                   negative, 46) the House took up the consideration of the
                                   apportionment bill [S. 136], and it was read the first time
                              Mr. CAUTHORN now moved that this bill and his bill [H. R. 260] be
                                   referred to the Committee on Elections.
                              Mr. WALKER had no objection that the gentleman's bill
                                   should take any course that he desires. I should prefer that the
                                   bill from the Senate lie over and take its regular place on the
                                   calendar.
                              Mr. BRANHAM hoped the House would consent to the printing of this
                                   bill. There can be no urgency for passing it at this session, and
                                   its importance demands a careful examination. And I hope that
                                   this House can't afford to make an unfair apportionment,
                                   which might be done if we were to pass this without due
                                   consideration. I move to lay the Senate bill on the table, and
                                   that both the Senate bill and that of the gentleman from Knox
                                   (Mr. Cauthorn) be printed.
                              The motion was agreed to, and the printing was ordered. But Messrs.
                                   Walker and Woolfin insisted that they had demanded the yeas and
                                   nays in time to save them under the rules; and accordingly they
                                   were taken resulting--yeas 55; nays 40; as follows:

                              So the motion prevailed, and it was ordered that the bill be laid
                                   on the table, and that both be printed.
                         
                         
                              LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
                              On motion of Mr. WALKER, Mr. Offutt was accorded indefinite leave
                                   of absence, he having received a dispatch informing him of
                                   sickness at home.
                         
                         
                              JAMES. F. DILL.
                              Mr. WOODARD submitted a preamble and resolution, reciting the
                                   employment of James F. Dill by the Dookeeper, under an order of
                                   the House, and ordering that the proper warrant be drawn for his
                                   pay.
                              Mr. BARRETT submitted remarks for the passage of the resolution,
                                   and it was adopted.
                              The SPEAKER said the warrant would have been drawn, but the record
                                   of the resolution was never made, and the doorkeeper never
                                   reported the employe, and this accounts for the number of
                                   warrants exceeding the reported number of employes--it is because
                                   the House passes these resolutions.

                                   returned Mr. Furnas' Indiana University (20,000)
                                   appropriation bill [H. R. 56] with the amendment directed by the
                                   House, striking out $20,000 and inserting $15,000 in lieu, and so
                                   amended, the committee recommended the passage of the bill.
                              The amendment was adopted and the bill was finally passed the House
                                   of Representatives--yeas 60, nays 35.

                                   returned the bill [S. 134] to fix the courts in the Twenty-sixth
                                   Judicial District for the Common Pleas Court.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY, with Mr. CLAYPOOL, as the minorty of said committee,
                                   recommended that the bill be indefinitely postponed for the
                                   reason that Judge Emerson has twenty-two weeks and Judge Coffman
                                   nineteen. The question being on concurring in the report of the
                                   minorty, debate followed--Messrs. Shirley, Woollen, Barrett and
                                   Offutt for the minority report, and Messrs. Wilson, of Ripley,
                                   Satterwhite, Cowgill and Edwards, of Lawrence, against it--till
                                   Mr. Satterwhite demanded the previous question, which was
                                   seconded by the House, and under its pressure the minority report
                                   was concurred in, and substituted for that of the majority of the
                                   committee. The report as thus substituted or amended was
                                   concurred in--yeas 49, nays 44--and so the bill was indefinitely
                                   postponed.
                         
                         
                              MECHANICS' LIEN.
                              Mr. LENFESTY'S bill [H. R. 136] to amend section 647 of
                                   the Practice Act of June 18, 1852, was taken up on the third
                                   reading.
                              Mr. L. said this bill becomes necessary under a recent decision of
                                   the Supreme Court, in which the Court takes a view a little
                                   different from that intended by the Legislature. The bill
                                   provides that, in order to make the party liable under the
                                   mechanics' lien law, he shall have notice; otherwise,
                                   the man might have to pay for his work more than once.
                              The bill finally passed the House of Representatives, yeas 93, nays
                                   0.
                         
                         
                              APPORTIONMENT FOR REPRESENTATION.
                              Mr. TROUTMAN submitted a motion to reconsider the vote of the
                                   afternoon by which it was ordered that the two apportionment
                                   bills--that from the Senate and Mr. Cauthorn's--were
                                   laid on the table and ordered to be printed.
                              Mr. BRANHAM hoped the motion would not prevail. He could see no
                                   possibly necessity for it. It is nothing more than what is due to
                                   the House that the vote should remain as it is. There is no good
                                   reason for such undue haste in a matter of this sort. It is one
                                   of the highest prerogatives of government--this act of
                                   apportionment for representation. It lies at the very foundation
                                   of government, and you cannot lightly say that one person in the
                                   State is not entitled to as much representation as another. I do
                                   not ask of this House anything but what is clearly right; and it
                                   is not right when you ask me to record my vote for a bill without
                                   the opportunity of seeing whether it is right or not. When did
                                   this bill come here? Why do you strike at the dearest rights of
                                   the people, and say, because a portion of them differ with you in
                                   politics, you will disfranchise them? I tell the majority here
                                   that they can't afford to take such action--and if they
                                   do, they will not hold their majority long. If we make an
                                   apportionment here it ought to be so made that we can sustain it
                                   before the people. It is but a mockery of representation to
                                   attach one county to another in the same district when you know
                                   that it will overwhelm and stifle the voice, of the people. Four
                                   years ago I happened to be on this floor when a secret outside
                                   influence obtained the passage of a corrupt apportionment bill;
                                   and I said then that no power of man should ever force upon me an
                                   unjust apportionment I take the ground that the majority here
                                   ought to give to the other side and to themselves a fair chance
                                   to examine this bill.
                              I have been told by a gentleman of the other branch of this body
                                   that is was an infamous bill--one that ought not to pass. Then
                                   let us have it printed. Who is the author of this bill? From
                                   whence does it come? Why should it come in here and be parsed
                                   under the threat of partizan excommunication ? Thank God, such
                                   threats have no terrors for me. Let us give to the people, as
                                   near as may be, a fair apportionment. I am well aware of the
                                   difficulties to be met with in adjusting these matters. There are
                                   not only public difficulties as to what should be the complexion
                                   of such an act, but in spite of us there will come in those
                                   numerous private interests. And let me tell gentlemen that those
                                   private interests were at the very bottom of this bill, and not
                                   the public good. So far as my county is concerned, I have nothing
                                   to say with regard to its provisions. But no man can look over it without observing some
                                   glaring defects which ought to be removed. And what have we to
                                   fear? Gentlemen have got up a bugbear about the breaking up of
                                   this session; but I tell gentlemen that if this session is to be
                                   broken up, it will be done by the tyranical act of the majority.
                                   Suppose the minority to bolt upon say the Congressional
                                   apportionment bill? Does any man here propose to vote for a bill
                                   that will not give to one-half the people of the State four
                                   members of Congress? Let gentlemen change sides for a moment; how
                                   would you like it if such a bill were to be forced upon you?
                                   Every impulse of a manly heart would be to rebel against such a
                                   thfng.
                              But do you say if we pass no apportionment bill our party will be
                                   endangered? How much better do you propose to make the
                                   apportionment than it is at present? But gentlemen say if this
                                   bill goes over to the regular session there will be the devil to
                                   pay. [Laughter.] Well, I am willing to settle with the old
                                   gentleman. There are none of us but must heartily approve of the
                                   spirit that has prevaded this session so far. For twenty years I
                                   have had the pleasure, sometimes as a member and sometimes in the
                                   lobby, of witnessing the proceedings of this body, and there has
                                   not been a session in all that time where the members generally
                                   have gone into the work of the State with more intelligence and
                                   zeal than they have at this session. I do not ask for this bill
                                   to go over to the next session, but only for a chance to examine
                                   it. I will tell gentlemen how I would make an apportionment bill.
                                   I would make the districts as nearly equal as possible; but in
                                   any case wherethere might be a doubt I would give as a reason my
                                   political friends the benefit of the doubt. But some gentlemen
                                   give as a reason for urging this doubt, that if you will let it
                                   go over to the regular session the Governor will veto it. But
                                   that cannot be the true reason; for gentlemen know if the
                                   Governor does veto it, that fifty-one votes will still pass the
                                   bill. No; there are other reasons for this urgency--some secret
                                   reason, perhaps, which I do not know. But I must appeal to
                                   gentlemen in the name of the State of Indianain the name of
                                   justice and the sacred principles that lie at the foundation of
                                   the government, let us come up to the consideration of this bill,
                                   fairly, amend the glaring blunders of its authors, and pass
                                   it.
                              Mr. OFFUTT moved to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.
                              The motion was lost by a tie vote on a call of the yeas and
                                   nays--48 to 48.
                              Mr. GIVAN moved to adjourn. The yeas and nays were demanded, and
                                   the vote resulted--yeas 45, nays 52. So the House refused to
                                   adjourn.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, demanded the previous question, but there
                                   was not a second to the demand by a majority of the House.
                              The question recurring upon the motion to reconsider, it was
                                   carried by yeas 49, nays 48.
                              A message was received from the Senate announcing the signing by
                                   the President of certain bills.
                              Mr. KIMBALL moved to refer to the bills to the Committee
                                        on Elections.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN raised the point of order that the only question which
                                   could be considered was the disposition of the reconsidered vote
                                   to print the bills.
                              The SPEAKER sustained the point of order. The question is: Will the
                                   House order the Printing of these bills [H. R. 260, S. 136?] It
                                   is the motion of the gentleman from Jefferson.
                              Mr. MILLER. I move to lay the motion to print on the table. But he
                                   was induced to withdraw the motion for the present.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN. I hope the motion to print will prevail. Here are two
                                   different bills involving the most important question in
                                   legislation; and we want to see them. [A voice: the Senate bill
                                   is printed.] I introduced one of them to-dayand we have not seen
                                   that; but I am not ashamed to print it, and let it go to the
                                   country--the people--who have a right to know what we are acting
                                   on.
                              Mr. KIMBALL might be willing to incur the expense of the printing.
                                   But this bill has been printed in the newspapers, and received
                                   both the approval and the condemnation of the press; and,
                                   therefore, the printing is unnecessary.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. I wish to say to the House and to the gentleman from
                                   Marion (Mr. Kimball), that I have seen no copy of this bill,
                                   either in the paper or anywhere else: and that I am not in the
                                   habit of going to the newspapers for information of bills before
                                   this House. I ask for the printing that the matter may be before
                                   us, that we may act intelligently.
                              Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH insisted that we have all had all the opportunity
                                   we need to examine this bill, and it is unnecessary to incur the
                                   expense of printing.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY alleged mistakes and inaccuracies in the printed bill
                                   of the Senate, and hoped the majority would give us a fair chance
                                   to look at it, that, if possible, all may come to an agreement on some just measure.
                                   Let us know at least just what we have.
                              Mr. KIMBALL insisted again that gentlemen have had the bill before
                                   them in print long enough to have considered it conscientiously,
                                   and to have determined whether it ought to pass the House; and
                                   that it must be only to gain time that they as for this printing.
                                   Only yesterday it was printed in the papers. Then why object? and
                                   why not let it go to our committee and proceed in order?
                              Mr. RICHARDSON. What harm can come to the majority by delay?
                              Mr. KIMBALL. We want to do something else.
                              Mr. MELLETT. There is another reason why it is necessary that we
                                   should make this apportiomnent at this session. I understand it
                                   is required by the Constitution that we should make it at this
                                   session, and I have no doubt that gentlemen know this. He read
                                   the provision in the fourth article of the Constitution,
                                   gathering from it, that it is part of our sworn duty to make this
                                   apportionment before the adjournment of this session: and he was
                                   therefore in favor of referring the bill to the
                                        Committee on Elections, and could see no
                                   occasion for the printing. We have seen it in the papers; and if
                                   it is not entirely correct there, the press and the country would
                                   be glad to have it in the corrected form as soon as possible.
                              Mr. BRANHAN. In what paper has it been printed?
                              Mr. KIMBALL. In yesterday's Journal.
                              Mr. GREGORY showed that it is not contemplated by the Constitution
                                   that we should make this apportionment at this session, but that
                                   the just inference is that it should go to the regular Session;
                                   and that being the case, there can be no harm in giving time for
                                   examination. I have not read the bill by Sections myself. It is
                                   true, I have heard it read here by the clerk, from whom I have
                                   been able to gather but a very imperfect understanding of it; and
                                   gentlemen tell me themselves that they do not comprehend it yet,
                                   and desire intelligent action. The gentleman from Jefferson (Mr.
                                   Branham) intimates that there has been some secret manipulations
                                   connected with it. I move, therefore, that the further
                                   consideration of this subject be postponed, and that it be made
                                   the special order for to-morrow.
                              Mr. MELLETT. Still it seems to me that the apportionment should be
                                   made at the session next after the census and the general
                                   election. If the regular session is the only session provided for
                                   in the constitution, then the gentleman's argument might
                                   be good, but it is not.
                              Mr. LENFESTY. It seems to me that this Senate bill, which is the
                                   work of the majority--if we desire that the bill should go to the
                                   appropriate committee for the purpose of amendment--we have the
                                   right to give it that direction. As far as the democratic members
                                   are concerned, who say they do not know what is contained in our
                                   bill. I believe that everyone of them has its discrepancies noted
                                   and taken down in his pocket.
                              Mr. RICHARDSON. I desire publicly to deny that.
                              Mr. LENFESTY. The gentleman may be an exception; but still I
                                   believe what I have stated to be generally true. They have
                                   examined it, in caucus and out of caucus, and perhaps a large
                                   majority of them have read it from end to end. But for the
                                   purpose of testing the sense of the House here, I move to lay the
                                   motion to print on the table.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, made the point of order, that the pending
                                   motion is to lay on the table and print.
                              The SPEAKER. Perhaps the gentleman from Grant can arrive at his
                                   object by a division of the question.
                              Mr. LENFESTY. I will withdraw that, and demand the previous
                                   question.
                              There was a second to the demand for the previous question.
                                   Affirmative 48, negative 44, and the main question was ordered,
                                   viz.: "Shall the bills [H. R. 260 and S. 136] be laid on
                                   the table and printed?" and the yeas and nays being
                                   demanded, ordered and taken thereon, resulted--yeas 47, nays

                                                  Blackford, Wilson, of Ripley, Woolflin, Wood,
                                                  Woodard, Wynn and the Speaker--50.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              So the motion to print was rejected.
                              Mr. KIMBALL moved to refer the bills to the Committee on
                                        Elections.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN moved to amend by referring the bills to the Committee
                                   of the whole House, as the special order for Thursday, immediately after the
                                   reading of the journal.
                              Mr. EDWARDS, of Lawrence, moved to lay the amendment on the
                                   table.
                              The vote thereon resulted--yeas 50, nays 43. So Mr.
                                   Cauthorn's amendment to the motion was rejected; and
                                   then the question recurred on Mr. Kimball's motion that
                                   the bills be referred to the Committee on
                                        Elections.
                              A message was received from the Senate announcing the signature of
                                   the per diem bill [H. R. 73], etc.
                              Mr. EATON moved for an adjournment, and therefore--
                              The House adjourned.

                         IN SENATE.
                         
                              WEDNESDAY, December 18, 1872.
                         
                         The Senate met pursuant to adjournment.
                         Prayer was offered by the Rev. E. B. Snyder of the M. E. Church.
                         Mr. Taylor, as a question of privilege offered a resolution reciting the
                              fact that a clerical error had occurred in the enrollment of the bill
                              [S. 45] concerning the enclosure of the Tippecanoe Battle Ground, and
                              ordering the Secretary to inform the House thereof.
                         The motion was agreed to.
                         
                              HUNTING ON ENCLOSED LANDS.
                              On motion by Mr. NEFF, the bill [H. R. 8] to prevent hunting and
                                   shooting on enclosed lands without the consent of the owner or
                                   occupant thereof, was read the second time.
                              He moved to dispense with the constitutional restriction that the
                                   bill may be put on its passage.
                              Mr. HALL moved to refer it to the Committee on Rights and
                                        Privileges.
                              Mr. NEFF appealed to Senators to withhold their dilatory motions
                                   and allow the bill to pass, as it is one in which his
                                   constituents are very much interested.
                              Mr. BROWN looked upon the bill with anxiety, and objected to its
                                   being hurried through the Senate.
                              Mr. BOONE had suffered from carelessness by hunters living 100
                                   miles away, and thinking this bill would have a wholsome effect,
                                   hoped it would pass.
                              Mr. STEELE had confidence enough in his neighbors to believe that
                                   they will not commit depredations on his lands, and thought this
                                   bill looked too much like the regulations of England, made to
                                   favor the large landed proprietors there. Such a law would create
                                   more difficulty among neighbors than any measures that would be
                                   passed. Mr. S. was opposed to the bill. He said he had no
                                   objection to his neighbors hunting over his fields and woods for
                                   squirrels or crows.
                              The PRESIDENT (interrupting) thought the Senator should omit
                                   "crows," as there had not been much demand for
                                   that sort of game of late.
                              Mr, SCOTT earnestly advocated the bill.
                              Mr. GREGG moved that the bill be referred to the Committee
                                        on Rights and Privileges.
                              Mr. DAGGY moved to law the motion on the table.--yeas 27, nays
                                   17.
                              After discussion the motion was agreed to.
                              On motion of Mr. BROWN, the bill was amended so as to make its
                                   provisions more specific.
                              Mr. GREGG submitted an amendment, as follows:
                              Any person or persons who shall trespass upon inclosed lands of
                                   another, by walking through or over the same, without license,
                                   after being notified of the objection of the owner or occupant of
                                   said lands, either personally or by notices properly posted, to
                                   the number of three or more to any one inclosure the posting of
                                   which shall be deemed equivalent to personal notice, shall be
                                   deemed guilty of a malicious tresspass, and on conviction thereof
                                   shall be punished as in other cases of malicious tresepass.
                              Sundry other amendments were offered.
                              
                              Mr. GOODING moved that the bill, with the amendments, be referred
                                   to the Committee on the Judiciary.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              The Senate then took a recess till two o'clock.

                              At two o'clock the principal Secretary rapped on the

                              On motion by Mr. O'BRIEN the bill [H. R. 90] to legalize
                                   the acts of the Trustees of Sharpsville in building a school
                                   house on a public square was read the first time and finally
                                   passed by yeas 43, nays 0, under a dispensation of the
                                   Constitutional restriction.
                         
                         
                              APPOINTMENTS.
                              On motion by Mr. STEELE, the appointment by the Governor of John W.
                                   Ray, of Marion county, as Commissioner of the House of Refuge, to
                                   serve till March, 1875, also Amos S. Evans, of Allen county, to
                                   serve till March 1, 1877, were ratified and confirmed.
                         
                         
                              UNION STOCK YARDS.
                              On motion by Mr. OLIVER, the bill [S. 151] to amend the
                                   manufacturing and mining incorporation act so as to authorize the
                                   incorporation of union stock yards and transfer companies and
                                   elevator companies, was read the third time.
                              Mr. OLIVER stated that this bill was for the purpose of forming a
                                   law under which union stock yards and transfer companies and
                                   grain elevator companies maybe organized. His constituency were
                                   particularly interested in this measure at this time, as there
                                   are organizations being now formed not only for a stock yard, but
                                   a grain elevator is in progress of erection, which is expected to
                                   cost over $100,000. The bill passed--yeas 42, nays 0.
                         
                         
                              SURVEY AND PLAT.
                              On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS, the bill [H. R. 95] authorizing
                                   incorporated cities and towns to adopt a survey and plat thereof,
                                   was read the second time.
                              On his further motion, under a dispensation of the constitutional
                                   restriction, the bill was read the third time and passed--yeas
                                   42, nays 1.
                         
                         
                              SIXTH COMMON PLEAS.
                              On motion by Mr. BEESON the bill. [H. R. 172] to fix the time of
                                   the Common Pleas Courts in the Sixth District--Franklin, Union,
                                   Fayette and Wayne countieswas read the second time.
                              On his further motion the rule prescribed by the Constitution was
                                   suspended, and the bill was read the third time and passed--yeas
                                   45, nays 0.
                         
                         
                              SCHOOL TAXATION.
                              Mr. SCOTT, by leave, presented a report from the Committee
                                        on Education, returning the bill [S. 150] for the
                                   legalizing school taxation, to legalize taxes heretofore levied
                                   for tuition by school trustees of any town or city, etc., with
                                   recommendation that it pass.
                              On his further motion the rule was suspended and the bill
                                   passed.
                         
                         
                              CALUMET DAM.
                              Mr. WADGE, from the special committee to whom was referred the
                                   report of the Attorney General on the Calumet Dam, reported a
                                   concurrent resolution authorizing the Attorney General to proceed
                                   as best he may to abate the nuisance.
                              The report was concurred in.
                         
                         
                              INCREASE OF SALARY.
                              On motion by Mr. GOODING, the bill [H. R. 113] to allow the
                                   Attorney GeneraI a salary of $3,000 and a docket fee of ten per
                                   cent. to be taxed against the adverse party, was read the first
                                   time.
                              He made an ineffectual motion--yeas 19, nays 22--to dispense with
                                   the constitutional restriction, that the bill may be passed to
                                   its passage.
                         
                         
                              LEGALIZING TAXES.
                              On motion by Mr. HARNEY, the bill [S. 150] to legalized taxes
                                   heretofore levied by school trustees, in any incorporated city in
                                   this State, not to exceed the amount allowed by law, was read the
                                   second time.
                              On his further motion the bill was considered engrossed, read the
                                   third time and passed--yeas 40, nays 2--under a constitutional
                                   dispensation.
                              On motion by Mr. DAGGY, the [bill H. R. 227] to transfer to
                                   township trustees monies that have been collected for specific or
                                   general purposes, except such as have been collected for State or
                                   county revenue, was read the second time.
                              On motion by Mr. BROWN, it was referred to the Judiciary
                                        Committee, together with the bill H. R. 235 and
                                   the bill S. 161, both on the same subject.
                         
                         
                              JUSTICE JURISDICTION.
                              On motion by Mr. BUNYAN, the bill [H. R. 7] providing that Justices
                                   shall have original exclusive jurisdiction in cases of misdemeanors where the fine does
                                   not exceed $25, was read the second time.
                              On motion by Mr. SLEETH, the bill was amended by saying all cases
                                   pending in the courts.
                              On motion of Mr. GLESSNER, the word "can" was
                                   substituted for the word "does" not exceed $25
                                   fine.
                              On motion by Mr. BUNYAN, the bill was read a third time under a
                                   dispensation of the constitutional provision.
                              Mr. DAGGY doubted the propriety of passing the bill.
                              So did Mr. BOONE. He said Justices were apt to be slow in dealing
                                   with cases, especially where defendants were desperadoes. It was
                                   often important that cases of the class referred to should be
                                   prosecuted more vigorously than those which involve crimes of a
                                   higher grade.
                              Mr. GREGG said the object of the bill was to relieve the higher
                                   courts of these petty cases.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS said the bill would deprive the mayors of cities of
                                   the authority to try this class of cases. More than that, it
                                   would take these cases away from the grand jury and result in an
                                   exemption of offenders from punishment in these small cases.
                              Mr BUNYAN was willing that this bill shall be recommitted to the
                                        Judiciary Committee, so that time shall
                                   not be further taken up in its discussion.
                              It was so ordered.
                         
                         
                              BRIBERY OF OFFICERS.
                              On motion by Mr. SCOTT, the bill [H. R. 148] defining certain
                                   felonies and prescribing punishment therefor, compelling
                                   testimony by parties engaged therein, or against others and
                                   themselves, etc. [Any officer pecuniarily interested in any
                                   public work shall be fined and imprisoned, as well as any
                                   contractor of any public work who may give any bribe, drawback or
                                   other interest to any public officer.]
                              Mr. SCOTT moved for a dispensation that it may be read the second
                                   time.
                              Mr. ORR opposed hasty legislation. He favored this bill, but
                                   desired to see all such important measures carefully
                                   considered.
                              The constitutional restriction was dispensed with, yeas 37, nays 7,
                                   and the bill was read the second time.
                              Mr. SCOTT moved that the rule be suspended read the second
                                   time.
                              It was carried, and the bill read.
                              Mr. SCOTT moved to amend so as to provide that before the removal
                                   of a county seat no new court house shall be built until a
                                   majority of the qualified voters at a regular election shall have
                                   signified their desire therefor.
                              Mr. BROWN made the point of order that the amendment was not
                                   germain to the bill.
                              Mr. SCOTT withdrew the amendment.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS moved to amend by including any person holding any
                                   appointing power, and such persons as may offer bribes or hope of
                                   reward to officials.
                              It was agreed to.
                              Mr. RHODES moved to amend by including the word
                                   "town," so it will be read "county,
                                   township, town or city."
                              The bill was referred to the Committee on County and
                                        Township Business.
                         
                         
                              CLERKS OF COMMITTEES.
                              On motion by Mr. DWIGGINS, the House amendments to the bill [S.
                                   145] striking out the provision with reference to the employment
                                   of Clerks to Committees, increasing the number of copiyng and
                                   engrossing clerks and striking out the sections referring to the
                                   officers who shall organize the General Assembly, were read.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved that the Senate refuse to concur with the
                                   amendments of the House.
                              It was agreed to.
                              The PRESIDENT subsequently appointed Messrs. Dwiggins and Slater
                                        the Committee of Conference on the part of the
                                        Senate.
                         
                         
                              COUNTY STATIONERY.
                              Mr. BUNYAN, from the Committee on County and
                                        Township business, returned the bill [S. 157] with
                                   reference to the buying of stationery for county and court
                                   officers, with amendments.
                         
                         
                              THE SCHOOL FUND.
                              Mr. STEELE, from the Committee on Finance, in
                                   compliance with a resolution of the Senate, reported a bill
                                   authorizing the $170,333 02, due from the State to be repaid to
                                   the school fund, which was entitled an act to provide for the
                                   payment to the school fund, certain moneys due to the State and
                                   to distribute the same; but the committee could not recommend the
                                   passage of the bill, for reasons recited; one reason being that
                                   the treasury will not be in a condition to repay the same for two
                                   years to come.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS moved to lay the whole matter on the table.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              On motion by Mr. HUBBARD, the bill [S. 15] to authorize cities and
                                   towns to issue bonds to erect or finish school buildings, was
                                   read the second time.
                         
                         
                         
                              NEW STATE HOUSE.
                              On motion by Mr. OLIVER the House concurred in the resolution
                                   offering a premium of one thousand dollars for an acceptable plan
                                   for a new State House, and appointing a committee of three
                                   Representatives and two Senators to receive and report on said
                                   plan near the close of the next session of the Legislature, was
                                   taken up and adopted.
                              The PRESIDENT subsequently appointed Messrs. Oliver and Scott the
                                        committee on the part of the Senate.
                         
                         
                              HUNTINGBURG.
                              On motion by Mr. CAVE, the bill [H. R. 185] to legalize the
                                   official acts of the Board of Trustees of the town of
                                   Huntingburg, Dubois county, Indiana, and all the officers of said
                                   town, was read the first time.
                         
                         
                              MICHIGAN CITY HARBOR.
                              On motion by Mr. WINTERBOTHAM, the joint resolution [H. R. 7] in
                                   relation to an appropriation of money by Congress to complete the
                                   harbor at Michigan City was adopted--yeas 39, nays 0.
                         
                         
                              EXEMPTION.
                              On motion by Mr. BROWN, the bill [S. 147] to exempt certain
                                   property from execution, was read the second time and referred to
                                   the Judiciary Committee.
                         
                         
                              PER DIEM OF MEMBERS.
                              Mr. HOUGH moved that the vote on the passage of the bill [H. R.
                                   173] increasing the per diem of members of the General Assembly
                                   to eight dollars a day be reconsidered.
                              The PRESIDENT was of the opinion that the bill was beyond the reach
                                   of the Senate, having been sent to the Governor.
                         
                         
                              HUNTINGSBURG.
                              On motion by Mr. CAVE, the constitutional restriction was dispensed
                                   with by yeas 39, nays 1, and the bill [H. R. 185] to legalize the
                                   acts of the Trustees and officers of the town of Huntingsburg,
                                   Dubois county, was read the second time by title and the third
                                   time by sections, and passed the Senate by yeas 39, nays 0.

                              On motion by Mr. DWIGGINS, the bill [H. R. 134] to fix the terms of
                                   courts in the Twelfth Judicial Circuit of the State of
                                   Indiana--White, Newton, Jasper, Benton and Tippecanoe countieswas
                                   read the third time and passed--yeas 41, nays 0.

                              Mr. SLATER offered a resolution as follows:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, That the State Printer
                                                  be authorized to bind in sheep, aud send to each
                                                  member of the Senate and the elective officers
                                                  thereof three copies each of the Acts, the
                                                  Journals of the House and Senate, Documentary
                                                  Journals and Brevier Reports.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              It was adopted.And then the Senate adjourned until to-morrow at ten
                                   o'clock a.m.

                         HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                         
                              WEDNESDAY, December 18, 1872.
                         
                         The SPEAKER directed the reading of the journal of yesterday.
                         On motion of Mr. TROUTMAN the reading was dispensed with.
                         
                              APPORTIONMENT FOR REPRESENTATION.
                              The SPEAKER resumed the unfinished business of yesterday, viz: the
                                   consideration of the bill [S. 146] to fix the number of Senators
                                   and Representatives of the General Assembly, and apportion the
                                   same among the several counties of the State--the question being
                                   on Mr. Kimball's motion to refer it to the
                                        Committee on Elections.
                              Mr. BRANHAM asked only that we may have a chance to amend the
                                   bill--to apply such amendments as he was infromed ought to be
                                   made; and when the bill shall be so amended, it was due to the
                                   House and the country that it should be printed. The indiscrete
                                   haste with which we are trying to pass a great many bills here
                                   must be detrimental to the public good. He was willing that the
                                   bill should go through this session if it can be made acceptable
                                   and right. The motion he made yesterday was at the suggestion of
                                   Republican members; but they saw proper to take a different
                                   direction. What he then asked was on the principle of right and
                                   justice--looking far ahead of the party. The words of Henry Clay
                                   were the impulse of the noblest principles ever uttered, when he
                                   said: "I'd rather be right than be
                                   President." He asked here only for a fair chance to see
                                   what we are voting for, and did not care a groat whether he was
                                   read out of the party or not. His stock in politics had never
                                   been very valuable, and if gentlemen in caucus see proper to turn
                                   him out, they are welcome to do so. He asked them no odds. He was
                                   obliged to the gentleman from Delaware for the information he
                                   tendered yesterday, on the point of Constitutional law, by which
                                   that gentleman concludes that the apportionment bids must pass at
                                   this session; and he apoloogized for the thick skull that
                                   excluded conviction from his understanding.
                              What if the Governor had forgotten to call this extra
                                   session?--what then would have become of this bill? But what was
                                   the object in keeping back the bill all these weeks, and just at
                                   the close of the session send one in here from the Senate with
                                   instructions to pass it at once; a bill of which a Senator who
                                   voted it has said: "It is an infamous measure and ought
                                   not to pass." Why did not the majority print the bill?
                                   Were they afraid to do it? Where did the bill come from? Did it
                                   come from the Committee on Elections? And he
                                   would have the gentleman so learned in constitutional lore to
                                   tell us what law authorizes the Senate to make this
                                   apportionment? He might be mistaken, but he had always thought it
                                   the duty of the representatives of the people to make the
                                   apportionment; and he understood it as a part of the oath of a
                                   Representative that, when upon this business, we should make fair apportionment. It
                                   may be that he was mistaken. As an apology for himself, he could
                                   say to the gentleman from Marion that he was ignorant till last
                                   night that the daily papers were a source of information for this
                                   House. Till then, when that gentleman so informed him, he did not
                                   know that the papers were to be presented to this House for
                                   information. It might be all his ignorance; but he did not get
                                   the Sentinel, and perhaps that is as fair a
                                   source of information as we have. Now all he wanted is that this
                                   bill be properly amended and when so amended, that members of the
                                   House have opportunity to examine it, and be able to vote on it
                                   intelligently. If the majority will do so much that ends the
                                   difficulty. For himself he would stand here and talk till
                                   Saturday night (he did not talk very fast) before he would permit
                                   the bill to pass in its present shape; but from outside of a
                                   healthy organization he spoke not for others. But with reference
                                   to the passage of the bill at this session, if it should fail he
                                   would hold the Committee on Elections
                                   responsible for it. It was the duty of that committee to have
                                   reported an apportionment bill long ago. This was their fault,
                                   not his. But he was willing to withdraw opposition like this. Let
                                   it make no difference where the amendments come from, if they be
                                   such as ought to be made. Let us see it, and then we may pass the
                                   bill.
                              On motion of Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, there was a call of the House,
                                   which determined ninety-one members present.
                              On motion of Mr. BILLINGSLEY, further proceedings under the call of
                                   the House were dispensed with.
                              Mr, WALKER moved to lay Mr. Kimball's motion to refer on
                                   the table.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. KIMBALL called for the reading of the bill.
                              The bill was read by the clerk, and the SPEAKER stated the
                                   question: Shall the bill pass to the third reading to-morrow?
                              Mr. KIMBALL was of the opinion that the bill should be amended.
                                   There was no disposition on the part of the majority to tyrannize
                                   over any one in opposition, whether he belonged to the party of
                                   the minority or the majority. He had come there to do his duty to
                                   the State and country. The majority had the right to do right.
                                   Believing that the action of his party always resulted in good to
                                   the whole country, it followed, in his opinion, that whatever the
                                   majority decided on must be right. He only asked that the State
                                   be fairly apportioned, and that the majority might be heard
                                   before being denounced.When the opposition were in power they had
                                   treated the minority as having no rights. The House was not
                                   acting under dictation in this matter. The bill had come from the
                                   Senate in a proper manner, and there had been nothing irregular
                                   about it. He understood it to be the duty of the Legislature to
                                   pass this bill at the present session, and speedy action was
                                   demanded for this reason alone.
                              He then submitted sundry amendments to the bill, which were read by
                                   the gentleman himself, the Reading Clerk at the same time reading
                                   from the bill, to show the effect the amendments would
                                   produce.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, moved the previous question on the
                                   amendments.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY hoped the gentleman would withdraw his motion, and not
                                   cut off all debate.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN hoped that Mr. Shirley would withdraw his
                                   objections.
                              Mr. WILSON adheared to the demand, and there was a second to the
                                   demand for the previous question, and under its pressure the
                                   amendments submitted by Mr. Kimball were adopted.
                              The SPEAKER again state the question on the order for the
                                   engrossment of the amendments, and the third reading of the
                                   bill.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN moved that the bill as amended be laid on the table and
                                   printed. I desire, said he, to say a few words to the House. I
                                   believe that I have the intelligence to look at a bill and
                                   determine whether it is right or not; and I desire, when an
                                   important measure comes up to do so. I do not know anything about
                                   this bill. I have not attended any Republican caucus, and it has
                                   not been discussed in any Democratic caucus. It is certainly a
                                   most important bill. It involves the only question in legislation
                                   that can give to the minority the right to break a quorum. Now,
                                   if this measure is forced to the final vote at this time, it
                                   would be simply forcing a measure of the greatest importance of
                                   any that could come before us and so far it would be doing
                                   something very unstatesmanlike. I do not believe that there ever
                                   was a measure that culminated in breaking a quorum in any
                                   legislative body but it was the fault of the majority. I do not
                                   excuse my own political party. The remark applies equally to both
                                   sides. But why cannot we, my friends, be so forbearing toward
                                   those who are not of our political sentiments that we can act
                                   with more discretion upon this question than those who have been
                                   here before? Can't we rise to higher plane? We are but trancient beings--we
                                   live but a little while and pass away.
                              
                                   "We are all such stuff as dreams are made of,
                                   And our little life is rounded with a sleep."
                              
                              Why should we do injustice to the minority? Why pass this measure
                                   and give occasion to those coming after us to look upon our folly
                                   and regret it? Mr. Speaker I do not claim to speak for the
                                   Democratic party; for so far as I know that party stands with
                                   folded arms ready and willing that the historian may write down
                                   the record of her deeds whether right or wrong. The judgment of
                                   men in the future must determine whether or not her history has
                                   been glorious. This bill is not a strike at the Democratic party.
                                   That party is like a man that has sunk to the grave, and when the
                                   sods of the valley are over him; you can't injure it,
                                   because it is out of the way. But gentlemen have told me that
                                   this bill is a great wrong. I do not believe that the wrongs in
                                   the original bill have all been remedied by the amendments of the
                                   gentlleman from Marion. But I say, let us have it printed, and
                                   see what it is. I think I see a propriety in carrying the
                                   consideration of this bill to the next session, I believe it will
                                   be better for the party and for the interests of the State. I
                                   speak not of my own party--having no party to serve. I am here to
                                   serve my country, and cut loose from everything but the right. He
                                   was there to serve his country and the right, and the right
                                   demanded greater deliberation; for if action was had now, the
                                   members must vote in ignorance. He would plead with the majority
                                   as earnestly and humbly as he would with God for the pardon of
                                   the sins of his life, to withhold their hands and not do this
                                   wrong. There is a lurking devil in us that constantly impels us
                                   to wrong actions; but the members, when they found this impulse
                                   striving within them should have the courage to say,
                                   "Get thee behind me." He conceded to the
                                   majority the right to take advantage of the situation. To the
                                   victors belong the spoils, but they should not be gathered at the
                                   cost of honor. This haste is undignified. Let us act upon
                                   consideration, and we shall feel the better for it. It had been
                                   contemplated by the framers of our State government that the
                                   Senate should stand as a wall against which the wave of hasty
                                   legislation should break; but the judgment of the public was that
                                   this House was now the conservative branch of the legislature.
                                   Let it do justice to itself and the people.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, said that if he could blot out remembrance
                                   of the history of legislation in this State, he could favor the
                                   printing of this bill. The majority had been more than just to
                                   the minority, and the provisions of the bill were as fair as the
                                   latter had a right to expect. The appeal for justice was only an
                                   appeal for delay. He did not believe the minority would stay in
                                   the next regular session if the bill should be passed over. The
                                   gentleman from Johnson (Mr. Woollen) might be honest in his
                                   declarations, but he was not disposed to trust the other members
                                   of the party. There were men in the majority who had stood like
                                   walls to protect the rights of the minority and yet the latter
                                   come here and ask for delay, which means the defeat of any final
                                   action on the subject. He was willing to do whatever was fair,
                                   but whatever was done must be done at this session if the
                                   majority discharge their duty. The majority in some cases: have
                                   given the minority more than they are entitled to. For instance,
                                   Ripley, Ohio, and Switzerland have one Senator, Ripley, Decatur,
                                   and Rush bave a Representative, and Ripley has a Representative
                                   alone.
                              Mr. HENDERSON thought they ought to have the opportunity to examine
                                   the bill. He saw no good reason why the bill should be pushed. It
                                   had been intimated that there may be resignations next term. He
                                   would quiet the nerves of gentlemen by assuring them that there
                                   was no sort of danger. He had no party to serve. Two years ago
                                   the minority resigned when the matter was not pushed as far as it
                                   is now. He then opposed the apportionment himself, and would say
                                   to the House now that there was no danger of it ever passing, and
                                   there was no intention that it should pass. For himself, he was
                                   outside of all political organizations. Two years ago he felt the
                                   shackles fall from his limbs. Now he would say to the majority
                                   that if he were an emissary sent here to kill them off as a
                                   party, nothing would more effectually do it for him than the
                                   passage of this apportionment bill, if it is wrong.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY desired to answer the gentleman from Ripley as to his
                                   objection to this bill. In my own district of Morgan and Johnson
                                   we are deprived of a representation which we have had for twelve
                                   years. Since the present apportionment was made two railroads
                                   have been built through those counties; and there is more reason
                                   now that it should remain with us than there was when it was
                                   made.
                              Mr. KIMBALL moved for an amendment of the pending motion (which was
                                   accepted by Mr. Woollen) that the bill be printed and laid on the
                                   desks of the members, and made the special order for ten
                                   o'clock to- morrow
                                   morning, and that a committee of two be appointed to take charge
                                   of the printing of the bill.
                              And, accordingly, the order was taken by consent.
                              The SPEAKER appointed as committee, to supervise the printing,
                                   Messrs. Kimball and Woollen.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN moved to take up Senate bill 54, to divide the State
                                   into thirteen Congressional districts.
                              The motion was agreed to, and the bill was read by the clerk.
                              Mr. KIMBALL moved that the bill take the same course as the
                                   Legislative Apportionment bills.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                         
                         
                              NAMES ON THE BATTLE FLAGS.
                              Mr. KIMBALL offered a resolution condemning the course of Charles
                                   Sumner in relation to the erasing of names from battle flags, and
                                   approving the action of Congress in relation thereto.
                              It was adopted.
                         
                         
                              TIPPECANOE BATTLE GROUND.
                              A message was received from the Senate asking the return of the
                                   Senate bill No. 45, for the enclosure of the Tippecanoe battle
                                   ground, which had been transmitted to the House improperly
                                   engrossed and so passed, and asking the House to reconsider its
                                   action and concur in the properly engrossed bill.
                              The matter of the message from the Senate was immediately taken up,
                                   and, by unanimous consent, it was ordered that the vote on the
                                   final message of said Tippecanoe Battle Ground bill [S. 45] be
                                   taken as reconsidered and pending, and that the bill be returned
                                   to the Senate for correction. And subsequently when the bill was
                                   returned with the corrected engrossment, it was finally passed
                                   the House of Representatives--yeas 73, nays 10.
                              On motion of Mr. WYNN, the Senate bill No. 59, amending sections
                                   12, 14, 18, and repealing section 15 of the act authorizing
                                   counties and townships to extend aid to railroads, was taken up,
                                   read and referred to the Committee on
                                        Railroads.
                              The Senate bill No. 115, to prevent extortionate charges and unjust
                                   discriminations in freights by railroad companies, was taken up,
                                   read and referred to the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary.
                         
                         
                              BANKING.
                              The bill [S. 2] to authorize and regulate the incorporation of
                                   banks of discount and deposit in the Senate of Indiana, was taken
                                   up and read.
                              On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the restrictions were suspended and the
                                   bill read the second time.
                              Mr. BAKER desired to have the bill printed and laid over.
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE said the object of the bill is to provide that in
                                   case of the death of a partner, the business may be carried on,
                                   and not wound up, as now required for the organization of private
                                   banking companies as incorporated companies, so that the business
                                   may not be broken up by the death of any member. It provides,
                                   also, for regular publication of its condition. It does not
                                   compel any banking company to come under its provisions.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. The bill was introduced in the early part of the
                                   session, printed and laid on the desks of members. It has not
                                   been changed in the Senate.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY said the bill, or one like it, had been introduced in
                                   the House and referred to the Committee on
                                        Corporations. That committee had thoroughly
                                   examined the bill, and were unable to report favorably upon it.
                                   It made the stockholders liable only for an amount double
                                   theamount of stock held by them. There was not adequate security
                                   for depositors. The same provisions were incorporated in the
                                   National Banking law, but he did not regard that as any reason
                                   why this House should do an injustice. If forced to vote now, he
                                   must vote against the bill.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN submitted sundry amendments to the following
                                   effect:
                              SECTION-- . The Auditor of State (with the
                                   approbation of the Governor) as often as he shall deem necessary
                                   or proper, shall appoint some suitable person or persons to
                                   investigate any bank or or banking association incorporated under
                                   this act, who shall not be officers of any such association; and
                                   such person shall have power to make a thorough examination of
                                   the business and condition of such bank--to examine any officer
                                   or agent thereof under oath--and shall make a full report thereof
                                   to the Auditor; and such associations shall not be subject to any
                                   visitorial power, except as in this act provided, and such person
                                   shall receive $5 per day and $2 for every 25 miles travel--to be
                                   paid by the association by him examined.
                              SECTION-- . Every such association shall make to
                                   the Auditor of State not less than five reports in each year,
                                   which reports shall exhibit the resources and liabilities of such
                                   institution and shall transmit the same to the Auditor within
                                   four days after the request or requisition from him; and every
                                   such report shall be published in some newspaper of the place
                                   where such association is located, at the expense of the
                                   association. Penalty, $100 a day for each day's delay of
                                   any such report, etc.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. We will accept the amendments. I have no interest
                                   whatever in this bill, neither has anybody in my section that I
                                   know of. The sane thing was introduced by me in the early part of
                                   the session at the solicitation of personal friends. The whole
                                   object, is to enable those banks, in case of the death of a
                                   partner, to carry on their buslness.
                              
                              Mr. MILLER moved to refer the bill, as amended, to the
                                        Committee on Corporations.
                              On the motion of Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, it was laid on the table,
                                   and it was ordered that 200 copies thereof be printed.
                         
                         
                              EVANSVILLE GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS.
                              The bill [S. 87] granting the consent of the State to the purchase
                                   by the United States, for the purpose of public buildings,
                                   certain grounds in Evansville, was taken up and read.
                              On motion of Mr. BAKER, the restrictions were suspended, and the
                                   bill finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas 79, nays
                                   0.
                         
                         
                              CONSTITUTION--CANAL DEBT SUBMISSION.
                              The bill [S. 159] to provide for the time of submission to the
                                   people the question of the Constitutional amendment heretofore
                                   proposed by joint resolution to prevent payment on account of
                                   canal certificates and internal improvement bonds arranged under
                                   the Butler bills of 1846 and 1847--it provides for the submission
                                   of this question on the 28th of January, 1873. It was passed to
                                   the second reading.
                         
                         
                              FELONIES OF TIMBER.
                              Mr. HATCH'S bill [H. R. 191] defining certain felonies,
                                   prescribing penalties therefor, and repealing, etc., was referred
                                   again to the Committee on Agriculture with
                                   instructions to strke out "felony" and insert
                                   "misdemeanor" in lieu.
                         
                         
                              COMMON SCHOOLS.
                              Mr. MELLETT (by unanimous consent) introduced a bill [H. R. 261] to
                                   amend the common school law. It raises the levy from 16 to 20
                                   cents, and provides that the money thus collected shall be
                                   applied for tuition purposes only.
                              Referred to the Committee of the Whole and made the special order
                                   for eleven o'clock Thursday morning.
                              A message was received from the Senate transmitting for the
                                   signature of the Speaker enrolled Senate Act 45, for the
                                   enclosure of the Tippecanoe Battle Ground.
                         
                         
                              TRUSTEES--LEGALIZATION.
                              Mr. FEED'S bill [H. R. 185] to legalize the acts of the
                                   Trustees of the town of Huntingburg, Dubois county, was taken up
                                   on the third reading and finally passed the House of
                                   Representatives--yeas 76, nays 0.
                              On motion of Mr. BLOCHER the House took a recess till two
                                   o'clock p. m.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The House reassembled at two o'clock.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN rose to a privileged question, and called for the
                                   reading of the indorsements upon the apportionment bills--House
                                   bill 260, and Senate bill 146. The indorsements were read,
                                   showing the second reading to-day.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN wanted to know by what authority the order of business
                                   had been suspended, and the bills read the second time.
                              The SPEAKER. By the order of the House.
                              Mr. KIMBALL explained that the order had been suspended on the
                                   motion of Mr. Branham.
                         
                         
                              PRESERVATION OF THE JOURNALS.
                              The SPEAKER announced the consideration of Mr. Cauthorn's
                                   bill [H. H. 167] to preserve the original manuscripts of the
                                   journals of the Senate and House of Representatives of the
                                   General Assembly, etc., it being on the third reading.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN demanded a call of the House, which proceeded, and
                                   determined a quorum--78 members present. The bill was finally
                                   passed the House of Representatives. Yeas 78, nays 0.
                         
                         
                              ATTACHMENT.
                              Mr. Brett's bill [H. R. 170] to amend the 157th and 664th
                                   sections of the the Practice Act of June 18, 1852, was taken up
                                   in order on the third reading [by giving creditors of absconding
                                   debtors, whose claims are not due at the time when such debtor
                                   absconds, the same rights as other creditors as to
                                   attachments.]
                              Mr. BRETT. I introduced this bill at the request of a gentleman of
                                   my town, and requested its reference to the Judiciary
                                        Committee. That committee gave it their attention
                                   and recommended its passage with amendments. I am informed that
                                   it is a meritorious bill. It is intended to protect those having
                                   claims against absconding debtors, and not due at the time of the
                                   running away. Under the present law parties whose claims are not
                                   due can't come in under attachments, while those whose
                                   demands are due can claim the whole.
                              The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas 84,
                                   nays 0.
                              Mr. WILLARD moved for the reconsideration of the vote of this
                                   morning by which the apportionment bill [S. 146] was to be
                                   printed.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN. I move to lay the motion to reconsider on the
                                   table.
                              The SPEAKER. The gentleman can't reach the order to print
                                   without recon- sidering the
                                   vote by which the bill was made the special order.
                         
                         
                              DOWER.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Riply, obtained unanimous consent to return from the
                                        Committee on the Organization of Courts
                                   his bill [H. R. 214] to amend sections 25 and 26 of the act of
                                   May 14,1852, to regulate descents and apportionments of estates,
                                   with an amendments (clerical), recommending its passage--it being
                                   on the third reading.
                              The amendment was adopted.
                              Mr. W. said: The law now provides that if the husband dies without
                                   children, the property goes to the wife; and if the wfdow dies
                                   the week after the property goes to her relatives. The same law
                                   also applies to the wife. In such cases it takes the property
                                   away from the blood of the original owner. This bill makes ample
                                   provision for the widow or the surviving husband--giving them
                                   $10,000 absolutely, where the estate exceeds that amount--and
                                   one-third of the remainder.
                              Mr. LENFESTY doubted about that feature of the bill which gives the
                                   two-thirds--less the $10,000--to the brothers and sisters. I
                                   believe that when a man dies seized of property, it should go to
                                   his family. [A voice"If he have children it all goes to
                                   them."]
                              The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas, 79;
                                   nays, 6.
                              Mr. WESNER, by unanimous consent, submitted a proposition for a
                                   clause in the specific bill to pay Judges for holding adjourned
                                   terms of Court within the last two years, appropriating $3,500
                                   for that object; and providing that no such Judge shall receive
                                   more than $10 per day.
                              It was referred to the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means.
                         
                         
                              CRIMINAL PRACTICE
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley's, bill [H. R. 178] to amend section
                                   1 of the act of December 20, 1865, to amend the 77th section of
                                   the criminal practice act of June 17, 1852, was taken up in order
                                   and passed the final reading--yeas, 74; nays, 2.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley's, bill [H. R. 179] to amend section
                                   1 of the act of February 2, 1855, to amend the practice act of
                                   June 18, 1852, was taken up. [It provides that where newspaper
                                   publication of the sale of real estate is omitted, the sheriff
                                   shall state the cause in his report; also, where the publisher
                                   refuses, and where there is no newspaper in the county;--to
                                   prevent exorbitant charges, and providing that the newspaper
                                   shall be of general circulation, and shall be printed and
                                   published in the county.]
                              Messrs. GIVAN and COBB objected to it as either not sufficiently
                                   explicit or unnecessary.
                              The bill was rejected on the second reading.
                         
                         
                              TOWNSHIPS--TOWNS.
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE'S bill [H. R. 187] to prohibit township
                                   trustees from levying tax on the inhabitants of incorporated
                                   towns, repealing, etc., was taken up on the third reading.
                              Mr. S. had introduced this bill at the request of citizens of an
                                   incorporated town in his county. It grows out of the fact, that
                                   some time ago the township trustee requested the auditor of
                                   Morgan County to place on the tax duplicate for school and road
                                   purposes the property of the citizens of the town of
                                   Martinsville, and the auditor refused to do so, because the said
                                   citizens' property were already assessed for school and
                                   road purposes. Upon this, suit was brought in the Circuit Court
                                   and the decision was against the auditor, and it was appealed to
                                   the Supreme Court, where the case is now pending. This bill
                                   provides that, hereafter, there shall be equal taxation in the
                                   township, within and without the town corporation; that the
                                   township trustee shall not take the corporation assessments on
                                   property which the corporation has taxed by its own
                                   authority.
                              Mr. MILLER. The bill should provide that the town itself shall be
                                   acting under its corporate authorities.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY, also took exceptions to the bill, and it was
                                   rejected--yeas 14; nays, 64.
                         
                         
                              CALUMET FEEDER DAM.
                              A message was received from the Senate, transmitting a concurrent
                                   resolution which had been adopted on the part of that branch of
                                   the General Assembly, directing the Attorney General to take such
                                   steps as he may see fit, to secure the removal of the dam in
                                   Calumet river, at Blue Island, Illinois, and authorizing the
                                   Governor to draw his warrant for defraying necessary
                                   expenses.
                         
                         
                              SERVICE OF EXECUTIONS.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY'S bill [H. R. 188] to amend section 433 of the
                                   practice act of June 18, 1852, (concerning service of
                                   executions,) was taken up on the third reading.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY. My amendment here is in regard to the duties of the
                                   Sheriff when he receives an execution. As the law now is, he has
                                   "a reasonable time" to proceed to the sale, and
                                   some say one time and some another is a reasonable time. I hold
                                   that thirty days is a reasonable time for him to make service of the
                                   writ. A constable is required to make service and return in
                                   thirty days. Now, I make the Sheriff's time the same as
                                   the constable'sexcept in cases where the population
                                   ofthe county exceeds 20,000--in such cases I make it 50 days,
                                   unless he is otherwise directed by the judge or the
                                   plaintiff.
                              The bill was finally passed the House of Represntatives--yeas, 71;
                                   nays, 12.
                         
                         
                              GIRLS AND WOMEN REFORMATORY.
                              Mr. BAXTER'S bill [H. R. 210] to amend section 20 of the
                                   act of May 13, 1869, to establish a female prison or reformatory,
                                   for girls and women, (changing the age of admission from eighteen
                                   to sixteen years,) was taken up and finally passed the House of
                                   Representatives--yeas, 79; nays, 0.
                              Mr. BAXTER'S bill [H. R. 211] appropriating $50,000 for
                                   the Female Reformatory Prison Buildings, was taken up on the
                                   third reading.
                              Mr. B. said: Four years ago the Legislature decided that a Female
                                   Reformatory Institution should be erected near this city, and the
                                   estimated cost of it was, I think, about $125,000; and they
                                   appropriated $50,000 towards this object. With this money the
                                   building has been begun, and it is now standing in an unfinished
                                   condition. It was designed for a prison as well as a Reformitory.
                                   I visited the building myself, and went over their estimates for
                                   its completion with a great deal of care; for I considered that
                                   we have a great many appropriations to make, and I found that it
                                   would cost $70,000 to complete the building and enclose the
                                   grounds, and that, by dispensing with the fencing and grading,
                                   the very lowest estimate to complete the building would require
                                   an appropriation of $50.000. With this sum we can have a prison
                                   that will accomodate about three hundred prisoners, in a place
                                   where they may be reformed, cared for in the spirit which the
                                   constitution requires shall pervade our prison laws.
                              Mr. RUMSEY considered the importance of this bill in connection
                                   with the Governor's recommendation and reasoning
                                   thereon.
                              The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas 74,
                                   nays 4.
                         
                         
                              COSTS IN CHANGE OF VENUE--PRO TEM. JUDGE.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley's bill [H. R.218] to amend section
                                   208 of the practice act of June 18, 1852, was taken up on the
                                   third reading, making counties from which a change of venue is
                                   taken responsible for the costs, and allowing the judge to
                                   appoint an attorney to hear the case instead of calling another
                                   judge.
                              Mr. OFFUTT. I gather from the reading of the bill by the Clerk,
                                   that, instead of compelling the judge to call another judge to
                                   hold the term, he may call any reputable attorney. If that is the
                                   amendment, I think it a good one and that it ought to pass.
                              The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas, 61;
                                   nays, 13.
                         
                         
                              VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATIONS--WILLS.
                              On motion of Mr. KIMBALL, the bill [S. 3] to amend section 4 of the
                                   act concerning the organization and perpetuity of voluntary
                                   associations, and repealing the act of February 12, 1855, and
                                   repealing each act repealed by said act, and to authorize wills
                                   and devises to be made in compliance with the provisions of this
                                   act, was taken up on the third reading.
                              Mr. LENFESTY. This Senate bill has received a favorable report from
                                   the Committee on Corporations. It is to admit
                                   of pay to the officers of these institutions and to empower them
                                   to contract, to lend and borrow money, etc.
                              The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas, 65;
                                   nays, 9.
                              Mr. WILLARD asked and obtained leave of absence till Friday
                                   noon.
                         
                         
                              BANK TAX FOR MUNICIPALITIES.
                              The bill [S. --] to provide for the assessment (for municipal
                                   purposes) of taxes on shares on banks and the bank stock of all
                                   banks doing business in this State, was taken up.
                              Mr. COBB. This bill covers almost the same ground of a bill we have
                                   already passed, and it seems to me that we ought to have all our
                                   assessment and collection laws in one statute. There is another
                                   objection: In this it is provided that it shall take effect on
                                   the first of May; in the other it is provided that it shall take
                                   effect on the first of April. Let us try to get along with the
                                   act we have already passed.
                              Mr. GIVAN. I do not understand that the assessment act passed at
                                   this session comprehends the object intended by this bill. That
                                   assessment law provides for the assessments for State and county
                                   purposes. The assessments for municipal purposes are made
                                   necessarily under different laws from those for State and county
                                   purposes. Section 70 of the assessment act provides nothing for
                                   this purpose, and it might be construed so as to prevent the
                                   taxation of bank shares for municipal purposes. It simply provides that nothing shall
                                   prevent such taxation; but it does not provide how these bank
                                   shares shall be assessed, whilst this bill provides the mode and
                                   manner of these assessments.
                              On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, it was referred to the Committee
                                        on Ways and Means.
                         
                         
                              DRAINAGE.
                              Mr. MARTIN'S Drainage bill [H. R 76] was taken up on the
                                   third reading, and pending its consideration--
                              The House adjourned.

                         IN SENATE.
                         
                              THURSDAY, December 19, 1872.
                         
                         The Senate met pursuant to adjournment. Prayer was offered by the Rev.
                              Mr. Asbury, pastor of Ames M. E. Church,
                         Mr. O'BRIEN moved for the printing of 200 copies of a circular
                              letter to the Clerks of Courts, prepared in pursuance of a resolution
                              of the Senate, asking for information to aid the Committee on
                                   Organization of Courts to properly prepare a bill for
                              the reorganization of the Judiciary of the State.
                         The motion was agreed to.
                         
                              MADISON CRIMINAL COURT.
                              Mr.O'BRIEN also returned the bill [H. R. 72] creating the
                                   29th Judicial Circuit (Jefferson Criminal Court) with a favorable
                                   report thereon from the majority of the committee.
                              Mr GLESSNER presented a minority report, recommending that the bill
                                   lie on the table.
                              Mr. ROSEBRUGH said that he could not vote to re-establish this
                                   Court, unless he was satisfied that it was the desire of the
                                   people of Jefferson county. He found that petitions had been
                                   received remonstrating against it, signed by 1,370 taxpayers of
                                   that county, while the petitions in favor of the measure bore but
                                   261 signatures. From this and such other information as he could
                                   obtain, he felt constrained to oppose the bill, believing that it
                                   was contrary to the wishes of the people of the county.
                              Mr. STEELE, who was one of the committee, said the majority of the
                                   committee became satisfied that a majority of the taxpayers of
                                   Jefferson county did desire the establishment of the court and
                                   their report was based on this belief.
                              After some further discussion Mr. GLESSNER moved that the whole
                                   matter be indefinitely postponed.
                              Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Scott, said he was informed by unimpeachable
                                   witnesses that a great necessity exist for the re-establishment
                                   of this Criminal Circuit in Jefferson county. The criminal cases
                                   now occupy a large part of the time of the present courts to the
                                   great injury of parties in civil cases.
                              Mr. BROWN moved to lay the whole subject on the table.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. ORR, from the Committee on County and Township
                                        Business, reported back the bill [H. R. 148] to
                                   preventy county, township and city officers from being concerned
                                   in contracts with the county, township orcity, or town, with an
                                   amendment making the provisions apply also to State officers.
                              The report was concurred in.
                         
                         
                              THE THIRD CIRCUIT.
                              Mr. CAVE, by leave of the Senate, offered a resolution reciting
                                   that the bill [H. R. 257] changing Third Judicial Circuit, passed
                                   the Senate under a misapprehension of facts, and recalling the
                                   same from the Governor. He said the bill was passed without
                                   giving him any opportunity to examine it. The result of the bill
                                   was to leave Pike and Dubois
                                   counties out of all Judicial Circuits, out in the cold, in
                                   fact.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS also had no opportunity to examine the bill before its
                                   passage.
                              Mr. GOODING resisted the adoption of the resolution and contended
                                   that the bill can do no harm as it is a temporary thing, and as
                                   it is proposed to revise the judicial system of the State at the
                                   regular session, and there will be no court in the
                                   gentleman's county for six months to come.
                              Mr. CAVE understood the object of this bill to be to legislate
                                   Judge Laird out of the district.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved to lay the resolution on the table.
                              The motion was agreed to--yeas, 22; nays, 18.
                         
                         
                              THE BURSON CASE.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN, from the Committee on
                                        Claims, to which was referred the claim of Charles
                                   W. Stagg for $1,344, for taking shorthand notes on the Burson
                                   contested election case last session, reported in favor of
                                   allowing him $880.
                              It was referred to the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means, with instructions to incorporate the same
                                   in the specific Appropriation bill.
                         
                         
                              LEGISLATIVE JOURNALS.
                              Mr. CHAPMAN, by leave, introduced a bill [S, 105] to regulate
                                   certain matters of legislative practice in the General Assembly.
                                   Providing for the appointment of a committee at each session of
                                   the General Assembly to examine and report for correction any
                                   errors in the minutes of proceedings in either House of a
                                   committee of five from each House, of which the President and
                                   Speaker shall be chairmen, for the purpose of examining and
                                   correcting the journal when its reading is dispensed with in the
                                   House, the committee to report to the House all mistakes
                                   discovered.
                              It was read the first time.
                              On his motion the Constitutional restriction was dispensed with,
                                   and the bill was read by title for the second reading.
                              On the further motion of Mr. CHAPMAN, the bill was engrossed, read
                                   the third time and passed by yeas 35, nays 0.
                         
                         
                              FEES AND SALARIES.
                              Mr. RHODES, by leave, from the Committee on Fees and
                                        Salaries, returned the bill [S. 25] to repeal the
                                   fee and salary act, with a recommendation that it lie on the
                                   table.
                              The report was concurred in.
                         
                         
                              COUNTY PROPERTY.
                              Mr. SCOTT, by leave, introduced a bill [S. 166] for an act
                                   regulating the sale of county property and the letting and
                                   building of county buildings and the sale of county property.
                                   [Prohibiting County Commissioners from making any contract for
                                   the erection of public buildings or bridges until plans and
                                   specifications have been filed with the County Auditor, open to
                                   public inspection, nor until bids for such work have been
                                   advertised for, when it shall be let to the lowest bidder, who
                                   shall be required to give bonds for the faithful performance of
                                   his contract. It also provides that County Commissioners shall
                                   not sell any public property without first advertising the
                                   sale.]
                              It was read the second time.
                              He moved for a dispensation of the constitutional restriction that
                                   the bill may be pressed to the final reading now.
                              Objection being made--
                              Mr. SCOTT urged the adoption of his motion, reciting cases where
                                   public property has been frittered away for want of some legal
                                   restriction such as is propsed in this bill. He said, as the law
                                   now stands the County Commissioners may meet in the morning and
                                   sell off all the property of the county before noon at just such
                                   prices as they choose, and unless actual fraud is proved, the
                                   people have no remedy. They were being robbed and plundered in
                                   his county by a ring whose members are growing rich at their
                                   expense.
                              Pending action on the motion, the Senate adjourned until two
                                   o'clock.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The Senate met pursuant to adjournment.
                              The question pending being on the motion to dispense with the
                                   constitutional rule, in order that the bill may be pressed to its
                                   final vote in the Senate, it was agreed to.--Yeas, 35; nays,
                                   4.
                              Accordingly, the bill was read by title for the second reading.
                              Mr. SMITH moved to amend the bill so as to include public fences
                                   and monuments.
                              It was agreed to.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved to amend the bill so that the provisions of the
                                   bill shall not apply to buildings or bridges costing less than
                                   $500.
                              It was agreed to.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS also offered an amendment providing that the sale or
                                   letting of contracts for the building of public works, etc., be
                                   advertised for six weeks instead of ninety days.
                              
                              This amendment was also agreed to.
                              On motion of Mr. SCOTT, the bill was considered as engrossed, read
                                   the third time and passed. Yeas 41, nays 0.
                         
                         
                              SOLDIERS' WIDOWS AND ORPHANS.
                              Mr. GREGG, by leave, offered a resolution instructing our Senators
                                   in Congress to favor the passage of an act allowing widows and
                                   orphans of soldiers to acquire public lands as homesteads.
                              It was adopted. Yeas 43, nays 0.
                         
                         
                              LEGISLATIVE APPORTIONMENT BILL.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved, that the message from the House just reported
                                   informing the Senate of the passage of the bill [S. 146]
                                   redistricting the State for Senatorial and Representative
                                   purposes, with amendments thereto, be read.
                              The motion was agreed to by yeas 27, nays 18.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved, that the Senate concur in the House amendments,
                                   and upon that motion he demanded the previous question.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS demanded a call of the Senate.
                              The PRESIDENT decided that a demand for the call of the Senate is
                                   not in order pending a motion for the previous question.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS desired to appeal from the decision of the chair. The
                                   question being "shall the main question be now
                                   put?"
                              It was ordered. Yeas 27, nays 18.
                              Pending the roll-call--
                              Mr. HARNEY, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called,
                                   declared these proceedings were not fair because this is a great
                                   question--a question that will affect the State for several years
                                   to come. We ask only to fix the record correctly. All the
                                   minority ask and all they have asked is, that this question may
                                   be fairly defined and well put so that when this case is appealed
                                   to the country the country will not be at a loss to determine the
                                   issue. For the reason that this motion cuts off that privilege, I
                                   cannot vote for it. Although I am not willing to counsel any
                                   factious opposition, the right is accorded to all men that their
                                   record may be fixed so that they may appeal to that great
                                   tribunal that will settle all questions. And this is certainly
                                   right and proper. It is a right which is accorded to the
                                   murderer, whose hands are yet reeking with the blood of his
                                   victim. I appeal to Senators upon the floor--gentlemen who ask
                                   favors and we award them--
                              Mr. STEELE, (interrupting). I rise to a point of order.
                              The PRESIDENT. I hope the Senator will confine his remarks to an
                                   explanation of the reasons for his vote.
                              Mr. HARNEY. If I am not doing so it is from a lack of ability on my
                                   part, which, I think you will excuse. But I say it is right that
                                   the question upon which our appeal is made, shall be stated fair
                                   and clear. I hope no gentleman will refuse to allow us that
                                   simple right. Gentlemen need not fear the Opposition will assume
                                   a revolutionary form. They can, with safety to themselves, accord
                                   this simple right. For these reasons I oppose seconding the
                                   previous question at this time, because it cuts off all
                                   privileges of this kind; therefore, I vote
                                   "no."
                              The vote was then announced as above.
                              So the Senate seconded the demand for the previous question.
                              The question being on curcurring in the amendments of the House,
                                   they were concurred in--yeas, 27; nays, 18, as follows:

                              Pending the roll call--
                              Mr. WILLIAMS, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote
                                   adduced numerous instances in which, he said, injustice had been
                                   done the minority. For instance,the counties of Sullivan and
                                   Knox, with a population of 9,254, get no more representation than
                                   Lawrence and Munroe, with 6,648--3000 less, or very near it.
                                   Clarke and Floyd, with a population of 9,886, have one Senator
                                   and two Representatives, while Scott, Jennings and Jefferson with
                                   much less population have one Senator and three
                                   Representatives.
                              Mr. DWIGGIGS, (interposing.) Does the Senator take the publication
                                   in the Sentinel or the bill ?
                              Mr. WILLIAMS. I take the bill. It would take all the school masters
                                   in the State of Indiana to tell what representation Scott,
                                   Jennings, Jefferson, Decatur, Rush, Fayette and Union have got. I
                                   defy any Senator on this floor to tell me what representation
                                   they have. Yet we are asked to vote for this bill.
                              There is another objection to this bill. There are the counties of
                                   Shelby and Johnson. Shelby is taken from the county of Marion, so
                                   kindly, and the county of Morgan is put in its stead. Shelby and
                                   Johnson have 9,074 population by the census taken for that
                                   purpose, and then there is Parke and Vermillion, and how much do
                                        you suppose they get
                                   with 6,305 population--3,000 less? They get the same
                                   representation. Marshall, Fulton, and Pulaski have 9,164, and not
                                   very far from that spot is a place called Lake and Porter, with a
                                   population of 6,200, which gets the samd representation, with the
                                   exception that Marshall has a float with St. Joseph. Allen, Wells
                                   and Adams, get three Senators and two Representatives with a
                                   population equal to the county of Marion, and what does it get.
                                   Who can figure up what it gets? I say it gets eight--three more
                                   than the counties of Allen, Adams and Wells. I vote
                                   "no."
                              The vote was then announced as above recorded.
                              So the bill [S. 146] apportioning the Senators and Representatives
                                   among the several counties of the State, was passed the Senate as
                                   amended yesterday by the House of Representatives, as
                                   follows:

                              SECTION 3. That the Representatives shall be

                              Mr. NEFF, by leave, reported from the Committee favorably on Claims
                                   for the Daily Evening Commercial, furnished last session $30,
                                   which was referred to the Committee on Finance
                                   for incorporation in the specific appropriation bill.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS now submitted another appeal from the decision of the
                                   chair, signed by himself and Mr. Carnahan, reciting that when Mr.
                                   DWIGGINS made a demand for the previous question on concurring in
                                   the House amendments to the bill [S. 146], the Senator from Knox
                                   demanded a call of the Senate which was decided out of order by
                                   the chair. They appeal from this decision of the chair.
                              The PRESIDENT. The appeal, as I understand it, don't
                                   recite the facts. The motion was made by the Senator, from
                                   Jasper, (Mr. Dwiggins) as therein recited, and the chair rose for
                                   the purpose of stating the question to the Senate as it was the
                                   duty of the chair, the Senator from Knox (Mr. Williams) demanded
                                   a call of the Senate. The chair decided that out of order as it
                                   was the duty of the chair to state the question to the Senate
                                   before any other matter was entertained.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS and Mr. WILLIAMS addressed the chair.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS. The chair can't deal in that way with
                                   me.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS. I have the floor.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS. I don't think that the Senator from Jasper
                                   (Mr. Dwiggins) has the floor.
                              The PRESIDENT. I have decided that the Senator from Jasper has the
                                   floor.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS, I demand that the question on the appeal be put.
                              The PRESIDENT. The Senator from Jasper has the floor. I am not
                                   going to put the question on the appeal until it recites the
                                   facts.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS. It does recite the facts and the chair knows it.
                              The PRESIDENT. The Senator from Knox will take his seat.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS. The Senator from Knox will not be ruled down in that
                                   way.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS. I want the appeal presented to the Senate when the
                                   facts are properly set forth. The facts are these: The clerk of
                                   the House reported a message and I moved to take up that message
                                   and it was decided in the affirmative. The Secretary read the
                                   amendments, and this appeal states that I moved to take up the
                                   bill. I didn't make any such motion. I moved to concur
                                   in the amendments, and demanded the previous question, and that
                                   was concurred in.
                              
                              Mr. ORR. I rise to a point of order. What is before the Senate?
                              Mr. PRESIDENT. There is a paper sent up, purporting to be an appeal
                                   from the decision of the chair.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS. It contains the facts in the case.
                              Mr. ORR. I understand that the President wouldn't
                                   recognize it.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS. I desire that the question shall be presented as soon
                                   as it is properly brought forward and recites the facts. The
                                   Senate will agree that it does not because I--
                              Mr. WILLIAMS (interposing). I call the Senator to order. The chair
                                   has decided not to entertain the appeal. I demand that the appeal
                                   shall be put on the journal.
                              Mr. BROWN. I don't believe there is anything in our rules
                                   upon the subject of appeals, but parliamentary law recognizes the
                                   right of a member to appeal from a decision of the Chair, and I
                                   don't think we ought to criticise the language very
                                   closely. If an appeal does not recite the facts that is one
                                   reason why it ought not to be sustained. We had better let the
                                   appeal go upon the records and take a vote upon it. There is not
                                   enough in a matter of this kind to have a serious contention
                                   about. I don't think it sets out the facts as it ought
                                   to, but I think the Chair should put the question on the appeal
                                   to the Senate.
                              The PRESIDENT. At the request of Senators I will state the
                                   question: "Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the
                                   judgment of the Senate?"
                              Mr. WILLIAMS. Will the Chair allow me to read the parliamentary law
                                   on the subject. I read from Jefferson's Manual, page
                                   144. [Mr. W. reads.] Now, if Senators can sustain the decision of
                                   the Chair in the face of this parliamentary law, they can do
                                   it--that's all I have to say about it.
                              Mr. BROWN. The Senator from Knox (Mr. Williams) is a good
                                   parliamentarian and generally correct, but this time he is very
                                   far from being correct. The Senator reads from a work on
                                   parliamentary law based on the rules of the House of
                                   Representatives of the United States. They are not the rules of
                                   this body. There is nothing in the rules of this body upon the
                                   subject of a call of the House. The general parliamentary law is
                                   that when a presiding officer decides a question any two members
                                   thinking the decision not right may take an appeal; but the
                                   Senator has no right to demand a call of the Senate. The law of
                                   parliament never did give one member the right to demand a call
                                   of the House. The decision of the Chair was right, and inasmuch
                                   as no good is to be accomplished I move that the appeal lie on
                                   the table.
                              The motion was agreed to by yeas ---, nays ---.
                         
                         
                              CLAIMS.
                              Mr. NEFF, from the Committee on Claims, returned
                                   the claim of T. A. Goodwin for $24 60 for copies of the American
                                   furnished last session.
                              Also, the claim of the Senate Committee on
                                        Prisons in making two trips to the Southern Prison
                                   last session, allowing each $30 for expenses incurred.
                              Also, the claim of the Committee on Military
                                        Affairs for going to Dayton, Ohio last session, of
                                   $30 each.
                              These claims were referred to the Committee on
                                        Finance, with instructions to incorporate the same
                                   in the specific appropriation bill.
                         
                         
                              FEMALE PRISON.
                              On motion by Mr. BROWN, the bill [H. R. 211] supplemental to the
                                   act establishing the Female Reformatory
                                   Institution--appropriating $50,000 for finishing and furnishing
                                   the buildings, and putting in order the grounds--was read the
                                   first time.
                              Mr. CARNAHAN, from the Committee on
                                   Corporations, returned the bill [S. 122] to legalize
                                   appropriations made previous to May 12, 1869, in aid of railroads
                                   by County Commissioners, recommending its passage.
                              The report was concurred in.
                         
                         
                              TWENTY-SECOND COMMON PLEAS COURT.
                              Mr. ROSEBRUGH. by leave, introduced a bill [S. 167] fixing the
                                   times of holding the Court of Common Pleas in Ripley county,
                                   which was read the first time.
                              On his further motion, the constitutional restriction was dispensed
                                   with. Yeas 39, nays 3.
                              The bill was read by tftle for the second reading, by sections the
                                   third time, and passed. Yeas 45. nays 0.
                         
                         
                              COMMITTEE REPORTS.
                              Mr. BROWN, by leave, returned from the Judiciary
                                        Committee the Wayne county county seat bill [H. R.
                                   227] with a recommendation that it go upon the files.
                              Also that the bill [S. 134] to give the Prosecuting Attorney the
                                   opening and close in criminal cases, be laid on the table because
                                   a House Bill pending accomplishes the same result.
                              Also that the bill [S, 161] upon the subject of postponing the
                                   collection of rail- road
                                   taxes, in certain cases, be laid on the table, because the same
                                   is covered by other bills now pending.
                              Also that the bill [S. 180] to revise, simplify and abridge the
                                   rules of pleading and practice in civil cases, be passed.
                              Also that the bill ]H. R. 385] to authorize aid to railroads by
                                   counties and townships, be passed.
                              Also that the bill [H. R. 7] providing that; Justices of the Peace
                                   shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction in certain cases
                                   of misdemeanors be laid on the table.
                              The reports were concurred in.
                         
                         
                              PRACTICE IN CRIMINAL CASES.
                              Mr. BROWN, from the same Committee, reported back the bill [H. R.
                                   137] to revise, simplify and abridge the rules of practice and
                                   pleading in certain casas, with amendments, the majority of the
                                   committee recommending that the bill be laid on the table, and
                                   the minority that after the adoption of the amendments the bill
                                   be passed. The amendments provide that in criminal cases the
                                   prosecuting attorney shall have the opening and close of the
                                   argument, except that by consent of both parties the argument may
                                   be waived. The prosecuting attorney shall disclose in his opening
                                   all the points relied on in the case, and if, in the closing, he
                                   refer to any new point or fact not disclosed in the opening, the
                                   defendant or his counsel shall have the right of replying
                                   thereto, which reply shall close the argument in the case. If the
                                   prosecuting attorney shall refuse to open the argument, the
                                   defendant or his counsel may then argue the case, and that shall
                                   be all the argument allowed in the case. At the conclusion of the
                                   argument the Court shall charge the jury, which charge, upon the
                                   request of either party, made before the commencement of the
                                   argument, shall be in writing. If either party desire special
                                   instructions to the jury, they shall be reduced to writing and
                                   delivered to the Court before the commencement of the
                                   argument.
                              Mr. STEELE moved to lay the whole subject on the table.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                         
                         
                              HUNTING AND SHOOTING.
                              Mr. BROWN, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                   returned the hunting and shooting--on enclosed lands--bill, with
                                   amendments, inserting the words "by the consent
                                   of" the owner, prosecutions may be instituted.
                              It was concurred in.
                              Mr. BROWN, by direction of the committee, offered a resolution
                                   requiring the keeping of the committee rooms on Judiciary
                                   railroads and Federal relations during the recess, by the
                                   door-keeper.
                              It was adopted.
                         
                         
                              ORPHANS' HOME.
                              On motion of Mr. THOMPSON, the bill [S. 48] changing the name of
                                   the Soldiers' Home, at Knightstown, Rush county, so it
                                   shall be called the Indiana Soldier's Orphans'
                                   Home, and making appropriations for new buildings, was taken up
                                   and read the third time.
                              Mr. THOMPSON, (the Chairman of the Committee on Benevolent
                                        Institutions) spoke as follows :
                              Mr. President: Upon an invitation from the Superintendent and
                                   Trustees of the Soldiers' Orphans' Home,
                                   situated at Knightstown Springs, a part of your
                                        committee on Benevolent Institutions, in
                                   company with other members of the Legislature, visited the Home
                                   and desire to lay before the Senate the results of their
                                   observations. There are two hundred and twenty-five children in
                                   this Home. They are from an parts of the State, and are all the
                                   children of soldiers who fell while fighting on the battle fields
                                   during our late civil war, or died in military prisons or in
                                   hospitals of diseases contracted while in the army, or whose
                                   fathers, crippled for life are in some of the National
                                   Soldiers' Homes. Their ages range from two years of age
                                   to fourteen. The children appeared well cared for--being well
                                   clad, well fed, and very happy. Those of them, who were old
                                   enough, are employed in mechanic shops at very light work, or are
                                   in school, certain portions of the day. Young and old exhibitited
                                   a commendable ambition in prosecuting the duties assigned them in
                                   the school rooms and in the workshops. Among the most noticeable
                                   and praiseworthy features of those children, were there excellent
                                   order and strict attention to the government of the institution
                                   and their very affectionate regard for the Superintendent and
                                   their teachers--whom young and old appeared to treat as parents.
                                   The whole government of this Home appears to be perfect and
                                   executed in a paternal manner that commands our unqualified
                                   admiration. These grounds on which the Home is established were a
                                   gift to the State by a few generous souls for the purposes of a
                                   home for soldiers and their children. The soldiers who were here,
                                   who have not died, have been removed to Dayton, to the National
                                   Home, leaving only these children to be cared for. The main
                                   building is one of the most substantial, convenient and airy
                                   buildings in the State, securiug plenty of light and ven- tilation in every room. The
                                   Trustees take the liveliest interest in the children. Among
                                   others, Mr. Hannaman, who devotes much of his attention without
                                   recompense to looking after the welfare of these helpless little
                                   ones, deserves the gratitude of every friend to humanity.
                              Mr. HARNEY said that while he was in favor of an institution for
                                   the care of soldiers' orphans, he did not believe that
                                   the State was a grand eleemosynary institution. The number of
                                   soldiers' orphans would be constantly decreasing, and
                                   therefore he did not see the necessity of increasing the capacity
                                   of the institution. The main feature of the bill is the provision
                                   for the care of orphans other than soldiers' orphans at
                                   an increased charge of from two to three dollars per week. He
                                   thought the County Commissioners could care for the orphans at
                                   less than the latter figure, and did not believe the effort to
                                   establish a State Orphan Asylum to be sustained by State taxation
                                   would succeed. He was in favor of maintaining the institution as
                                   it now is, but not of extending its era. He disliked to oppose
                                   anything that looked like benevolence, but did not think this a
                                   proper time to increase expenses. It is a time for economy and
                                   retrenchment. Few of us can afford to increase the expenses of
                                   our domestic affairs fifty per cent., as is proposed in this bill
                                   to do by this institution. The pictrue the Senator (Mr. Thompson)
                                   has drawn is calculated to move our feelings and sympathies, but
                                   the money proposed to be appropriated is drawn by taxation from
                                   the poor and from all classes of society, and it is our duty to
                                   exercise great care in expending it.
                              Mr. SLEETH said the provisions of the bill were: first, that
                                   soldiers' orphans shall be cared for; and second, after
                                   this class is provided for, if there is room left, total orphans
                                   may be admitted on the application of the commissioners of the
                                   county from which they come, provided their expenses are paid, so
                                   that no expense will be entailed upon the State thereby. In a few
                                   years the orphans of soldiers will have grown up and passed out
                                   from the institution. The building will still be left, and the
                                   question is whether total orphans in the several counties of the
                                   State shall be sent to the county poor house or to this
                                   institution, where they will be taught a trade and subjected to
                                   better influences and receive better care than they possibly can
                                   at a poor house. As no expense will be entailed upon the State by
                                   the bill, and as the orphans will undoubtedly be better cared for
                                   there than elsewhere, he couldsee no objections to the passage of
                                   the bill.
                              Mr. STEELE inquired the necessity for the increased charge of one
                                   dollar per week for the keeping of the children at the Home.
                              Mr. THOMPSON responded that the expenses of the Home had heretofore
                                   been partly borne by private donations.
                              Mr. NEFF said he did not believe it should be the policy of the
                                   people of Indiana to barely keep the souls and bodies of these
                                   orphans together. If we call it a Home, let us make it a home, by
                                   making a reasonable appropriation for its maintenance.
                              The bill was passed the third and last reading by yeas 42, nays
                                   2.
                              The following is a synopsis of the bill [S. 48] to amend an act
                                   entitled "An act to establish a home for disabled
                                   Indiana soldiers, their orphans and Widows, at Knightstown
                                   Springs." Approved, March 11, 1867, and an act
                                   supplemental thereto, approved, May, 14, 1869.
                              Section 1 of said act of March 11, 1867, provides for the admission
                                   of disabled Indiana soldiers, and their orphans and widows.
                              Section 1 of this bill repeals all that part referring to the
                                   admission of Soldiers and Widows, and provides for the admission
                                   of Orphans only, and changes the name to "Indiana
                                   Soldiers' Orphans' Home"
                              Section 7 of said act of March 11, 1867, defines what class of
                                   Soldiers, Orphans and Widows shall be admitted.
                              Section 2 of this bill repeals all that part of Section 7 relating
                                   to the admission of Soldiers and Widows, and provides that
                                   orphans of deceased soldiers under twelve years of age, without
                                   father or mother, and with mother living, shall be admitted,
                                   provided that no one who has the means of support shall be
                                   admitted.
                              Section 3 of this bill provides that when there shall be room in
                                   the Home not required for Soldiers Orphans, that other total
                                   orphan children shall be admitted upon application of County
                                   Commissioners, approved by Board of Trustees of the Home.
                              Section 2 of Supplemental act, approved May 14, 1869, provides for
                                   the payment of $2 00 per week for each inmate and person for
                                   current expenses, and how it shall be paid.
                              Section 4 of this bill provides for the payment of $3 00 per week
                                   for each inmate and person for current expenses, payable on the
                                   order of the Superintendent, indorsed by the Governor, the
                                   Auditor shall draw his warrant on the Treasurer for the amount

                              Mr. SMITH offered the following:

                                             RESOLVED, That the President of
                                                  the Senate be requested to procure a minister to
                                                  hold divine service in the Senate on said day, and
                                                  that the Senate thereafter adjourn sine die.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              It was adopted.
                         
                         
                              RAILROAD AID ACT.
                              On motion by Mr. BEARDSLEY, the bill [H. R. 235] supplemental to
                                   the county and township railroad aid act of May 12, 1869, was
                                   read the second time, and under a dispensation of the
                                   constitutional restrictions, the third time, and passed by yeas
                                   36, nays 0.
                         
                         
                              EXPENSES FOR CHANGE OF VENUE.
                              On motion by Mr. GREGG, the bill [H. R. 139] relating to expenses
                                   incurred by one county by change of venue from another, the
                                   county from which the change of venue shall be taken to pay all
                                   expenses incurred by such county consequent upon such change of
                                   venue, was read the second time and laid upon the table.
                              And then they adjourned till ten o'clock to-morrow
                                   morning.

                         HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                         
                              THURSDAY, December 19, 1872.
                         
                         The SPEAKER directed the reading of the Journal of yesterday, which was
                              dispensed with.
                         The SPEAKER resumed the unfinished business of yesterday, viz. : Mr.
                              Martin's bill, [H. R. 76] to amend sections 1,2, 4, 6, 11 and
                              12 of the private drainage act of 1867, the question being on the
                              third reading.
                         Mr. BUTTERWORTH. This bill proposes to amend the law of 1867, for
                              draining operations by private parties, and there is great need of it,
                              especially in the northern part of the State. It provides that the
                              land owner who is subject to assessment under it, shall have ten
                              days' notice, and shall be heard in the matter of the
                              appraisement; it requires the petitioner or applicant to give him
                              notice; that the appraisers, or any two of them, shall go through and
                              examine all the lands to be affected, whether described in the
                              applicant's petition or not; and where there has been a
                              failure from any cause in the matter coming to the knowledge of the
                              owner, it shall be the the duty of the applicant to cause a copy of
                              such assessment to be served on the owner. And if the owner is not
                              satisfied, it shall be the duty of the applicant to notify all the
                              parties and proceed to a re-examination and re-assessment of the same,
                              and report his assessment to the County Recorder for record, and the
                              Recorder's charge for the record, of twenty-five cents a
                              tract, is reduced after the first four tracts. He called special
                              attention to the provisions of the 9th section of the bill. Under the
                              present law the petitioner has to bear the entire expense of the
                              proposed work, and can't collect one cent of the assessments
                              till the whole of the work is done. This section provides that when a
                              part of the drain shall have been completed, and the land owner
                              receives all the benefit of the drain as though the whole were
                              completed, then the assessments on such lands are collectable.
                         Mr. LENFESTY. But the other day the gentleman from St. Joseph was
                              against all drainage laws.
                         Mr. BUTTERWORTH interposed to say that he was always heartily in favor
                              of good drainage laws.
                         Mr. LENFESTY then referred to an understanding with the friends of the
                              repeal of the Kankakee act, that if that were repealed the
                              "Chapman bill" from the Senate should receive
                              attention. But when the Chapman bill came from the Senate and it was
                              referred to the committee of which the gentlemen is chairman, it
                              remained there and has not been heard of since.
                         Mr. BUTTERWORTH. The Chapman bill has never been before the Swamp Lands
                              Committee.
                         Mr. RUMSEY favored the bill, but was opposed to carrying it to the final
                              vote at this time. He moved that it be referred to the Judiciary
                              Committee.
                         The SPEAKER. There is objection; and it cannot be referred without
                              instruction at this stage of the bill.
                         Mr. GREGORY wished to say to those who have not examined it, that this
                              is a good bill. It was well known that in the northern part of the State we have to
                              depend very much on drainage to redeem some of the best soil in the
                              world; and, perhaps, the only way we can do this work effectually will
                              be by the organization of companies, and by legislating for amendment
                              of this "one man's drainage law" to that
                              end. He thought that both this bill and the Chapman bill ought to
                              pass, so that the latter shall not give too much power to the
                              corporators. This bill takes the act of 1867, and puts additional
                              restrictions upon the powers conferred by it. It simply and only
                              confers the power on any man so that he may go on the land of another
                              and make an outlet for his ditch. It does not provide for
                              corporations. I believe that I am just as much in earnest for the
                              passage of the Chapman bill as I am for this.
                         Mr. HELLER was in favor of good drainage laws. We have 40,000 acres that
                              must be drained in Allen county, and I hope gentlemen will withdraw
                              their objections and let this bill pass.
                         Mr. LENFESTY adhered to his objections to the bill. Gentlemen are
                              endeavoring to pass a bill that is not understood by the House. We
                              have as much land that needs draining in Grant county as in any other
                              county in tke State, and we have done some of our best work under the
                              Kankakee Drainage Act. He spoke for the Chapman bill, and for delay as
                              to the passage of this pending bill till it can be understood.
                         Mr. GLASGOW. There is one provision in this bill which (as he thought)
                              is quite as bad as tke Kankakee act which we have repealed. I think it
                              provides that the benefits shall be assessed without regard to the
                              cost cof the work; and that these assessments may be collected at the
                              rate of ten per cent, per month. True, the parties are required to
                              give bonds, but they may use the money and bank upon it.
                         Mr. BUTTERWORTH. There is no such provision in the bill.
                         Mr. KIRKPATRICK. Section 12 (lines 11 to 24) authorizes the person who
                              holds land above, to deepen and widen the old drains; and if his ditch
                              is four miles long it will occupy about eighty acres of land. I would
                              like to have the bill referred back with instructions to strike out
                              the 12th section.
                         Mr. BUTTERWORTH. That is the law now. It is the law of 1867.
                         Mr. KIRKPATRICK. I care not. Our object is to secure and accommodate
                              interests all over the State. That is the very principle upon which we
                              repealed the Kankakee drainage law.
                         Mr. ANDERSON also objected to the passage of the bill.
                         Mr. GREGORY defended the provision objected to by Mr. Kirkpatrick. It
                              was a good and necessary provision where too much water has been let
                              into the ditch for its capacity.
                         The final vote was taken and reported--yeas, 42; nays, 33.
                         So the bill failed for want of the constitutional majority of 51.
                         
                              SUNDAY A LEGISLATIVE DAY.
                              Mr. BRANHAM submitted a resolution for an order that this House
                                   will pass no bill this session after this day.
                              Mr. HARDESTY moved to lay it on the table, but immediately withdrew
                                   the motion.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. The ablest lawyers I have consulted agree with me that
                                   we can't pass bills after to-night under the
                                   Constitution. I suppose all are aware that the forty days for
                                   this session terminate on Sunday. If it were absolutely
                                   necessary, and the House were willing to meet on Sunday and
                                   legalize our acts on Friday, I might be willing. But all the
                                   business of the session will pass into the next and be considered
                                   in order there, and there is no such necessity. And I submit
                                   whether it is prudent to pass laws without regard to the
                                   constitutional provision, which forbids the passage of any bill
                                   within two days of the adjournment of the session.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, made no question of the right of the General
                                   Assembly to pass bills on Friday.
                              Mr. KIMBALL read from a note received by him from the Governor:
                                   "I have no doubt of the right of the General Assembly to
                                   pass bills up to twelve o'clock Friday
                                   night."
                              Mr. BRANHAM. I have made no inquiry with reference to this matter
                                   from a political stand point. I put it upon this: I do not think
                                   the House ought to make a legislative day of Sunday; and if we do
                                   not, then we will not pass any bill after to-night. If there were
                                   any pressing necessity we might do it, but there is none. And I
                                   say, if the General Assembly requires all the people to observe
                                   that day, we ought to observe it as well.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY. An effort has been made here to provide other days
                                   besides Sunday, to be observed by abstinence from business; and
                                   as a question of consistency he would not require the Governor to
                                   work on Sunday, especially when there is no necessity for it--and
                                   all Christian people observe that day. And if we consider it as a
                                   legal proposition we find that Sunday is not observed as a day of
                                        business; as, in the
                                   maturity of commercial paper and bills of exchange, and in the
                                   service of legal process, we have no right to count Sunday. When
                                   the last day of the paper comes on Sunday, you are required to
                                   protest it on Saturday.
                              Mr. WALKER. The gentleman from Jefferson (Mr. Branham) proceeds on
                                   the hypothesis that it is attempted to make Sunday a legislative
                                   day. But that is not the intention, for Sunday is now a
                                   legislative day, and the gentleman from Jefferson (unless he has
                                   remitted it) has drawn his per diem for every Sunday since the
                                   session commenced.
                              Mr. BRANHAM (in his seat). I have not drawn a dollar.
                              Mr. WALKER, Still, unless he remits it he will get five dollars a
                                   day for every Sunday, and in contemplation of law it is a
                                   legislative day. The Governor says in his letter that the session
                                   closes on Sundaythat is a constitutional point--and he says the
                                   practice has included that day.
                              Mr. BRANHAM, If the House should make a bill on Sunday, would it be
                                   valid?
                              Mr. WALKER. Yes, probably, it would. But we have higher authority
                                   The Congress of the United States sits on Sunday, when occasion
                                   requires; and it did so under the advice and instructions of old
                                   John Quincy Adams. Then, unless the gentleman gives some good
                                   reason why we should exempt that day, we can't do so.
                                   The gentleman from Morgan and Johnson (Mr. Shirley) refers to the
                                   legal requirements in regard to bills of exchange, that proceeds
                                   from legislation. We here derive our authority from the
                                   Constitution. If the gentleman from Jefferson wishes to go home,
                                   he certainly can do so.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. In order to relieve gentlemen from the bitings of
                                   conscience in this matter, we might order a sermon for the day,
                                   and then close our business and adjourn sine die.
                              The SPEAKER announced that the hour has arrived for the
                                   consideration of the Special Order.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. I would be glad for the House to dispense with the
                                   special order till we can dispose of this resolution.
                              The SPEAKER. Will the House consent?
                              It was so ordered on a division.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. I demand the yeas and nays on the adoption of the
                                   resolution.
                              The yeas and nays were ordered.
                              Mr. COWGILL. So far as the legality is concerned, in the absence of
                                   any statutory prohibition we can make contracts, pass laws, or do
                                   anything of that kind. But there is a statutory prohibition in
                                   regard to making contracts and bills of exchange, and none
                                   against passing laws on Sunday. Then we can count Sunday and pass
                                   laws till 12 o'clock Friday night.
                              Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. I would be glad to give my influence for the
                                   proper observance of the Sabbath day. But I propose to give
                                   higher authority for continuing our legislation through this day
                                   of the week than has yet been offered. We find this written
                                   saying by the Lord of the Sabbath: "Will not a man, if
                                   his ox or his ass fall into the ditch, straightway take him out
                                   on the Sabbath day?"
                              Mr, BLOCHER. I do not think it is right for a man to be trying all
                                   the week to push his ox or his ass into the ditch, and then make
                                   a Sunday job of getting him out. [Laughter.]
                              Mr. KIMBALL. As the question is directly on the adoption of the
                                   resolution, if the gentleman from Jefferson will promise me that
                                   we shall take up and consider the apportionment bill without
                                   delay, I will do what I can to accommodate him in this.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. I have no reference at all to any particular
                                   legislation.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. As far as this business is concerned, it ought to be
                                   done, so that we may come to the next session without I any issue
                                   that will create ill-feeling. I am anxious, therefore, to dispose
                                   of it at once, and, as the Governor has expressed himself willing
                                   to consider and sign bills on the Sabbath day, I hope gentlemen
                                   will consider this matter and vote on it, not in a partisan
                                   light, but for the good of the State.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. I introduced the resolution at the suggestion of the
                                   gentleman from Marion.
                              Mr. THOMPSON, of Elkhart, I move that it be made in the form of a
                                   concurrent resolution.
                              Mr. BRANHAM accepted the modification.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, I move to lay the resolution on the
                                   table.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. As this is setting a precedent, I demand the yeas and
                                   nays on the motion to lay it on the table.
                              The yeas and nays were ordered accordingly, and being taken
                                   resulted--yeas 47, nays 43--as follows:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             YEAS--Messrs. Baxter,
                                                  Billingsley, Blocher, Broadus, Butterworth, Butts,

                                             NAYS--Messrs. Anderson, Baker,
                                                  Barrett, Bowser Branham Brett, Cauthorn, Claypool,

                                                  of Spencer, Tulley, Whitworth, Willard and
                                                  Woollen--44.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              So the resolution was laid on the table.
                              Mr. KIMBALL desired unanimous consent to enable him to report from
                                   the Committee on Ways and Means their
                                   amendments to the specific bill [H. R, 259].
                              The SPEAKER. It will displace the special order.
                         
                         
                              APPORTIONMENT FOR REPRESENTATION.
                              The SPEAKER now announced the special order, viz.: the
                                   consideration of the bill [S. 54] to divide the State into
                                   Congressional Districts. The bill having been read--
                              Mr. KIMBALL moved that it be made the special order to-morrow
                                   morning ten o'clock.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. I move to amend the motion so as to make it the
                                   special order for the second day of the next session. I think we
                                   ought not to sustain this bill; but I suppose it will be
                                   done.
                              Mr. JOHNSON. I move to lay the motion of the gentleman, from
                                   Johnson, on the table.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. Then I withdraw the motion as a matter of course.
                              Mr. GLASGOW. If it is in order, I propose the following amendment
                                   to the bill. (The amendment was read by the Clerk. It proposes to
                                   strike out sections 8 to 15, and insert section 3 embracing
                                   another apportionment.)
                              The SPEAKER. The chair decides that, according to the rules, the
                                   motion to make the bill the special order has precedence.
                              And then Mr. Kimball's motion was agreed to, and the bill
                                   was made the special order for to-morrow morning at 10
                                   o'clock.
                         
                         
                              LEGISLATIVE APPORTIONMENT.
                              The SPEAKER then announced the other branch of the special order,
                                   viz.: the bill [S. 146] to fix the number of Senators and
                                   Representatives of the State of Indiana, and to apportion the
                                   same among the several counties.
                              Mr. BAKER was under the impression that we are taking a too hurried
                                   step, pressing this bill through this session. This apportionment
                                   will virtually disfranchise sixty-five thousand of the legal
                                   voters of the State. He stood politically unprejudiced, while he
                                   urged a careful consideration of the bill, and stood ready to do
                                   justice to both sides. For himself he would prefer to postpone
                                   the bill till the regular session. Having done his best to
                                   examine it, he had come to the conclusion that it is one of the
                                   most unjust measures ever proposed in the State. But as he was of
                                   the minority he could do no more than make his protest against
                                   the passage of the bill.
                              Mr. FURNAS. I feel the delicacy of this question. But there are
                                   always two sides to every question. It sounds like a a big thing
                                   to charge the disfranchisement of sixty-five thousand
                                   people--Democrats and yet this bill disfranchises ten or twelve
                                   thousand on the opposite side. There are at least three thousand
                                   in the county of Marion disfranchised on the opposite side. I
                                   might be scared at this bill if I had not been here two years
                                   ago, when a much worse measure was introduced
                              Mr BARRETT. What did the gentleman do when that bill was
                                   introduced?
                              Mr, FURNAS. I staid here. [Laughter.]
                              Mr. KIMBALL, Gentlemen who oppose this bill, in years gone by when
                                   they were making apportionments for legislative purposes, did not
                                   take it into consideration whether Republican counties were
                                   disfranchised or not. All through theri bill iniquity was found
                                   to exist. Now we come before the House with a bill giving a
                                   proper representation--a bill in which no party is disfranchised.
                                   It is true that strong appeals are made, and the words of the
                                   gentleman from Johnson (Mr. Woollen) entered into my heart; but
                                   this bill is Republican, and, as the gentleman says, there is no
                                   democratic party, no man can complain as a democrat. We stand
                                   here representing the people of the State of Indiana, and in
                                   order to make equal laws the Republican party hold it to be their
                                   duty to apportion the State so that no party can get into power
                                   to undo what that glorious party have done. All the objections of
                                   the minority here are merely for the purpose of exciting the
                                   House to distrust and doubt. But, gentlemen should not forget
                                   that, if there is favor one way, there must favor in another way;
                                   and in looking over this bill it will be seen that the
                                   Republicans loose nearly as large a number of votes as the
                                   opposition. If we take the county of Marion, we have a surplus of
                                   nearly three thousand votes.
                              Mr. BRETT, (interposing). How many votes are required for a
                                   representative?
                              Mr. KIMBALL. Three thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven.
                              Mr. BRETT. How many in the county of Marion?
                              Mr. KIMBALL. Seventeen thousand--three representatives and a float
                                   uniting with the county of Shelby, and other sim- ilar cases of Republican loss will
                                   be found by casting your eyes over the State. He had been
                                   admonished that he might injure himself here. He cared not for
                                   himself--standing as a representative of the people. The will of
                                   the people is expressed in this bill, and living or dying I will
                                   stand by it; and I stand by my party; and I defy any man in the
                                   United States to point to anything here that can work any injury
                                   to that party. It is our duty to act independently without being
                                   deterred by threats come from what quarter soever they may. Mr.
                                   Speaker, the Republican party in the days gone by have stood
                                   shoulder to shoulder in bringing about those results which have
                                   made its history glorious. I will remember the positions taken by
                                   them and the character of the opposition they encountered, yet in
                                   spite of all and through a fierce war they triumphed; they
                                   preserved the Union, and the country has been the gainer by them
                                   in all respects. Then, in order to do good to mankind, and to
                                   glorify God himself, the Republican party should be kept in the
                                   majority.
                              Mr. ANDERSON was sorry to see the dominant party on this floor
                                   coming forward and without any appreciable evasion of the fact
                                   that the State is proposed to be districted unfairly, asserting
                                   that considering the great merits and services of the Republican
                                   party, and in deference to the past, and to the future benefits
                                   to be showered by it upon the country, it must be continued in
                                   power! But where is the benefit of Republican rule? Is it in this
                                   legislation? All its speakers here call it a noble party, and
                                   therefore legislate for its perpetuity! Has it come to this? I
                                   appeal to gentlemen of the majority: I persume that there is not
                                   one of you but is pondering in his mind, that this is districting
                                   the State for a purpose. You are told plainly, that it is to prop
                                   the party. Now let me call attention to some of its general
                                   features. First--as to the Senatorial representation. Add the
                                   totals together of the counties districted for the purpose of
                                   returning Democratic Senators, and take the average constituency
                                   as at the late Governor election, and you will have 8,573 for the
                                   constituency for each man that can be retained here as a
                                   Democratic Senator. Then take the average of those districts
                                   designed for Republican Senators, and you have it 7,422--making a
                                   difference of 1,152 against each one of the Democratic Senators.
                                   I should think that Republicans would not like to come here
                                   knowing that they do not represent so large a constituency as the
                                   Democrats. But gentlemen will apportion to increase their
                                   numbers, forgetting that they diminish the dignity of the
                                   position by decreasing the constituency. And if there is no
                                   Democratic party, this becomes an act against the people of
                                   Indiana. I hope it has not come to this--that partisans wish to
                                   place themselves in power where they are not supported by the
                                   majority. But it is plainly conceded, that the whole of the
                                   effort in passing this bill is, that the minority may rulethat
                                   they may always keep down the majority--that they may so make the
                                   apportionment that it will take an overwhelming voice to change
                                   the representation. He then went into his figures to show the
                                   injustice of the bill toward the county of Cass, with 5,866
                                   voters, one Representative, and combined with the county of
                                   Carroll for a Senator, whilst the county of Randolph, voting only
                                   5,014 voters, has a Representative and a Senator. Then, Scott,
                                   Jefferson and Jennings have three Representatives, and a Senator
                                   in combination; these three counties have but 1,629 votes more
                                   than would entitle them each to one Representative; and not one
                                   of them has so large a voting population as his county (Cass),
                                   which has no float. Then he called special attention to the
                                   representation for the counties of Ripley, Decatur and Rush; to
                                   these he had made his figures. Rush has 4,137 votes, Decatur
                                   4,402, Ripley 4,300, making in all 12,839 votes. These counties
                                   are each entitled to one Representative, and jointly to one more,
                                   whilst the over plus so entitling them to one Representative is
                                   only 1,629 votes. Those were the counties to which he was calling
                                   attention instead of Scott, Jefferson and Jennings.
                              Now, I think it is apparent to every man that this is trifling with
                                   the right of representation. But this is no trifling subject. I
                                   know that politicians and parties in times past have sought
                                   advantages of this kind. But it is high time now (or it ought to
                                   be) for this Legislature to adopt a different policy. I believe
                                   that this policy is wrong, and that the sooner we go right
                                   honestly and fairly to work to allow the people a fair
                                   representation the better it will be for us all. I do not believe
                                   there is anything to be gained permanently by this kind of
                                   management. It certainly is not creditable to any man so to vote
                                   as to establish it as a historical fact, that a party barely in
                                   the majority seeks and asks such an advantage as this. There is
                                   nothing creditable about it. Now, I am like many others on thi
                                   floor. I can see no necessity for rushing this matter through at
                                   the present session. It is expected that when a bill of this kind
                                   is presented the minority
                                   will vote against it; but still the bill should be a fair one. I
                                   will say again that I can see no reason why its partisan friends
                                   should not trust the bill to timely consideration. Gentlemen will
                                   retain the power they now have through the regular session, and I
                                   can see no reason why it should not be deferred, if they are not
                                   afraid of anything. This is the mind of the minority honestly and
                                   candidly--
                              Mr. KIMBALL. Those of us who have a different opinion are just as
                                   honest as the gentleman.
                              Mr. ANDERSON. I do not wish to impugn the honor of any man; but
                                   what I mean to say is this; that there are members who are not
                                   conversant with the merits of this bill, but who are expected to
                                   support it and vote for such legislation--induced so to do by
                                   partizan feeling--without taking the trouble and the time to
                                   satisfy themselves of its correctness This I believe, and am
                                   frank to say it, is often the case, Now all that could be lost by
                                   allowing the bill to lie over, would be more than compensated by
                                   the correction of some of its flagrant errors--errors which are
                                   against the people of the State of Indiana. Therefore I ask
                                   gentlemen again to take a little more time. I have no objection
                                   to their arranging the whole job, so as to give themselves a
                                   just, advantage; but I do have objection to any bill that would
                                   require, for some localities, a so much larger constituency than
                                   for others. I object to a bill that will give a floating
                                   representative to a county with 4,200 votes and deny a float to
                                   another county with 5,800 voters. I think these things are so
                                   glaringly wrong that they should be corrected.
                              Mr. BARRETT, I shall detain the House with but a few remarks. I
                                   have nothing to say about Republicans and Democrats--not a word.
                                   I would speak for my people--the people of a county of the fifth
                                   grade as to wealth in the State--a county that when the rebellion
                                   broke out responded in full to every call that was made upon her,
                                   and supplied her quota of men so that no draft was ever imposed
                                   on her--a county within a fraction of 5,000 voters--and yet,
                                   under this apportionment she will not have a Representative on
                                   this floor, but must be tacked on to another county to be so
                                   entitled, I claim for my county as much intelligence as any other
                                   county in the State in proportion to her population, as
                                   exemplified in her colleges and schools, and on that score none
                                   can better deserve a fair apportionment. I know that the majority
                                   can do as they please; but it is my part to ask here for my
                                   people a fair representation--I care not what other county she
                                   may be associated with. I want to call attention to a few facts,
                                   upon which gentlemen may decide for themselves whether this bill
                                   proposes a fair apportionment. There is the county of Rush with
                                   3,500 voters, and she has one Representative. The county of
                                   Monroe, with 3,200, has one Representative; and yet my county,
                                   with 5,000, must be tacked on to Brown county for a joint
                                   Representative. There is Jennings county with 3,400; she should
                                   have been satisfied with one, but she must have a floating
                                   Representative, with nearly 2,000 less than my county; and my
                                   county must go with half a Representative on this floor. Ripley
                                   county, with about 4,300, Decatur with 4,200 must have each a
                                   Representative, more than their quota, but still they must have
                                   another representative tacked on as a float, though each of these
                                   have a voting population less than my county. And Parke
                                   county--what has she done more than others? She comes behind her
                                   quota, yet she hag a representative and a float! And the little
                                   county of Vermillion, (talk about a fair apportionment!) with a
                                   voting population of 2,245, not one-half the voting population of
                                   my county, and she must have one representative! I ask any one in
                                   all candor and honesty, is there any fairness about such an
                                   apportionment? Warren county, with 2,490, about half thequota,
                                   must be entitled to a full representative! Then the county of
                                   Lake, with 2,400; (about half the quota again,) she must appear
                                   on this floor with a full representative, while my county, with
                                   double the number of votes, must not have one! Perry, with 2,900,
                                   one; Lagrange, with 2.800, one; and Steuben, with 2,793, one.
                                   These little counties must be entitled to a full representative,
                                   while my county, with 5,000 must be contented with a float with
                                   Brown. All this in order that we may pass an equal apportionment
                                   bill. Mr. Speaker, I might stand here for an hour noting the
                                   unfairness of the bill, but I told you I was not going to say
                                   much. I might go over the different counties and show more of
                                   these inequalities, but I forbear
                              But now for the Senator. My county is tacked on to Brown county.
                                   Some gentleman will say to me: "Well, you have an
                                   overplus in the other end of the capitol." It is time
                                   that Brown and Bartholomew lack a little--a very little--of the
                                   quota for a Senator, but there are nine or ten other
                                   districts--Republican districts--that have a less voting
                                   population than Bartholomew and Brown. There is not a gen- tleman on this floor but
                                   sees that injustice has been done to my county, and this House
                                   can apply the remedy. I do not ask gentlemen to let me remedy it;
                                   I ask them to do it. And if this is not done, there will be one
                                   county, the fifth in the scale of wealth amongst all the counties
                                   of the State, that will not have the right to send one of her
                                   sons as a representative on this floor. I move that the bill be
                                   recommitted, and these inequalities remedied in some way or
                                   other.
                              The SPEAKER. The motion is not in order. There must be special
                                   instructions.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley. Gentlemen put their arguments very
                                   ingeniously, but very unfairly. In the very nature of things it
                                   is impossible to redistrict the State with exact equality. But I
                                   think the inequalities in this bill are distributed more equally
                                   than they would have been had the opposition prepared it
                                   themselves. The gentleman from Bartholomew (Mr. Barrett) has made
                                   a point of objection. His county is disfranchised. Let me say to
                                   that gentleman, that the counties of Bartholomew and Brown do not
                                   constitute a sufficient voting population to entitle them to a
                                   Senator, yet under this bill they are given a Senator; and that
                                   makes up for the deficiency of the award to Bartholomew for
                                   representative. It is claimed by gentlemen that Ripley county has
                                   more done for her than she is entitled to; but she has associated
                                   with her the counties of Switzerland and Ohio for a Senator ; and
                                   we have in those counties together a voting population of 10,000,
                                   and this is a Republican district. Seeing this large excess, I
                                   claimed this inequality disfranchised us. But I saw that somebody
                                   had to suffer, and that we were to be one of the victims, because
                                   it is impossible to fix an exactly equal representation--the
                                   Constitution prohibiting the dividing of counties. So we receive
                                   the fraction more than one. The Senator requires a voting
                                   population of 7,540, and the representative 3,770. The county of
                                   Pike has a representative with only 3,050; Perry, with
                                   3,442--one; Fountain with 3,421--one; Whitley, with 3,203; all
                                   these have each one representative without sufficient voting
                                   population. Now I call the attention of these gentlemen to their
                                   own work two years ago. Then the counties of Knox, Parke,
                                   Vermillion, and Warren, with a voting population of 8,920, were
                                   put together for a Senator, and 1,500 Republicans were proposed
                                   to be disfranchised. And I will give another instance where it
                                   was proposed by them to disfranchise 1,500 more of the people of
                                   the State. The same bill took the counties of Pike and Dubois,
                                   with 7,537 voters, lacking 2,000 of being entitled, and gave them
                                   a Senator. This is some of the work on the other side. I say that
                                   this pending bill is as fair as it can be, if we admit the rule
                                   of giving to the party in power the benefit of the doubt. We have
                                   worked over this bill in our committees, where men of the
                                   majority have been actuated by the most disinterested motives, to
                                   give a fair representation; and I believe we have done it. But
                                   this cry of inequality is always the cry of the minority ; and
                                   all those that have no party to-day, will come here combined
                                   against us two years hence. It is exceedingly strange that
                                   conscience has drawn such a line between men for the opposition
                                   of those actuated by no partizan considerations! and we know very
                                   well the object of these attempted delays. The Indianapolis Sentinel, of this morning, sounds the
                                   key-note; and it has been sounding it all through this
                                   discussion. I don't care what kind of a bill we may give
                                   to the opposition, if we postpone the consideration of this
                                   matter till the regular session, ever seat of the opposition will
                                   be vacated. This is but a song to lull us to sleep. They would
                                   leave this hall in one hour, if we attempted to pass this bill.
                                   Now it is for this reason that it seems to me that they are not
                                   actuated by the sincerity they profess, and which ought to belong
                                   to statesmen. Where has been the amendment offered to this bill
                                   by the minority? Every single amendment favorable to the minority
                                   has come from the majority, and it has come without their asking
                                   for it. Now, I say, this is not the part of sincerity. It is not
                                   treating the majority as they should be treated. We have
                                   magnanimously given them amendments which they not evinced the
                                   candor to ask at our hands.
                              Mr. JOHNSON. I had not intended to make a speech on this bill, and
                                   I shall not now attempt to discuss the alleged inequalities in
                                   the distribution of Senators and Representatives. It presents
                                   some inequalities, but no injustice. If there are inequalities,
                                   they are such as cannot be remedied. If gentlemen ask for more
                                   representation, the first thing to be considered is, what
                                   representation must be allowed under the Constitution?
                                   Bartholomew wants more representation, but where is it to come
                                   from? We are allowed but one hundred Representatives in this
                                   hall, and we can't assign a Representative to
                                   Bartholomew, because there is none for her; and gentlemen must
                                   remember that we can't take one from another county
                                   without marring the sys- tem
                                   and producing greater inequalities. But while Bartholomew has a
                                   little surplusage as to a Representative, she has more
                                   representation in the other end of the building than she is
                                   entitled to. So, that is equalized. I think the arguments which
                                   have been presented against the injustice of this bill have made
                                   it about as clear as mud. I do not think that anything has been
                                   shown to prove that this is an unjust bill. Whilst Democrats
                                   suffer in some localities, Republicans suffer in other
                                   localities. Then I would respectfully suggest to gentlemen who
                                   represent the Democratic party as standing with folded banners
                                   and grounded arms: Why not lay down your arms and surrender?
                              Mr. WALKER (in his seat). I'll not surrender.
                              Mr. JOHNSON. The gentleman from Johnson is something like General
                                   Buckner at Fort Donelson, when General Grant had him in his grip.
                                   He sent out a flag to General Grant, with a request that he might
                                   have a little time to prepare for him; but General Grant said:
                                   Unconditional surrender is the only thing. And I think it is
                                   justice now to give gentlemen here, just as good a chance as
                                   Grant gave to Buckner. We will accept their sword--their
                                   unconditional surrender. Mr. Speaker, if I thought this was an
                                   unfair or a dishonest bill, I would go amongst its friends and
                                   tell them, this bill is not right, and I think the Republican
                                   party can't afford to pass it. But I do not think so. I
                                   am satisfied that it is the very best apportionment that can be
                                   made or afforded by the State of Indiana. And now, as it is just
                                   twelve o'clock, I will move the previous question.
                              The House refused to second the demand.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. I regret very much, sir, that the discussion of this
                                   matter has been restricted to such a small compass of time that
                                   no gentleman can properly prepare himself to make a speech on it
                                   for the purpose of examining the merits of the case. I have
                                   decided, therefore, not to undertake a discussion which would
                                   require two or three days to do the subject or myself justice.
                                   But I have tried to satisfy gentlemen that I am not without
                                   proper self-respect by making an appeal to them. But now, whilst
                                   I know the bill will pass, I desire to add a few words more, as
                                   much as the limited lime will admit. The gentleman from Ripley,
                                   (Mr. Wilson.) and two gentlemen from Marion (Messrs. Johnson and
                                   Kimball,) all say this is a fair bill. As the gentleman from
                                   Marion (Mr. Kimball) said this morning that I touched his heart,
                                   so I say the gentleman from Ripley touched my heart when he spoke
                                   of the magnanimity with which the Democrats were treated in
                                   Republican caucuses. Mr. Speaker, I have gone into this bill with
                                   some diligence, for the purpose of seeing whether it has merits,
                                   and the further I went the worse it grew, and more outrageous,
                                   until it stands before my mind an unmitigated outrage and
                                   imposition upon the people. The gentleman from Marion (Mr.
                                   Kimball) says the Republican party always does right, and that
                                   when the Republican party disfranchises the Democratic party, it
                                   is all right because they do it. This is that
                                   gentleman's position. But there is one thing about this
                                   bill of which I desire to ask the gentleman from Ripley. Why is
                                   it in that this State, where Hendricks has just licked his
                                   Republican competitor,--why is it that so soon after, this bill
                                   is apportioned to give the Republican party on this floor 28
                                   majority? I ask the gentleman to rise and meet this question. Why
                                   have you this 28 majority? Where do you find it? For the counties
                                   of Floyd and Clark, with a vote of 10,728, there is given a
                                   Senator, while Jefferson county, with 5,405 votes, has a Senator;
                                   and these counties are adjoining each other. Clark county alone
                                   has a larger vote than Jefferson--6,040--yet she is put with
                                   Floyd for a Senator. But when Jefferson was set down for a
                                   Senator, I suppose that satisfied the gentleman from Jefferson,
                                   (Mr. Branham). Randolph has 5,014 votes, and Boone and Clinton,
                                   10,117, more than double the vote of Randolph, but each district
                                   has a Senator!
                              When this bill game into the House from the Senate, there was a
                                   hurrying to and fro, and the gentlemen Marion found that it would
                                   be necessary to refer it to the caucus; and when they did sowhen
                                   the bill had received that laborious and magnanimous
                                   consideration--the amendments they reported, enured if anything
                                   to the benefit of the majority. The gentleman from Marion, (Mr.
                                   Johnson) said that he did not like it, and desired a change,
                                   whereupon it went into caucus and came out amended, striking out
                                   a Senator for Shelby and Marion, and inserting in lieu a Senator
                                   for the counties of Morgan and Marion. If it had been left Shelby
                                   and Marion there might have been an opposition Senator for that
                                   district, but putting on Morgan makes a Republican Senator
                                   certain. I find these changes made in the bill do not better the
                                   minority. There were several things in that caucus which availed
                                   to change the bill which I do not understand, of course, but I
                                   understand that the
                                   gentleman from Decatur (Mr. Miller) was up in arms against it,
                                   and when it came in from the caucus Decatur has another Senator
                                   with Scott and Jennings. That satisfied the gentleman from
                                   Decatur. Every amendment was made for the satisfaction of
                                   gentlemen who were opposed to it on the side of their own
                                   political intersts. I have a large mess of stuff figured here,
                                   and I find that, in every instance where it was possible to
                                   absorb Democratic Representatives and Democratic Senators, it has
                                   been done. Therefore, I am constrained to say that, upon proper
                                   consideration, the House would not pass such a bill.
                              Mr. WESNER demanded the previous question, and there was a second,
                                   and under the pressure the final vote on the bill was ordered and
                                   taken, resulting--yeas, 52; nays 42--as follows:

                              Mr. KIMBALL moved to reconsider the vote just taken, and to lay the
                                   motion to reconsider on the table.
                              The latter motion was agreed to.
                              Mr, CAUTHORN moved ineffectually to amend the title of the bill by
                                   adding these words: "and apportioning the same in such a
                                   manner as to perpetuate the power of the Republican party, and

                              The House was called to order at two o'clock.

                                   of the committee bill [H. R. 261] to amend the common school law

                                   the legality of the specific appropriation bill several years
                                   ago. Mr. Smith demanded the yeas and nays on the question of
                                   concurrence.
                              After debate, in support of the report by Messrs. Cobb, Cowgill,

                                   & Hendricks for $750 for legal services, whereupon

                              The report was concurred in--yeas 45, nays 33.
                              Mr. DIAL reported for allowance of the claim of Newcomb, Mitchell
                                   & Ketchum for $200 for legal services; of the Republican

                                   for allowance of the claim of John H. Farquhar for $2,000 on

                                   State.
                              Mr. LENFESTY submitted a minority report adverse to the allowance.
                                   The minority report was substituted for the report of the
                                   majority--yeas 43, nays 41.
                              On motion of Mr, CAUTHORN, this vote was reconsidered, and the
                                   question recurred on substituting the minority report.
                              
                              On motion of Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, the minority report was laid on
                                   the table, and then the allowance was concurred in.
                              Mr. DIAL also returned the claims of Isaiah McDonald and others,
                                   members of the Committee on State Prisons, at

                                   Morgan raid, recommending that it be laid on the table; which was
                                   concureed in.
                              He also reported for the allowance of the claim of John G. Hanning

                              Mr. LENFESTY submitted a minority report recommending that the
                                   claim be not allowed.
                              On motion of Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, the report of the minority was
                                   laid on the table, and then the majority report was concurred in.
                                   Yeas, 51; nays, 25.
                              Mr. WALKER moved to reconsider this vote.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN moved to lay the motion to reconsider on the table,
                                   which was agreed to--Yeas, 40; nays, 36.
                              Mr, KIMBALL submitted a proposition to amend the specific bill [H.
                                   R 259] by striking out the allowance of $150 each to the

                                   the request of Mr. Clerk Nixon.]
                              It was adopted.
                              Mr. MILLER submitted a motion to reconsider the vote by which the
                                   claim of Theodore W. Coy, Clerk of the Supreme Court, for extra
                                   services, to the extent of $1,689 was rejected.
                              The motion to reconsider was adopted, and the question recurred on
                                   the adoption of the report of the majority of the committee.
                              After debate by Messrs. Branham, Shirley, Thompson, of Elkhart,
                                   Baker, Thayer, Cobb and Kimball, the recommendation for allowance
                                   of $1,689 was again rejected--yeas, 36: nays, 40.
                              The specific bill [H. R. 259], as amended, was now read the second
                                   time.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN submitted a resolution (which was adopted) for an
                                   order that Cyrus T. Nixon, Principal Clerk of the House of
                                   Representatives, and Moses T. McLain, First Assistant Clerk, be
                                   each allowed the sum of $200 for indexing and correcting the
                                   proof-sheets of the Journal of the House, and for preparing an
                                   abstract of the House Journal, including the filling of all bills
                                   remaining for action at the special session.
                              It was adopted by unanimous consent.
                         
                         
                              COMMON SCHOOLS.
                              The SPEAKER announced the consideration of the special order for
                                   this day at half-past two o'clock p. m., viz: the
                                   Education Committee's bill [H. R. 261] to amend section
                                   1 of the Common School law of March 6, 1865; which was by
                                   previous order referred to the Committee of the Whole House.
                              The House then resolved into Committee of the Whole (Mr. Cauthorn
                                   in the chair) and the CHAIRMAN according to order announced the
                                   consideration of Mr. Mellett's Education Committee bill
                                   [H. R. 261] proposing to raise the school tax from 16 to 20 cents
                                   on the $100 of taxables, and to provide that it shall be expended
                                   for tuition purposes alone.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY who had drafted the bill for the Committee, stated its
                                   object. The first section of the school law, since 1865, collects
                                   16 cents on the $100 "for common school
                                   purposes;" and this bill proposes simply to raise this
                                   from 16 to 20 cents, and provides that the whole amount thus
                                   raised "shall be expended for tuition purposes in
                                   schools." It is thought, that with this increase,
                                   together with what is expected from the new assessment bill, we
                                   shall have enough to open the common schools for six months in
                                   the year to all the children of the State.
                              Mr. BRANHAM was opposed to the bill--opposed to levying taxes in
                                   the dark. He would have the Superintendent of Public Instruction
                                   to come in and tell us just how much money he wanted, and ask the
                                   House to make the levy accordingly. And on his motion, seconded
                                   by Mr. BUTTERWORTH, the committee rose and the CHAIRMAN reported
                                   the bill to the House without recommendation, and asked and
                                   obtained discharge from its further consideration.
                              The Committee of the Whole were discharged accordingly.
                              And the House then adjourned.
                         
                         
                    
                    
                    
                         THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                         
                         THIRTEENTH VOLUME.
                         
                         INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
                         
                         IN SENATE.
                         
                              FRIDAY, December 20, 1872.
                         
                         The Senate met at ten o'clock.
                         The proceedings were opened with a prayer by the Rev. Mr. Tinsey, pastor
                              of Asbury Methodist Episcopal Church.
                         Mr. DWIGGINS moved that the reading of the journal be dispensed
                              with.
                         Mr. WILLIAMS objected. He wanted at least that portion read which
                              contained the record of his appeal from the decision of the Chair
                              yesterday.
                         On motion of Mr. SCOTT, the reading of the journal was dispensed with,
                              except so much as related to Mr. Williams' appeal.
                         Mr. WILLIAMS objected to the journal because it did not show that the
                              Senate concurred in the House amendments of the redistricting bill
                              before his appeal was put.
                         
                              THE HUNTING BILL.
                              On motion of Mr. NEFF, the bill [H. R. 8] to prevent hunting and
                                   shooting on enclosed lands without the consent of the owner
                                   thereof, was taken up.
                              Mr. ROSENBRUGH moved to amend by inserting after the words
                                   "occupant thereof," the words:
                                   "provided that such owner or occupant thereof shall have
                                   given due notice to the public, warning all persons not to hunt
                                   upon said enclosure by posting notices, not less than three, in
                                   three public places upon said premises."
                              Mr. NEFF opposed the amendment. He said if the bill became a law it
                                   was of itself notice to all the world. More than that, as the
                                   bill referred only to enclosed lands, the presence of the fence,
                                   when hunters came to it, was a notice.
                              Mr HARNEY opposed the bill. He was in favor of punishing the man
                                   who enters premises and commits wrong, but the simple entry upon
                                   premises ought not to render a man liable to prosecution.
                              Mr. SCOTT was willing that the amendment should be adopted, for the
                                   people in his vicinity have already posted such notices, and they
                                   understand that to be the law now. No man has a right to take
                                   wild game where he injures another man by doing so.
                              Mr. STEELE would prefer to see this bill passed over till the next
                                   session. He thought it would be wrong to pass it before having a
                                   full and fair discussion.
                              Mr. HARNEY moved to postpone the further consideration of this
                                   subject till next session.
                              The motion was rejected--yeas 21, nays 22.
                              Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence (Mr. HUBBARD in the chair) moved to lay
                                   the subject on the table. It was agreed to--yeas 25, nays 18.
                         
                         
                              FRANKLIN INSURANCE COMPANY.
                              Mr. BROWN moved to dispense with the constitutional rule, in order
                                   that the bill [H. R. 36] to amend the charter of the Franklin
                                   Life Insurance Company may be read the first and second times by
                                   title, the third time by sections, and pushed to the final vote.
                                   [It proposes to increase the amount of a share of stock of the
                                   Franklin Insurance Company
                                   from $25 to $50, and to change the name of the company, from the
                                   Franklin to the Indianapolis Insurance Company.]
                              The motion was rejected by yeas 25, nays 18.
                         
                         
                              FEMALE REFORMATORY.
                              On motion by Mr. BEESON, the bill [H. R. 211] making an
                                   appropriation of $50,000 to finish and furnish the female prison,
                                   and put in order the grounds thereof, was read the second
                                   time.
                         
                         
                              RAILROAD CONTRACTS.
                              On motion by Mr, RHODES, the bill [H. R. 241] to give security to
                                   persons who contract to perform work or labor for railroad
                                   corporations, was read the first time.
                         
                         
                              COUNTY PROPERTY.
                              On motion of Mr. SCOTT, the Senate refused to concur in the House
                                   amendments to his bill [S. 166] regulating the sale of county
                                   property and the letting and building of public buildings, and
                                   asked for a committee of free conference thereon.
                              The House amendment struck out the section requiring County
                                   Commissioners to file plans and specifications of
                                   bridges,buildings, fences, etc., before advertising for contracts
                                   to do the work.
                              Mr. RHODES moved for a constitutional dispensation, that the bill
                                   [H. R. 241] may be advanced to the final vote thereon.
                              The motion was rejected--yeas 18, nays 21.
                         
                         
                              SPECIFIC APPROPRIATIONS.
                              On motion by Mr. BROWN, the bill [H. R. 259] making specific
                                   appropriations for the year 1871 and 1872,, was read the first
                                   time, and under a dispensation of the constitutional restriction,
                                   it was read the second time by title only, and referred to the
                                        Committee on Finance.
                         
                         
                              CLAIMS.
                              Mr. ORR, from the Committee on Claims, returned
                                   the accounts of the Guttenberg Printing Company of $476 60 for
                                   papers furnished the Senate last session, with a recommendation
                                   that it be referred to the Finance Committee for incorporotion in
                                   the specific appropriation bill.
                              The report was concurred in.
                         
                         
                              NUMBER OF EMPLOYES.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS offered a resolution directing the Principal
                                   Secretary, Assistant Secretary, Doorkeeper, President of the
                                   Senate, and the chairman of each standing committee, to furnish
                                   the name of each employe, the number employed by each, and the
                                   duties performed by each.
                              Mr. SCOTT moved that the resolution lie on the table. He said the
                                   number of employes had been fixed by the Senate and their names
                                   had once been reported.
                              The motion was rejected by yeas 18, nays 26.
                              Then came the recess for dinner.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The Senate met pursuant to adjournment.
                              Mr. Williams' resolution pending at the noon recess, was
                                   taken up.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved to amend the resolution so as to require the
                                   report called for to be made at the commencment of the next
                                   session.
                              Mr. BROWN said he was opposed to an attempt to build up a political
                                   party upon such cheap capital as this, and moved to lay the whole
                                   subject on the table.
                              The motion was agreed to by yeas 20, nays 19.
                         
                         
                              ADJOURNMENT SINE DIE.
                              Mr. GLESSNER asked and failed to obtain consent to offer a
                                   resolution that the present session of the General Assembly, on
                                   Saturday, at twelve o'clock m., do adjourn sine die.
                              Mr. BROWN moved to amend by fixing the time of adjournment at noon
                                   next Sunday.
                              The resolution was laid on the table.
                         
                         
                              VENTILLATION.
                              Mr. THOMPSON, by consent, offered a resolution that Messrs. Smith,
                                   Scott and Oliver make such suggestions as will secure the proper
                                   heating and ventilation of the Senate Chamber, and take measures
                                   to put it in proper condition for the meeting of the Senate at
                                   the next session.
                              Mr. CARNAHAN moved as amendment that the State Librarian be
                                   instructed to cause the flues that warm the chamber to be
                                   cleansed and repaired by the next regular meeting of the
                                   Assembly. He said an investigation of the flues in the House
                                   showed that there was more than a bushel of tobacco quids and
                                   stumps of cigars through which the air had to find its way, and
                                   hence the poisonous effluvia.
                              On motion of Mr. ORR, Mr. Carnahan's amendment was laid on
                                   the table.
                              The resolution was adopted.
                         
                         
                              COUNTY SEATS.
                              Mr. BROWN, from the Judiciary Committee,
                                   returned to the files the bill [S. 148] on the relocation of county seats,
                                   that it may take its place on the calender of bills for
                                   consideration at the regular session.
                         
                         
                              EMPLOYES.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS, from the joint committee of free conference on the
                                   bill [S.145] relating to the number of employes, recommended that
                                   the House recede from all its amendments except the amendment
                                   allowing the clerks of the House each an extra assistant, and a
                                   page, and that the Senate concur in that.
                              Concurred in.
                         
                         
                              JUDGES' SALARIES.
                              The PRESIDENT announced the special orderthe Judges'
                                   salary bill [S. 9], which on motion of Mr. Brown was placed on
                                   the files.
                         
                         
                              TERRE HAUTE AND INDIANAPOLIS RAILROAD.
                              Mr. BROWN, by leave, offered a resolution, as follows:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, That the
                                                  Committee on Railroads be
                                                  authorized to continue its investigations in
                                                  reference to the Indianapolis and Terre Haute
                                                  Railroad after the adjournment of the present
                                                  session, and report its investigations to the next
                                                  session of the General Assembly; and the members
                                                  of said committee shall have for their services
                                                  during the time they are engaged, the same
                                                  compensation allowed members of the General
                                                  Assembly.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Mr. SCOTT saw no need of continuing so large a committee, if one
                                   must be appointed. He believed the investigation to be useless,
                                   and moved to reduce the number to three.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS said the matter was a very important one, involving,
                                   as it was claimed, a million of dollars for the school fund, and
                                   he thought the responsibility too heavy to be placed on the
                                   shoulders of three men.
                              Mr. BROWN referred to the twenty-third section of the charter of
                                   that railroad, and declared there was not such a provision in the
                                   charter of any railroad in the United States. The committee have
                                   taken the initiatory steps for bringing before the Legislature a
                                   proper account of this matter. With the information already
                                   obtained by the attorneys for the State in the suit now pending
                                   against the railroad, together with such as the committee may be
                                   able to obtain from other sources, he thought an statement might
                                   be made which would probably be of great importance to the
                                   State.
                              Mr. DWiGGINS suggested that there was still another question of
                                   even graver importance into which the committee might inquire,
                                   and that is whether the company has not forfeited its charter by
                                   its neglect to pay over the surplus to the school fund as
                                   required by law.
                              Mr. GOODING said a suit was now pending to declare the franchises
                                   of the company forfeited, and he thought the information which
                                   this committee might obtain would be of great value not only to
                                   the Attorney General's prosecution of that suit, but in
                                   a suit to recover the money due to the school fund. This
                                   committee has a great deal of work to do if it does its duty, and
                                   it ought to consist of five members, and they ought to take the
                                   time and sound this thing thoroughly, so as to put it to rest in
                                   the public mind.
                              Mr. GREGG. Considering the amount involved in the proposed
                                   investigation ($1,000,000) the expense of having the whole
                                   committee would be a trifling consideration. He moved to lay the
                                   amendment on the table.
                              The motion was agreed to, and the resolution was then adopted.
                         
                         
                              DECEDENTS ESTATES.
                              On motion of Mr. CARNAHAN, the bill [S. 71] to amend sections 7 and
                                   49 of the act for the settlement of decedents estates, approved
                                   June 16, 1852, was read the second time.
                              Mr. CARNAHAN explained that in section 7 it changed the length of
                                   time--five instead of fifteen days--and in section 49, twelve
                                   days' instead of three weeks' notice of sale.
                                   He moved for a suspension of the constitutional rule that the
                                   bill may be passed to the final vote in the Senate
                              The motion was agreed to--yeas, 39; nays, 0, and the bill was read
                                   the third time and passed--yeas, 40; nays, 0.
                         
                         
                              COMMITTEE ROOMS.
                              Mr. HUBBARD, by leave, offered a resolution requesting the State
                                   Librarian to take charge of the property in the room of the
                                        Committee on Corporations.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS offered a substitute, directing the Librarian to take
                                   charge of and keep the property belonging to the State in all the
                                   committee rooms, except the rooms of the Judiciory
                                        Committee.
                              Mr. HUBBARD accepted the amendment as a substitute for his
                                   resolution.
                              Mr. DAGGY moved to amend by restricting the resolution to the rooms
                                   occupied by the Committees on Finance and Organization
                                        of Courts.
                              Mr. BROWN moved to amend further by adding the words:
                                        "The Committee on
                                   Corporations."
                              
                              Mr. DAGGY accepted.
                              The amendment was agreed to, and so the resolution was adopted.
                         
                         
                              COUNTY PROPERTY.
                              Mr. SCOTT, from the joint Committee of Free Conference on his bill,
                                   [S. 166] report- an amendment providing that the bill shall not
                                   apply to pending cases of relocation ot county seats and
                                   recommending that House recede from its amendments.
                              Mr. BEESON opposed the amendment. He said that the act providing
                                   for the relocation of the county seat of Wayne county was covered
                                   all over with fraud. There is a ring at work in Richmond, and
                                   unless some measures are taken to restrain it, Wayne county would
                                   be involved in an expense of from three to four hundred thousand
                                   dollars in the construction of a new court house at Richmond. The
                                   commissioner have never employed an architect, as the law
                                   requires, nor has a plan or specification or estimates of the
                                   cost ever been filed. He wanted the bill so framed as to afford
                                   the necessary relief for Wayne county as well as Vigo county.
                              Mr. DAGGY said this proviso was gotten up by himself so that the
                                   county seat question should be entirely ignored--so as to avoid
                                   legislation either for or against a county seat--so this act
                                   shall be construed neither for nor against the county seat
                                   question. It leaves the county seat law question intact in every
                                   particular, and it leaves the question of remedies they have
                                   outside of this act. Therefore this provision expressly states
                                   that it shall not apply to anything of that kind. This is done to
                                   meet a demand from other quarters.
                              Mr. STEELE understood the difficulty to be this: The Senator from
                                   Vigo wishes to prevent a Court House being built at the expense
                                   of a county, without proper advertising, and the very same
                                   difficulty occurs with the people of Wayne county. He did not
                                   want the bill limited by the amendment so that it would apply to
                                   Vigo county alone. He wanted it framed so that its provision
                                   would apply to every county in the State. He thought it wrong
                                   either in the county of Vigo or the county of Wayne to compel the
                                   people to contribute to the building of a costly Court House when
                                   the proper steps have not been taken.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS raised the point of order that a committee of free
                                   conference have no right to introduce new matter in their
                                   report.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS. Let the county seat law remain as it is, and
                                   don't smother it by attempting to tack on something for
                                   the benefit of some particular locality. He favored the proposed
                                   amendment, as it leaves the county seat question where it is.
                              Mr. STEELE proposed to stand by the bill of the Senator from Vigo
                                   (Mr. Scott) without the crossing of a "t" or the dotting of an "i," and again insisted that such a
                                   law should be general in its application.
                              Mr. BROWN made the point of order that the report was not in order,
                                   as a committee of conference could introduce no new matter.
                              The PRESIDENT pro tem (Mr. Gooding, in the chair) held the point
                                   well taken.
                         
                         
                              THE SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION BILL.
                              Mr. STEELE, from the Committee on Finance,
                                   returned the specific appropriation bill [H. R. 259] with sundry
                                   amendments thereto.
                              On motion of Mr. DAGGY, the amendments were considered by
                                   sections.
                              The section allowing $880 to C. W. Stagg for taking and
                                   transcribing short hand notes in the Burson case last session
                                   being read--after considerable discussion--
                              The committee amendment was concurred in.
                              Mr. DAGGY moved that the constitutional restriction be dispensed
                                   with and the bill be read the second time by sections.
                              The motion was agreed to--yeas 38, nays1.
                              Accordingly the bill was read by sections.
                              And then the Senate took a recess till eight o'clock p.
                                   m.
                         
                              
                         
                              NIGHT SESSION.
                              The Senate met at eight o'clock.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN moved to amend the pending bill by striking
                                   out the section allowing the Attorney General $4,000 for extra
                                   services on behalf of the State, during the years 1870 and
                                   1871.
                              Mr. ROSEBRUGH spoke earnestly against the motion.
                              Mr. DAGGY moved to amend Mr. O'Brien's motion, so
                                   as to allow Mr. Hanna $2,000 in full for extra services to the
                                   end of 1872.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN said that he did not make his motion with any
                                   political feeling. He was willing to vote to pay any officer for
                                   extra services rendered, but he could not learn that Mr. Hanna
                                   had rendered the State any extra service. He had been credibly
                                   informed that when the suits were pending in which these services
                                   are said to have been rendered, the State was represented by
                                   other attorneys, and the papers were asking where Mr. Hanna was?
                                   why the State was not represented by her proper officer? Believing,
                                   therefore, that Mr. Hanna was entitled to no extra pay because he
                                   had rendered no extra service, he was opposed to Mr.
                                   Daggy's motion.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS demanded the previous question.
                              The demand was seconded by the Senate.
                              Mr. Daggy's motion was rejected--yeas, 17; nays, 29.
                              The vote on Mr. O'Brien's motion stood--yeas, 16;
                                   nays, 29.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved to amend the section by striking out $4,000 and
                                   inserting $2,001.
                              Mr. SLEETH moved, as a substitute, to strike out $4,000 and insert
                                   $1,600. He said there was no provision in the statute for
                                   furnishing the office, and yet he found by reference to the
                                   report of the Treasurer of State, that Mr Hanna had drawn $405 on
                                   that account. This, added to the $1,600, proposed by his
                                   amendment, would make $2,000, and this he was willing to
                                   allow.
                              Mr. BROWN suggested that the friends and opponents of the section
                                   compromise by striking out $4,000 and inserting $2,500.
                              Mr. WILLIAMS moved to lay Mr. Sleeth's substitute on the
                                   table.
                              The motion was agreed to by yeas, 31; nays, 13.
                              Mr. BROWN offered a substitute allowing $2,500 in full for all
                                   extra services rendered by him in behalf of the State during his
                                   entire term of office.
                              It was adopted.
                              The section, as amended, was agreed to--yeas 36, nays 9.
                         
                         
                              EXTRA PAY OF COMMON PLEAS JUDGES.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN moved to amend by striking out the section
                                   allowing $10 a day to Judges for holding extra terms of courts,
                                   because it is ambiguous and provides for the payment of Common
                                   Pleas Judges out of the State Treasury, when their pay comes from
                                   County Treasuries.
                              Mr. SMITH demanded the previous question.
                              The Senate seconded the demand for the previous question, and under
                                   its operation the amendment was agreed to.
                              Mr. DWIGGINS moved to strike out the section allowing $65 50 to the
                                   Jeffersonville railroad for transportation of persons on military
                                   passes in 1866.
                              It was rejected.
                              Mr. GREGG moved to amend section 15 by allowing E. P. Beauchamp $30
                                   instead of $81.
                              The amendment was agreed to.
                              Mr. SLEETH moved to strike out the allowance of $2,800 to Barbour
                                   and Jacobs for legal services under authority of the Governor and
                                   State officers. He understood that Marion county would have
                                   obtained three-fourths of the advantage had the suit been
                                   successful, but as far as he could ascertain from dilligent
                                   inquiry this firm should receive not more than $800. The previous
                                   question was demanded and seconded and under its operation--
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. NEFF moved to strike out the section allowing Holland and
                                   Binkley $2,359 for legal services.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              Mr. CHAPMAN moved to strike out the section allowing $785 for the
                                   Sunday Post furnished during the session of 1871.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                              On motion of Mr. GOODING, the amendments of the Senaate were
                                   considered as engrossed, the constitutional restriction dispensed
                                   with--yeas, 41; nays, 0--the bill read the third time and
                                   passed--yeas, 42; nays, 0.
                         
                         
                              REFORMATORY.
                              On motion of Mr. DAGGY, the nomination by the Governor of the Board
                                   of Managers of the Indiana Reformatory Institution, viz.: Joseph
                                   I. Irwin, for four years from the first day of May, 1869;
                                   Stoughton A. Fletcher, four years, from the first day of May,
                                   1871; F. S. Armstrong, for four years, from the first day of May,
                                   1872, were confirmed by the Senate.
                         
                         
                              COUTNY PROPERTY.
                              On motion by Mr. SCOTT, the Senate receded from its disagreements
                                   to the amendments of the House to the bill [166], and concurred
                                   in the House amendments.
                         
                         
                              SOLDIERS' BOUNTY.
                              On motion by Mr. GREGG, the joint resolution [H. R. 3] instructing
                                   Indiana Congressmen to favor the passage of a law to equalize the
                                   bounty of soldiers and seamen of the late war was passed by yeas
                                   38; nays, 0.
                              Mr. NEFF offered a resolution, which was adopted, requesting the
                                   Librarian to place new locks on the outer door of the Senate
                                   Chamber.
                              Mr. DAGGY, from the Committee on Organization of
                                        Courts, reported back Senate resolution in
                                   relation to Criminal and Civil Courts and the memorial of the Bar
                                   Association, and recommended that they lie on the table until the
                                   next session.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              Mr. BEESON, from the Committee on Temperance,
                                   returned Senate bills No. 12. and 114, with a recommendation that
                                   they be placed on the calendar.
                              
                              The report was concurred in.

                                   and that the President draw his warrant for the same.
                              The report was concurred in.

                                   be placed on the calendar in regular order.
                         
                         
                              NEW STATE HOUSE.
                              Mr. SCOTT called up House concurrent resolution offering $1,000 as
                                   a premium for the best plans and specifications for a new State
                                   House, $600 for the second best and $400 for the third best, and
                                   authorizing the committee to visit the capitals of different

                              with the reading of the journal, but Mr. HARDESTY and Mr. RUMSEY
                              successively objecting--
                         The journal was read and approved.
                         
                              SPECIFIC APPROPRIATIONS.
                              Mr. KIMBALL, from the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means, reported the return to the House of their
                                   bill [H R. 259] making specific appropriations for the years 1871
                                   and 1S72, with sundry amendments thereto, incorporated under
                                   specific instructions of the House of Representatives; and so
                                   amended, the committee recommened its passage.
                              The report was concurred in.
                              The bill, as amended, was again read through by the Clerk.
                              Mr. MILLER. I desire to offer an amendment to the bill. The
                                   committee have just reported amendments, and I suppose amendments
                                   to be still in order.
                              The SPEAKER. The bill has not been ordered to be engrossed. If the
                                   House wish to consider the bill further it might be better to do
                                   so in Committee of the Whole, it will save
                                   journalizing.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN objected to any amendment of the bill at this stage.
                                   It has been read twice, and is now on the third reading.
                              On the motion of Mr. HARDESTY, the bill was referred to the
                                   Committee of the Whole House : Whereupon--
                              The House resolved into Committee of the Whole--Mr. Cauthorn in the
                                   chair.
                              The CHAIRMAN announced the consideration of the bill and directed
                                   the Clerk to read the first section.
                              Mr. BRANHAM suggested that it is useless for the House to consider
                                   this bill in Committee of the Whole; because these items have all
                                   been adopted by the House, and there can be no possible advantage
                                   in it. It is only lost time. If gentlemen would avoid getting
                                   their names on the journal, let me tell them that every step
                                   taken in Committee of the Whole will get on the journal when the
                                   bill comes back again to the House. I therefore move that the
                                   committee rise and report the bill to the House without
                                   recommendation.
                              The motion was agreed to, whereupon the committee rose, and the
                                   CHAIRMAN reported accordingly.
                              The report was concurred in.
                         
                         
                              B. W. HANNA.
                              Mr. MILLER submitted a motion to amend the bill by striking out the
                                   27th section--an allowance of $4,000 to B. W. Hanna for extra
                                   services as Attorney General.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. The only way to reach that is, to reconsider the vote
                                   by which it was adopted yesterday.
                              The SPEAKER. There was a motion to reconsider, and that motion was
                                   laid on the table.
                              
                              Mr. COBB. I hope this action will not be taken. We can't
                                   stoop to this matter. We can afford to be just. We can't
                                   afford to be mean.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN insisted that the bill is now on the third
                                   reading.
                              The SPEAKER, The is no endorsement of the order for engrossment. (A
                                   special reference to the Journal of yesterday showed that there
                                   was a motion to reconsider the Hanna allowance, and that it was
                                   laid on the table.) The amendment proposed by the gentleman from
                                   Decatur [Mr. Millar,] can't be entertained again at this
                                   stage of the bill.
                              On motion of Mr. KIMBALL, the bill was amended further by an
                                   allowance to Julius Boettischer, of $108 15 for newspapers.
                              The bill, was then considered as engrossed, and passed the third
                                   reading in the House of Representatives--yeas, 51; nays, 39--as

                              The SPEAKER announced the special order, viz: the consideration of

                              Mr. OGDEN demanded a call of the House, which proceeded till it was

                              So the bill passed the House of Representatives.
                              Mr. WALKER moved to reconsider the vote just taken and to lay the
                                   motion on the table.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN. There is but one motion. I am in favor of
                                   reconsidering this vote. I think the bill as amended is doing
                                   manifest and great in justice to the Democratic party, and I do
                                   hope that the House will reconsider, and let the bill go over to
                                   the regular session, when the House will have time to give us one
                                   that is fair. This is not fair.
                              On the motion of Mr. COBB, the motion to reconsider was laid on the
                                   table--yeas 52, nays 39.
                              On motion of Mr. LENFESTY, the Senate message calling for a

                                   House amendments to the bill [S.145] were taken up. [The House
                                   amendments increase the clerical force of the House and
                                   committees, and strike out the provisions which are contained in

                                   passed into an act.]
                              The SPEAKER. The question is: Will the House recede?
                              Mr. WALKER and Mr. MILLER moved for a Committee of Conference,
                                   which was ordered, and the Speaker thereupon appointed Messrs.
                                   Wilson of Ripley and Peed to act on the part of the House of
                                   Representatives.

                              Mr. MELLETT moved that the Librarian be instructed to carry out the

                                   and ventilating the hall.
                              The motion was agreed to.
                         
                         
                              SOLDIERS' BOUNTY.
                              The Senate Joint Resolution No 3, instructing Senators to support
                                   the bill pending in the United States Senate giving bounty land
                                   to honorably discharged soldiers and seamen, was taken up and
                                   finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas 77, nays 0.

                              Mr. KIRKPATRICK called up the consideration of the bill [S. 150] to
                                   legalize taxation heretofore levied by the School Trustees of incorporated towns or
                                   cities for the purpose of tuition in the common schools (shall
                                   have the same effect as if levied by the Common Council) was
                                   taken up. The House rejected his motion to suspend the
                                   restrictions, and the bill was ordered to the second reading
                                   to-morrow.
                         
                         
                              COUNTY PROPERTY.
                              The bill [S. 166] to regulate the sale of county property and the
                                   letting of public buildings, bridges, fences and monuments, was
                                   taken up on the first reading.
                              Mr. EDWARDS, of Vigo (Mr. Cauthorn in the chair), asked a
                                   suspension of the restrictions, that the bill might be carried to
                                   the final passage now.
                              The restrictions were suspended, and the bill (with clerical
                                   amendments) finally passed--yeas 82, nays 2.
                         
                         
                              MANUFACTURING AND MINING COMPANIES.
                              The bill [S. 151] to amend the first section of the act of March
                                   11,1861, to amend the act of May 20, 1852, for the incorporation
                                   of manufacturing and mining companies, and to provide for the
                                   incorporation of grain elevators and Union stock yards and
                                   transit companies, came up in order on the first reading.
                              On motion of Mr. BILLINGSLEY the restrictions were suspended and
                                   the bill was finally passed the House of Representatives--yeas
                                   75, nays 4.
                         
                         
                              COUNTY BOUNTIES.
                              On motion of Mr. MELLETT, the order of business was suspended, and
                                   Mr. Lenfesty, from the Committee on Federal
                                        Relations, returned Mr. Mellett's bill
                                   [H. R. 200] to authorize county commissioners to legalize county
                                   bounties, with an amendment that such county
                                   commissioners' action shall be restricted to cases where
                                   such authorized bonds have been destroyed. [It is meant to cover
                                   the case of Delaware county, in which the bonds, which had been
                                   ordered for the purpose of paying bounties, were destroyed, and
                                   having been restored, are now ready to be issued.]
                              The amendments were concurred in, the bill being on the second
                                   reading.
                              On motion of Mr. MELLETT, the restrictions were suspended, and the
                                   bill was put on its final passage.
                              The bill was read the second and third times, and pending further
                                   action a message was received from the Senate announcing
                                   non-concurrence in the House's amendment to the Senate
                                   bill 166, and asking a Committee of Conference.
                              On motion of Mr. EDWARDS, of Vigo (Mr. Cauthorn in the chair), the
                                   House took up the Senate disagreement to the House amendments to
                                   the bill [S. 166] and asking for a committee of conference, and
                                   on his further motion the House refused to recede from its
                                   amendment, and authorized a committee of conference, whereupon
                                   the Speaker appointed Messrs. Baxter and Walker to serve as said
                                   committee on the part of the House.
                              The House then took a recess till two o'clock p. m.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The SPEAKER pursued the consideration of Mr. Mellett's
                                   county bonds legalization bill [H. R. 200.]
                              Mr. TINGLEY desired that the bill be postponed till the regular
                                   session, presenting such considerations as gained the
                                   acquiescence of Mr. Mellett; and accordingly the bill retains its
                                   place on the calendar.
                         
                         
                              ORGANIZING THE ASSEMBLY.
                              Mr. PEED, from the the Committee of Conference on the disagreeing
                                   votes of the two Houses as to the House amendments to the bill
                                   [S. 145] in relation to the organization of the General Assembly,
                                   etc., recommending that the House recede from all its amendments
                                   to said bill, except those applied to section 2, which have been
                                   concurred in by the Senate.
                              The report was concurred in.
                         
                         
                              FELONIES.
                              The SPEAKER announced the consideration of the Senate amendments to
                                   Mr. Edwards of Vigo's bill [H. R. 148] defining certain
                                   felonies and prescribing punishment. etc.
                              Mr. EDWARDS, of Vigo (Mr. Peed in the chair.) This bill defines and
                                   provides for punishing it as a felony for any city officer having
                                   an interest in any contract for the construction of a public
                                   building. The Senate amendments are designed to make its
                                   provisions apply to town and State officers. I hope the
                                   amendments will be concurred in.
                              The Senate amendments were concurred in.
                         
                         
                              THOROUGHFARES AND WATER COURSES.
                              On motion of Mr. BILLINGSLEY, Mr. King's bill [H. R. 100]
                                   relative to the laying out, opening, widening, straightening and
                                   vacating of streets, alleys and highways, and for altering water
                                   courses in the cities of the State, and providing commissioners
                                   to assess damages, etc., and providing the duties of city
                                   officers therein was taken up, it being on the second
                                   reading.
                              
                              Mr. BILLINGSLEY moved for a suspension of the restrictions.
                              Mr. SMITH opposed the motion and the bill; and submitted amendments
                                   to the 4th and 9th sections restricting the assessments for
                                   benefits to the streets widened, etc., which were adopted after
                                   debate; and the bill was then laid on the table.
                         
                         
                              COAL MINING REGULATIONS.
                              Mr. SCHMUCK called up the committee bill [H. R. 230] regulating
                                   coal mines and the working thereof, it being on the third
                                   reading.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN, I move that the bill be referred again to the
                                        Committee on manufacture and commerce, to
                                   be reported to the next session. I understand that this bill is
                                   in the interests of the miners, or those engaged in that
                                   business, and I think it should be well considered.
                              Mr. SCHMUCK. It is for the protection of the lives of the workers
                                   in the mines, they have a similar law in Pennsylvania, Virginia,
                                   Ohio and Illinois, and in our State there ought to be some such
                                   protection for the coal miners. We have to day 500 men working in
                                   the coal mines whose lives are not thus protected, and who are
                                   calling for this bill. Therefore, I think it is very important
                                   that it should be passed at this session. We all know how far men
                                   engaged in business will go to hazard the lives of their
                                   employes; and this bill is not a new thing. The law works well
                                   and satisfactorily in other States.
                              Mr. GIVAN. So far from being in the interests of miners and
                                   manufacturers, the bill is rather in opposition to their wishes.
                                   Considering the peril of the lives of the coal miners, and their
                                   number--which is being increased continually--I hope the motion
                                   of the gentleman from Knox (Mr. Cauthorn) will not prevail.
                              Mr. PEED. I trust that this measure will not be urged too hastily.
                                   This is a measure of too much importance to be put through
                                   without careful consideration. It is true we have a large mining
                                   interest in the State, but capitalists have but recently opened
                                   our coal mines in my region. The passage of this bill, in my
                                   opinion, will drive capitalists from our mines and hinder their
                                   development. There is such a thing as going too far, and I think
                                   this bill is going too far. It is a system of red tape. It
                                   can't be enforced. It lays a burden on the mining
                                   interests that ought not to attach to them. Whilst those engaged
                                   in the mines ought to be secured in their lives, yet we ought not
                                   to pass a law that will involve parties engaged in the mining
                                   interest in interminable litigations. So far as my information
                                   goes, all the provisions of the bill with regard to ventillation
                                   are uncalled for. I understand that in all the mines there in
                                   ample provision as to this matter. What we want is a wholesome,
                                   equal law that will protect capital as well as life.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley. We have hundreds of workmen in the mines who
                                   are wholly unprotected in their lives. Our mining interests are
                                   yet young, and we may have the benefit of the experience of
                                   mining and miners in Pennsylvania and other mining States, and I
                                   think this, founded in mining experience, is a just bill. I think
                                   the life and health of the citizen is a consideration higher than
                                   any mining interest. The Judiciary Committee
                                   understood that this bill meets the approval of miners and those
                                   in the mining interest as well as the workmen in the mines. The
                                   workmen were before the committee, but the capitalists--the
                                   miners, were not. I hope the bill will pass--at least that the
                                   House will not take such action as will defeat it.
                              Mr. COFFMAN. This bill is of too much importance to be passed
                                   without due consideration of all the interests involved.
                              Mr. WILLARD. We have coal fields underlying large bodies of land,
                                   and this is a new interest in the State of Indiana. I am opposed
                                   to hampering with legislation any great public interest in its
                                   inception, and I am opposed to placing a law on the statute book,
                                   the practical workings of which we do not know. I have received
                                   letters from enterprising parties who are afraid of this bill. I
                                   claim that not only the laboring, but the manufacturing interests
                                   should receive protection. The manufacturers of my county regard
                                   this bill with alarm, and we should at least give to them the
                                   right to examine it and see how it will affect their
                                   interests.
                              Mr. DIAL. Whilst I am not willing to prevent capital from opening
                                   the coal mines, I would give immediate relief to the mine
                                   workers, so far as the protection of their lives are concerned.
                                   Four laborers have recently lost their lives in consequence of
                                   the foul air in the mines where they were employed. I see nothing
                                   in this bill that can interfere with the rights of the owners of
                                   coal mines, or that would interfere with the opening of the
                                   mines. But it is certainly a paramount object and duty in
                                   legislation, and first of all to protect life. We have hundreds
                                   of men in the State who are obliged to resort to this species of
                                   labor for a livelihood--to seek their living in the mines far
                                   beneath the surface; and there is not a season passes in which many lives are not lost in
                                   our coal mines. I have received letters from my people appealing
                                   to the Legislature for God's sake to pass a bill of this
                                   kind for the protection of the lives of laborers in the mines. I
                                   think that all owners and workers of mines should be compelled to
                                   keep them in a condition that shall not endanger the health and
                                   life of their laborers.
                              Mr. THAYER considered it an important proposition, and might be
                                   made for the benefit of all the interests concerned.
                              Mr. SCHMUCK. Every man from the coal mining districts is in favor
                                   of it.
                              Mr. THAYER. That is correct, I believe; but the manufacturing
                                   interests of the State are just beginning to be developed, and we
                                   are not yet acquainted, hardly--certainly not familiar with this
                                   matter. Therefore we ought to go slowly with this thing. I
                                   can't see any harm that could result from allowing it to
                                   pass over to the next session. The history of coal mines
                                   disasters in the recent past makes this legislation an important
                                   duty, and I shall do all I can to secure the passage of a good
                                   bill.
                              Mr. BAXTER. I have taken the pains to examine the Pennsylvania
                                   mining law, and it is much more stringent than this, and they
                                   find it positively necessary for the protection of life. And
                                   since the Pennsylvania law has been in operation, these several
                                   years, its necessity has been demonstrated in the diminution of
                                   the destruction of life by the mines. Therefore, I think we ought
                                   to pass this bill at once for the protection of the lives of
                                   those who go down into the mines of our own State.
                              On the motion of Mr. WOLFLIN, Mr. Cauthorn's motion to
                                   recommit the bill with instructions was laid on the table, and
                                   the question recurred on the final passage.
                              Mr. RENO. I believe that this bill ought to pass for the benefit of
                                   the coal interests. If the laborers in the mines were protected,
                                   it would not only draw more men but more capital to the mines of
                                   our State. Men will not go where they are not safe in their
                                   lives, and capital cannot operate the mines without laborers. We
                                   hold the railroads liable for trifling with life, and why not
                                   other monied interests? Relieving that it will benefit the entire
                                   mining interest, I hope the bill will pass.
                              Mr. COWGILL, I hope the bill will not be voted down. If I thought
                                   it would fail now I would not press it, but I do not think so.
                                   The object is to protect mining, and whilst it will protect the
                                   laborer it will not, in any way, interfere with capital. He
                                   referred particularly to some of the provisions of the bill, to
                                   establish his opinion, and added, Because we have no such law in
                                   Indiana, many of the best miners of the State have gone to those
                                   States where they have such a law.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. I would prefer to have this bm over to the next
                                   session. I submit this objection to it. The Governor
                                   can't appoint the proposed examiner except upon the
                                   recommendation of the mine owners. The bill would be
                                   compulsory--compelling the Governor to submit to the dictation of
                                   the miners. I would readily vote for a proposition to protect the
                                   lives of the mine laborers, and also to protect the mine owners.
                                   But we find that by the provisions of this bill, not only that
                                   the Governor's selection is subordinated to the will of
                                   the miners, but the five local examiners to be appointed by the
                                   local court judge are to be such as the miners shall select. I am
                                   opposed to these provisions of the bill.
                              Mr. GIVAN. I find that the owners of mines are liable to both civil
                                   and criminal actions for failure to comply with the provisions of
                                   this bill. It seems to me, therefore, that if the bill prsses it
                                   ought to be without the emergency clause; for I am persuaded that
                                   many mine owners are not in a condition to comply with its
                                   provisions at once.
                              Mr. MELLETT. I have not examined the bill critically, but I am
                                   satisfied that its provisions are copied from the mining laws of
                                   mining countries. I shall therefore support it as it
                                   is--emergency and all. As to the suggestion that the miners will
                                   have the thing very much in their own hands, I would say that the
                                   miners are in this interest. It is for their health and the
                                   protection of their lives that the bill is designed, and they are
                                   the very men to make these selections. If my health or life were
                                   at stake, and the law proposed to furnish me relief in this way,
                                   I should not think of applying to any lawyer or judge to direct
                                   my choice as to my own examiner. So I think in this case, that
                                   the regular miners should have the selection of the officers to
                                   carry out the provisions of laws for their protection. The mining
                                   statistics show that 2,500 men have lost their lives in the coal
                                   mines within the term of one year. In Pennsylvania, there was one
                                   life for every 13,000 tons of coal. Such was the risk of life
                                   there prior to the passage of their mining law in 1870--five
                                   lives for every 65,000 tons; now it is one life for every 65,000
                                   tons. It may look, at the first, like a hardship on capital, but
                                   let us look first at the destruction of life and the pre- vention. It has been but a
                                   short time since we all read the description and report of that
                                   scene on one of the mountains of Pennsylvania, where one hundred
                                   wives stood over the ruins of a mine, waiting for the dead bodies
                                   of their husbands to be exhumed. The miners are in danger all the
                                   time--as well in the day time, whilst we are sitting here, as in
                                   the night when we sleep--and it seems to me if there is to be any
                                   law passed to regulate this matter, there is no occasion for
                                   delay.
                              Mr. MILLER There is one thing which I think the friends of this
                                   bill ought to agree to. I think it prudent and proper that any
                                   general law which makes the doing or not doing of it a criminal
                                   offence should not be passed with a clause of emergency.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley. There is a provision in the bill fixing
                                   three months from its passage for the time of its taking
                                   effect.
                              Mr. MILLER. Perhaps that would answer. But it is certain that, in
                                   the absence of all experience in legislation on this subject
                                   here, we must look elsewhere for information; and we know of no
                                   better place to go than to look at the laws of other States that
                                   have had the greatest experience in mining. Pennsylvania has had
                                   a mining experience of a hundred years, and we may presume that
                                   her mining laws have been brought to as great a degree of
                                   perfection as we shall have arrived at a hundred years hence; and
                                   after all her experience there still comes upon Pennsylvania the
                                   Scranton disaster. The States of Ohio and Pennsylvania have been
                                   at work on their mining laws. Ohio passed hers in 1871, and
                                   Pennsylvania hers a few years before; and this bill is copied
                                   from these sources. So the committee that reported it do not
                                   claim any originality. As to the provision for the appointment of
                                   a commissioner and of mine inspectors by the Governor and the
                                   local judges--that was taken from the Pennsylvania law. It was
                                   desirable to take these appointments entirely out of politics;
                                   and being myself in favor of the Civil Service Reform, I have no
                                   doubt that we could do nothing better than to adopt this
                                   provision. The bill has been printed and on our tables for some
                                   time; but still, if gentlemen are satisfied I am willing that it
                                   should go over to the next session.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. I see the Chairman of the Judiciary
                                        Committee (Mr. Walker) has just come in, and I
                                   would like to hear him state what he knows about it.
                              Mr WALKER. When this bill was first referred to the
                                        Judiciary Committee, I was informed that
                                   it was a compromize bill between the proprietors of the mines and
                                   the mine laborers; and we thought that if it were such a
                                   compromize it would satisfy us. Alter that some parties came to
                                   some of the members of the committee and said that the mine
                                   proprietors desired to be further heard on this bill. Then there
                                   was a telegraphic dispatch from the miners in Clay, telling that
                                   they desired to be heard. It was addressed to the gentleman from
                                   Marion.
                              Mr. JOHNSON. Owners of mines?
                              Mr. KIMBALL Some did and some did not claim to be owners.
                              Mr. WALKER. It was then understood that the miners should all have
                                   the opportunity of being heard. That promise was made. I am in
                                   favor of this bill, and ready for its passage; but it is proper
                                   that I should state to the House that the committee was willing
                                   that both sides should be represented before them. I am very much
                                   in favor of the bill.
                              Mr. WOLFLIN. That despatch was sent two weeks ago, and none of them
                                   have appeared before the committee. I hope the bill will pass.
                                   Then where the mines are made safe, men will find out such places
                                   and prefer to work there, so that they may even reduce the wages
                                   of miners in a safe place.
                              Mr. COWGILL. Of these examiners, four of them must be practical
                                   miners, and the five may be owners or operators.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. In the 20th line of section 10, it is provided that no
                                   person shall be appointed Inspector unless he is a citizen of the
                                   State and has had practical experience in working the coal mines
                                   of the State. Now I can see how a man may have had this practical
                                   experience in other States; and yet, no matter how desirable it
                                   may be, the Governor can't appoint him.
                              Mr. COWGILL. That might perhaps as well have been left out; but it
                                   is not likely that there will be any difficulty on account of
                                   that limitation.
                              On the demand of Mr. THOMPSON of Elkhart, the previous question
                                   brought the final vote and the bill passed the House--yeas 67,
                                   nays 8--with an amendment of title, adding these words:
                                   "providing for the appointment of mine inspectors and a
                                   commissioner; providing punishment for the violations of this
                                   act, and fixing the time when this act shall take
                                   effect," proposed by Mr. Miller.
                              So the bill passed on the part of the House of Representatives.
                         
                         
                              LEGISLATIVE APPORTIONMENT--A PROTEST.
                              Mr. HARDESTY called for the reading of the protest of certain
                                   members of the  House
                                   (Democrats) who voted against the State Legislative Apportionment
                                   bill, [S. 146] which finally passed the House yesterday. It is as
                                   follows:
                              We, the undersigned members of the House, hereby enter our solemn
                                   protest against the act entitled, "An act to fix the
                                   number of Senators and Representatives to the General Assembly of
                                   the State of Indiana, and to apportion the same among the several
                                   counties of tho State, and declaring an emergency," and
                                   demand that our protest, with our reasons for dissent, be entered
                                   on the Journal.
                              The reasons we assign for the protest are as follows:
                              First. That in our opinion the said act is a deliberate fraud and
                                   imposition upon the rights and privileges of the people of the
                                   State of Indiana.
                              Second. Because said act is a deliberate attempt to sap the very
                                   foundation of representative government by denying equal and fair
                                   representation to the people in the General Assembly.
                              Third. Because it is a shameful violation of that American doctrine
                                   that comes down to us from the Revolution, canonized by the blood
                                   of our patriot fathers, that taxation and representation shall go
                                   hand in hand.
                              Fourth. Because said act is an infamy, passed at the bidding of an
                                   unscrupulous partisan influence, and can not be defended upon any
                                   principle of common right, and was passed with indecent haste
                                   under the pressure of the previous question, so that debate was
                                   prevented and no opportunity afforded to expose its glaring
                                   defects.
                              Fifth. Because said act is a plain and palpable violation of the
                                   Constitution of the State of Indiana, which requires that
                                   Senators and Representatives in the General Assembly shall be
                                   apportioned among the several counties, according to the number
                                   of inhabitants, under the enumeration made by law, which
                                   provision of the Constitution is wholly disregarded and violated
                                   by the said act, and it is therefore null and void.

                                   J. T. Richardson,
                                   M. L. Brett,
                                   James H. Willard.
                              
                              Mr. THAYER. I move to amend the protest so that it will apply to
                                   the apportionment bill offered here two years ago.
                              The SPEAKER. The motion is not in order.
                              Mr. LENFESTY submitted the following:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             WHEREAS, This House did, on
                                                  yesterday, the 19th day of December, A. D. 1872,
                                                  grant to certain members of this body the right to
                                                  place upon the journal a written protest against a
                                                  part of the legislative action of this House;
                                                  and
                                             WHEREAS, Said written protest
                                                  with reference to that part of our legislation
                                                  known as the apportionment bills, has been placed
                                                  on the journal; and
                                             WHEREAS, The said protest is
                                                  violent in its character and greatly abuses the
                                                  privileges granted calling in question tho motives
                                                  of members of this body, and is a breach of that
                                                  decorum due from one side of the House to the
                                                  other, therefore, in view of the facts as above
                                                  set forth, be it
                                             RESOLVED By this House that we
                                                  deprecate the language of said protest, and the
                                                  spirit which dictated the same, and that said
                                                  protest should receive the unqualified disapproval
                                                  of every well-meaning member of this body, and
                                                  that said protestants for the grave abuse of the
                                                  privilege granted them, should receive the censure
                                                  of this House.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              The SPEAKER. Any member shall have the right to enter his
                                   protest--that is the right to have it entered on the
                                   journal--that is a constitutional provision.
                              Mr. KIMBALL conceded freely the right of any member to protest
                                   against any action of the House, and would have been even glad to
                                   see the right exercised in this case, if the protest had been
                                   made in language becoming gentlemen. But the language of the
                                   protest charging dishonor and disregard of law and right against
                                   the majority, was such that he felt called upon by the sense of
                                   duty and self-respect to denounce it in the face of all the
                                   opposition that might be brought to bear against him; and he did
                                   denounce it as a dishonor and disparagement to the body and all
                                   concerned in it. He proceeded with earnest and rapid utterances
                                   to declare that it would be unbecoming in the majority, and that
                                   it would be a thing also which their constituents would not
                                   approve, for the majority to sit here with their lips closed and
                                   their tongues paralyzed while they were denounced in this way as
                                   a set of dishonorable scoundrels for their solemn official action
                                   taken under the sanctions of the oath of God.
                              Mr. ----- . So far as I am concerned I have nothing to say further
                                   than this: I did not sign the paper without reading it, but since
                                   the reading of it here I am better pleased with it than I was
                                   before. We have not a fair showing on the apportionment, and as
                                   members of this body--as Democrats--we have the right to protest
                                   and denounce the proceeding of the majority.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY. It may be that we have used language quite severe: but
                                   I will say to the gentleman from Marion that a member of this
                                   House and of his own party, standing with us at the time, said
                                   that the bill was an outrage on the rights of the people. And
                                   when they tell me that if they were of the minority they would
                                   not tolerate it--
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, interrupted with a point of order. It is out
                                   of order to call words in question, or to comment on the matured
                                   prior acts of members on this floor.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY. I will say then that we placed our protest there,
                                   believing that we are justified in what we say, and we ask that the resolution pending
                                   be declared out of order.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley. I regret that gentlemen have presented it in
                                   the language they have. I know that, personally, between
                                   themselves and myself, there is good feeling. I do not believe
                                   they would accuse me personally of any act that they would esteem
                                   as improper or denounce as shameful.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY; The gentleman has no right to call in question the
                                   motives of the minority.
                              Mr. WILSON. I am not: I am complimenting them. But as far as this
                                   protest is concerned, that is not an act of the House, and we
                                   have a right to comment on it. No deliberative body ought to
                                   permit a minority to cast a direct insult on the majority, or the
                                   House; and this protest is as much an insult to the minority as
                                   to the majority. It is one of the plainest principles of
                                   parliamentary law that none have the right to impugn the motives
                                   of gentlemen in debate; yet these parties go to the extent of
                                   arraigning the motives that prompted the action of the House; and
                                   that far I am in favor of wiping it out--wiping out the stain
                                   that is attempted to be cast upon the House. I grant the right of
                                   protest, but not the right of personal imputations. The simple
                                   question before the House is, whether we will allow a deliberate
                                   insult to remain on the record. I say that this is sought to be
                                   done--and I say it with all due respect to the protesting
                                   gentlemen. It it is better to protest in a just and truthful
                                   account of the action of the House, whether they believe it true
                                   or not. It is a breach of decorum to charge dishonor upon the
                                   journal. If we did not observe this decorum it would be
                                   impossible to do business. These rules have been established by
                                   experience. Legislative bodies can't do without them.
                                   This protest comes in writing. As I understand the constitution,
                                   an individual member may protest for hfrnself; and this House
                                   granted to the gentleman from Morgan and Johnson (Mr. Shirley) to
                                   submit his protest and have it placed on the journal. But after
                                   this bill [S. 146] had become law these gentlemen come in, and
                                   sign their protest in disregard of the rule against any
                                   reflection on the prior action and determination of the House.
                                   Then, so far as this is concerned, with respect to every member
                                   except the gentleman from Morgan and Johnson, it is a reflection
                                   upon the prior action of the House.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY. I claimed the right to protest for myself and the
                                   minority.
                              Mr. WILSON. The gentleman can protest for himself, not on the
                                   behalf the minority.
                              Mr. RENO. I am sorry this discussion has come up. I am a young
                                   member here, but I desire to say that I believe all men on this
                                   floor act honestly. I trust and believe both sides of the House,
                                   as a body are honorable men, and I think the sooner we drop this
                                   discussion the better. It is in this way that men get heated and
                                   passionate--they will not be moved by attempted compulsions--they
                                   will stand as the rock of Gibraltar--they will warm up with
                                   passion, and give utterance to language as bad as ours in the
                                   protest--and this will go to the country. But the people are
                                   perfectly cool. It is only ourselves that are excited. The people
                                   and the newspapers will weigh the matter coolly, and perhaps
                                   laugh at us, and there will be the end on't.
                              Mr. BILLINGSLEY. As a member of this House I feel willing that the
                                   protest should go on the journal, simply with the understanding
                                   that the privilege of protest was given only to the gentlemen
                                   from Morgan and Johnson.
                              Mr. LENFESTY. I did not desire to say anything with reference to
                                   this resolution. I had my attention called to the protest, and I
                                   must say that it struck me as very unjust, and I have no doubt
                                   that many signed it without knowing what the paper contained,
                                   which is certrinly wrong. The gentleman over the way (Mr. Reno)
                                   says, that in the heat of passion we will say things against the
                                   dignity of the body, but that is just the thing we would repress.
                                   I can stand by and hear gentlemen in the heat of debate and look
                                   on calmly. But here is a protest that is to go on the journal,
                                   and remain there for history; and I say it is due to the House
                                   and the minority that it should be withdrawn. If this is not
                                   done, in after years, when we cast our eyes over the pages of the
                                   journal and rest them upon this protest, we will say that, not
                                   only the majority here, but the minority also were disgraced by
                                   it. I say this in sorrow that such a thing has appeared. I say,
                                   let the protest be withdrawn, and let gentlemen put on the pages
                                   of the journal something that will reflect their views
                                   better.
                              Mr. JOHNSON. I am satisfied that gentlemen will regard this as an
                                   unfit protest when they come to look at it coolly. I confess that
                                   I was surprised when I looked at the wording of it. I was shocked
                                   at the very first sentence. It is this: "In our opinion
                                   the said act is a deliberate fraud and imposition on the rights
                                   and privileges of the people of the State." If they had said that it was
                                   an act of injustice, done in excitement--in the haste and
                                   excitement of party feeling--but this is not the form of the
                                   expression. The words here are: "It is a deliberate
                                   fraud." That charges every member of the majority with
                                   whom I stand with deliberate fraud fraud with
                                   consideration--fraud that habit has permitted. It charges a
                                   deliberate intention to perpetrate a fraud and imposition--not on
                                   the rights of the minority on this floor--that would have been a
                                   compromise--but a deliberate fraud on the people of the State!
                                   Then this protest, in its first assertion, is false, and this
                                   first expression is one with reference to which a resolution
                                   ought to be filed, that it is expunged from these records. This
                                   sentence is so bad that if a private individual were to utter it
                                   against another private individual it would lay the perpetrator
                                   of it liable for damages. Here is a charge of corruption and
                                   fraud more turbid than I am willing to rest under.
                              Sir, I stand here, not as an individual, and if I do stand here as
                                   an individual, yet before this House I stand as one of the
                                   representatives of the people of a great county of the State of
                                   Indiana, and when I am charged with public fraud, the charge
                                   reaches back to the people I represent. Therefore I hurl the
                                   charge back, as a charge against my colleagues and my people. And
                                   I know that I shall be sustained in this by my people. It is a
                                   charge against me personally and against the people I represent.
                                   It is an insult to every gentleman on this floor, and through
                                   their representatives it is insulting to the people of Indiana.
                                   The second reason for the protest is this: "Because said
                                   act is a deliberate attempt to sap the very foundation of
                                   representative government." My colleague (Mr. Kimball)
                                   has said that when we came in here we took an oath to support the
                                   constitution of the United States and of this State. Then here is
                                   another grave charge without a word of qualification--a charge of
                                   trampling on the principles of free government--a charge of
                                   action against a crowning principle of the constitution--a charge
                                   of violation of the oath we took. That is another insult to the
                                   House and to the people, and as such this House ought to have the
                                   privilege of wiping it out. It says, further: "Third.
                                   Because it is a shameful violation of that American doctrine that
                                   comes down to us from the Revolution, canonized by the blood of
                                   our patriot fathers, that taxation and representation should go
                                   hand in hand." Mr. Speaker, it was in the power of the
                                   majority to have done injustice to the minority, but I speak what
                                   I know when I say, that in that caucus of Republican members
                                   where this measure was matured, I know that no Demccrat could
                                   have uttered sentiments more just and magnanimous towards the
                                   minority--no Democrat could have represented and protected their
                                   rights more carefully, safely and ably than they were represented
                                   and protected in that caucus. Sir, the majority here is not
                                   unjust. Whilst inequalities may be pointed out anywhere, almost,
                                   in any such bill, not one point of injustice was found. I think
                                   the majority will bear me out in saying this further, that in
                                   that consultation I, myself, stood by the rights of the minority,
                                   and in some cases where there was injustice I said so, and the
                                   instant that injustice was pointed out it was corrected; and
                                   gentlemen all around me in that caucus,--the Speaker of the House
                                   amongst them--said, repeatedly, this provision and that provision
                                   is unjust to the minority--we can't afford to be
                                   unjust.
                              No gentleman of the majority will deny this, my assertion, here.
                                   These expressions were frequently and constantly made in caucus,
                                   and therefore I say to the minority in this protest, that they
                                   have done themselves the dishonor to insult their best friends, I
                                   felt that I was standing in that caucus in their interests, and
                                   now, being insulted, as I am, and those others with me, I ask the
                                   minority to withdraw this protest because it does injustice to
                                   their friends--casts an insult into the face of those who have
                                   stood by them. I ask them to do this for their own self respect,
                                   as well as out of regard for those who have stood by them. I have
                                   no objection to the protest itself, but my notice goes to the
                                   infamous and unparliamentary language of it. Let the protest be
                                   decorous, and it insults no one. I know fifty-two honest men who
                                   voted for this bill--not one of them voted dishonestly. Mr.
                                   Speaker, I might go on further to notice this paper, but I shall
                                   not. I think the protest ill-advised, improper and unwise, and I
                                   know it is unjust to almost every member of the majority side. I
                                   tell the minority that their rights were not disregarded--not
                                   confided to an unreasoning or unfeeling party. I tell them that
                                   everything that could have been said in their behalf by the
                                   ablest of them was said in that caucus. If the minority will not
                                   withdraw their paper, I think it is due, not only to the dignity
                                   of the House, but to our constituents, that this protest should
                                   be expunged from the records of the house. It represents a state
                                         of feeling which never
                                   existed on this floor Therefore, I appeal to the minority, as I
                                   appealed to the majority--we cannot afford to do what is unjust.
                                   I will say again, that we do not want to dictate the terms and
                                   forms of speech in a protest, but we want the violent,
                                   inflammatory, and (I will say again) unjust language of it to be
                                   removed; and that it should be at least respectful, and have some
                                   of the elements of truth in it.
                              Mr. BARRETT. I am in a good humor, We are near the close of the
                                   session, and nothing should excite us unwisely. Whilst I would
                                   prefer a little modification of the language of the protest, so
                                   far as its truthfulness is concerned, I would not change it.
                              Mr. KIMBALL (interposing.) I would like to know what the gentleman
                                   means by truth? There is perhaps one truth there that I pronounce
                                   a falsehood--that we acted fraudulently--that is false.
                              Mr. BARRETT. What I mean by truth in this matter is the statement
                                   that there is not in the apportionment bill a distribution of
                                   representatives amongst the counties according to population: The
                                   gentleman from Marion (Mr. Kimball) says he has taken an oath
                                   before the Judge of the Supreme Court to support the constitution
                                   and do his duty, and we all did that; and I leave it to the minds
                                   and consciences of gentlemen whether they did make that
                                   apportionment according to that oath--whether they did make it as
                                   duty, and right, and justice require, and according to the
                                   constitution, which says that the several counties shall have
                                   representation according to population? whether instead of doing
                                   so, they did not give to some counties with less than 4,000, and
                                   less than 3,000 voters, a full representative, whilst another
                                   county, with nearly 5,000 voters, has only a half representative?
                                   And, again, I think at least one gentleman of the majority, (Mr.
                                   Branham) used almost the same language of the protest, not,
                                   indeed, towards members, but with reference to the bill
                                   itself.
                              Mr. JOHNSON. That language of the gentlemen was directed to the
                                   bill as it was first read in the House--it was not against the
                                   amended bill.
                              Mr. BARRETT. As to representation according to population, I do not
                                   know that the amendment made it any better.
                              Mr. WESNER moved for an adjournment.
                              Mr. Kimball desired the gentleman from Boone to withdraw the
                                   motion, and it was accordingly withdrawn.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY. I have not desired to incurred the displeasure of any
                                   gentleman of the House, and friendly relations have arisen
                                   amongst us, and these relations have been maintained even beyond
                                   my anticipations till this thing got into the House. We may have
                                   used too severe language in the protest; but, sir, the language
                                   of the majority has been equally severe and equally as unguarded
                                   as that of the protest; and some of them have gone beyond what is
                                   in the protest in the severity of their denunciations. And
                                   notwithstanding it has been whitewashed, (As I apprehended it
                                   would be) yet in my judgment, it was unjustly addressed to the
                                   minority; and therefore, I think we could be justified in putting
                                   on the record what they have said themselves. But still if the
                                   protest is too severe, I will say that I do not wish to offer an
                                   insult to any member, either by record or word in debate, whilst
                                   at the same time I do think that the majority could reflect
                                   dispassionately and unselfishly upon their treatment of the
                                   minority, they would themselves feel that we have had just cause
                                   for what we have said. Considering it merely as a question of
                                   decorum, I am willing to change it; yet I have my convictions
                                   about the bill, and no expunging of records change them. Sir, you
                                   can't wipe out the fact of injustice from the memory of
                                   the people! It may be, as the gentle man from Marion (Mr.
                                   Johnson) claims, that our rights were defended in their caucus. I
                                   do not know what then might have been our condition if we had
                                   been without any defence there! Could they, with any regard to
                                   the Constitution, have made the representation more unequal?
                                   Could they have made it worse as between the counties of Marion
                                   and Allen? Allen, with a greater voting population than Marion,
                                   one Senator and two Representatives, whilst Marion has two
                                   Senators and four Representatives, and one Senator more jointly
                                   with Morgan? and one Representative more jointly with SheIby? And
                                   there are many puch cases where representation has not been given
                                   as the Constitution prescribes. But as I have said: i am willing
                                   to change the words of the protest, whilst I must insist on
                                   retaining the substance and matter.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. I am glad to hear the gentleman from Morgan and
                                   Johnson (Mr Shirley) speak as he has now spoken. Though I found
                                   fault with some of the expressions he made use of--I presume he
                                   is the author of the protest - I am glad to know that he is
                                   willing to withdraw the offensive language. It is all the
                                   majority ask of him. Every man here accords the right of protest
                                   as to principle, and, as to any gentleman's individual opinions, he can be heard
                                   and he can answer outside of the House. I would not throw any
                                   obstruction in the way of the protest on the part of the
                                   minority. I desire that they may be heard on the journal. Sir, I
                                   like to see gentlemen coming in here and claiming a just
                                   hearing--men with whom for years our personal intercourse has
                                   been such that I could say they are my friends. I like to see men
                                   striving for their right to do what they think ought to be done;
                                   and I am sorry only that the language of the protest was such as
                                   to raise an objection. But as the objectionable style is
                                   withdrawn, I am willing that they should have every word on the
                                   journal which gentlemen may deem necessary.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN As to the claim that the matter of the protest is
                                   wrong, and the bill right, I deny that. There is something else
                                   in that count. But I am free to say that with regard to that
                                   apportionment bill there may be honest differences of opinion.
                                   The gentleman from Marion (Mr. Johnson) says the bill is right,
                                   and I am willing to give him credit for candor, but there are
                                   others who may say that it is not right, not fair. That is my
                                   opinion, sir, and I am as honest about it as you are, and I am
                                   willing to go before the people of the State on that question. I
                                   will say further, that there is something in that pro-test and
                                   the objections to it that we might know more about than has yet
                                   appeared on this floor. Some have alleged that members of the
                                   majority here have asserted that they would not have voted for
                                   that bill but to keep their standing in the party. I can freely
                                   say that no gentleman has told me so, but gentlemen have told me
                                   that certain of the majority had said so; and if they have said
                                   so, then I say there is nothing in the protest that ought not to
                                   be there. And I will undertake to say that in the passage of that
                                   bill the constitution of the State has been shamelessly violated.
                                   We complain that the Legislative Apportionment is not equal, and
                                   hold you to the requisition which should have compelled you to
                                   distribute the Representatives fairly among all the counties of
                                   the State. Mr. C. was proceeding, by statements and figures to
                                   show some of the inequalities and glaring defects of the bill; as
                                   for the counties of Knox and Sullivan, (a Democratic district)
                                   with a voting population of 9,254, is given one Senator and two
                                   Representatives, whilst Lawrence and Monroe, (a Republican
                                   district) with a voting population of 6,616,are given the same
                                   representation, with a voting population 2,608 less than Knox and
                                   Sullivan. As between the districts composed of Floyd and Clark
                                   and Parke and Vermillion, there is a disparity of 3,581 against
                                   the Democratic district of Floyd and Clark. Dearborn and
                                   Franklin, with a voting population of 10,048 are given a smaller
                                   representation than Miami and Howard with 1,500 less--when he was
                                   interrupted by--
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley. It seems to me that the proper subject of
                                   discussion is the language of the protest.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN. I have said all I intended. I am not impugning the
                                   honest motives of any gentleman on this floor. I am willing to
                                   concede that they thought they were acting right. When my friend
                                   from Marion (Mr. Johnson) said the bill is right, I believe he
                                   told the truth as he regarded the bill; but I think he was
                                   influenced and biased by partisan feeling. If there is anything
                                   in the protect that wounds the feelings of gentlemen, I am
                                   willing to withdraw it. I will renew the motion to adjourn.
                                   [Voices--"No, no."] Then I withdraw it.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. The protest is on the journal, and I am willing it
                                   should remain there if gentlemen take away the objectionable
                                   language.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY. You can't strike out the protest.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. Protest as you please, God bless you, but
                                   don't insult me with your protests.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY [aside.] Don't insult me with your bills.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. Whilst the majority have not the right to strike out
                                   the protest, the minority have not the right to protest in
                                   unparliamentary style. I do not say that the majority have the
                                   right to dictate the withdrawal ; but, if it suits the minority,
                                   I desire that the protest should be withdrawn [Consent,
                                   consent"--from Democratic benches.] I desire to say
                                   also, that when it was passed to rne, I saw its objectionable
                                   words, and I think that by getting together to-night we can
                                   embody our views and give them a proper expression.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY. We do not withdraw the protest.
                              The SPEAKER. The Constitution gives the right of protest.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. Before I ask that this protest be withdrawn, I desire
                                   to ask the gentleman from Grant (Mr. Lenfesty) to withdraw his
                                   resolution. ["Consent," consent," from
                                   the benches on both sides.]
                              The resolution and the protest were withdrawn accordingly by
                                   unanimous consent.
                         
                         
                         
                              NEW STATE CAPITOL.
                              Mr. BRANHAM, from the Select Committee on Plans for a new
                                        State House, submitted a preamble and resolution
                                   reciting that the Joint Special Committee
                                   heretofore appointed to receive plans and specifications for a
                                   new State Capitol building, have organized and come to the
                                   conclusion that with their present authority it will be
                                   impracticable and impossible for them to accomplish the object
                                   sought by the General Assembly, and therefore they recommend the
                                   adoption of a concurrent resolution offering -------- dollars for
                                   architectural plans and specifications, which may be accepted by
                                   the General Assembly and used in the construction of the new
                                   Capitol, to wit: -------- dollars for the best plans and
                                   specifications so offered, accepted and used: -------- dollars
                                   for the second best; and -------- dollars for the third best; and
                                   authorizing paid Committee to visit other State Capitols for the
                                   purpose of enabling them to discharge their duty properly, and
                                   allowing to each of them the per diem of a member of the General
                                   Assembly for the time so employed together with their travelling
                                   expenses: provided that they shall not pay for any plan not
                                   accepted by the General Assembly.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. It was the unanimous opinion of the committee that,
                                   under the former resolution of the House for State House plans,
                                   it would not be in their power to get the information required,
                                   especially in the short time allowed to them; and if the House
                                   wishes anything; done in the matter they should pass the
                                   resolution we have reported. So far as that is concerned this
                                   whole matter is with the House. The original resolution was
                                   handed to me last night, and the committee met to-day. I am
                                   perfectly willing if the House should come to that conclusion,
                                   that the whole matter should be laid on the table. The House
                                   requires the committee to report at the next session; and
                                   consequently the committee believe it will put off any plan for
                                   the capitol for two years longer. The idea is that all plans
                                   shall be submitted to the General Assembly. But I say again, if
                                   it is the wish of the House I am perfectly willing that the whole
                                   subject should be laid on the table. The State of Michigan has
                                   built a State House recently, and for her plans and
                                   specifications she has paid $35,000. The committee propose to
                                   fill these blanks for the amounts proposed to be paid for plans
                                   and specifications--the first with $1,000, the second with $600
                                   and the third with $400. The reason for this classification of
                                   the plans and specifications is this: Some architect might
                                   propose a plan for ventillation which might be adopted in
                                   preference to that which might belong to the plan adopted for the
                                   main building. The State can use any part of any one of the
                                   plans, or combine the three. The committee thought it might be
                                   well to visit the capitols of the States of Tennessee and
                                   Michigan.
                              Mr. THOMPSON, of Elkhart. I am opposed to paying for plans and
                                   specifications in this way. I think it would be better to employ
                                   an architect.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. I wish to state that the State of Michigan paid
                                   $35,000 for their State House plans, and the State had the right
                                   to employ whomsoever she pleased to superintend the work. I
                                   believe the architects charge five per cent. of the cost for plan
                                   and superintendence, which would be about $50,000. I move to fill
                                   the first blank with $1,000.
                              The motion was agreed to, and on the further motion of Mr. B. the
                                   remaining blanks were filled with $600 and $400, as before
                                   indicated by him.
                              And then, after Mr. Gregory's motion lay it on the table,
                                   the concurrent resolution was passed on the part of the House of
                                   Representatives--yeas, 58; nays, 20
                              A message was received from the Senate announcing non-concurrence
                                   in the report of the conference committee on
                                   the Senate bill No. 166, and asking the appointment of a new
                                        Committee of Conference.
                              On motion of Mr. WALKER, the House responded to the request of the
                                   Senate by the adoption of an order for the appointment of another
                                        Conference Committee to consider the
                                   disagreeing votes of the two houses with reference to amendments
                                   to the Senate bill No. 166, and the Speaker appointed the
                                   committee, viz.: Messrs. Walker and Thayer.
                              Mr. BLOCHER moved for the adjournment, which was modified by Mr.
                                   GIFFORD so as to make "the adjournment" a
                                   recess till half-past seven o'clock to-night, and so the
                                   order was adopted.
                         
                         
                              STATE HOUSE PLANS.
                              Mr. BOWSER. I move to reconsider the vote on the adoption of the
                                   resolution of the gentleman from Jefferson, (Mr. Branham) just
                                   reported by him from the Special Committee on State
                                        House Plans. I can't see the wisdom of
                                   employing architects so long as no action is taken for the new
                                   State Capitol. It is pretty certain that the plans and
                                   specifications of the architects taken at this time, would not be
                                   suitable for adoption twenty years hence; and I can't
                                   see the propriety of throwing away two or three thousand dollars for
                                   plans that may never be adopted.
                              Mr. GREGORY. It strikes me, Mr. Speaker, that you are setting men
                                   to look after these plans who might not know any better how to
                                   build a house than a string of black suckers. I can't
                                   see any necessity for the committee at all.
                              Mr. KIMBALL. The object is to require the Committee to visit and
                                   examine buildings, and to get plans. I move to lay the motion to
                                   reconsider on the table.
                              The motion was agree to.
                              The House took a recess till half-past seven o'clock p.
                                   m.
                         
                              
                         
                              NIGHT SESSION.
                              The SPEAKER resumed the chair at half-past seven
                                   o'clock.
                         
                         
                              TEMPERANCE.
                              Mr. THOMPSON, of Elkhart, and Mr. CLARK, presented temperance
                                   memorials, which were referred, under the rules.
                         
                         
                              THE CLERKS.
                              Mr. BILLINGSLEY submitted a resolution setting forth that the House
                                   had, on the 9th of the present month, passed an order requiring
                                   that a duplicate copy of the journal be made for the public
                                   printer, thereby imposing upon the clerks double work; and
                                   providing for an additional compensation to the Chief Clerk,
                                   Assistant Clerk, and their employes, of two and a half dollars
                                   per day since that date.
                              Mr. BRANHAM objected that in a case where the salary of an officer
                                   or employe is fixed by law it can only be increased by an
                                   act.
                              The SPEAKER, That decision has been made by previous Legislatures,
                                   I do not think it would be right to upset it.
                              Mr. BILLINGSLEY withdrew his resolution saying he wuld endeavor to
                                   have the progs amount incorporated in the next specific
                                   appropriation bill.
                         
                         
                              CANAL CERTIFICATES--THE CONSTITUTION.
                              On motion of Mr. WILLARD, the bill [S.159] to provide for
                                   submission to the qualified voters of the State, for their
                                   ratification or rejection, the proposition to amend the tenth
                                   article of the State Constitution, by adding a section in
                                   relation to the debt charged on the Wabash and Erie Canal (on the
                                   28th of January, 1873), was taken up on the second reading. He
                                   said: As yet it is uncertain whether the Legislature at the next
                                   session will decide to call a Constitutional Convention or not;
                                   and if they should not so decide, it is positively necessary that
                                   we should provide for the action of the people on this amendment.
                                   This bill provides that the people shall vote on the proposed
                                   canal certificates amendment question on the 28th of January,
                                   1873, and get it out of the way so that we may propose other
                                   needed amendments.
                              Mr. WALKER. The people might vote on this amendment, and on the
                                   question of calling a Constitutional Convention at the same
                                   time.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN. It was by my amendment to the joint resolution that
                                   this time was required for the ratification or rejection of this
                                   amendment by the people, and I think it better to stand by
                                   itself. It is best that the bill should pass and get it out of
                                   the way of other special amendments.
                              Mr. HELLER. It will be remembered that I have a bill to submit to
                                   the people the question of calling a Constitutional Convention,
                                   but I have not pressed its consideration. The present
                                   constitution was made in 1851; and we have grown up and prospered
                                   under that constitution as no other State has grown and prospered
                                   in that time. That being the case, it would seem that our State
                                   Constitution cannot need amendment very badly. We were able to
                                   take our full share of the burdens of the late civil war, and
                                   with so much distinction and public credit that a halo of
                                   national glory was hung all about us throughout the conflict. And
                                   now the war is past we are without debt There is a provision in
                                   the constitution whereby it may be amended specifically in every
                                   particular that may be desired by the people. There may be some
                                   occasion for the amendment proposed here, but I see no reason why
                                   we should be in a hurry about it. If there were any pressing
                                   necessity for it. I would with all ray heart go for the bill.
                                   Therefore, in the absence of better reasons for urging it, I am
                                   disposed to vote against the bill at this time.
                              Mr. MILLER I hope the House will permit it to pass over to the next
                                   session, for there is not time to mature and carry it out. And
                                   the thought has also suggested itself to my mind, that as the
                                   people have the first right to say whether or not they want a
                                   Constitutional Convention, it would be wise to submit that
                                   question with this at the same time.
                              The bill was passed over by unanimous consent.
                         
                         
                              INTEGRITY OF THE JOURNALS.
                              On motion of Mr. KIMBALL the bill [S. 165] relative to certain
                                   matters of Legislative
                                   practice in the two Houses of the General Assembly of Indiana,
                                   and declaring an emergency, was taken up on the first reading.
                                   (It provides for two Journal Committees of five members of each
                                   of the two Houses, with the President of the Senate and the
                                   Speaker of the House of Representatives for chairmen, to examine
                                   the journals and report errors to the proper House for
                                   correction, etc.)
                              On motion of Mr. KIMBALL, the restrictions were suspended, and the
                                   bill was passed the House of Representatives without
                                   amendment--yeas, 68; nays, 7.
                         
                         
                              TEMPERANCE.
                              Mr. THAYER submitted a preamble and resolution reciting the vast
                                   importance of the subject of temperance; the fact that quite a
                                   number of bills on the subject have been introduced and are now
                                   in the hands of the Committee on Temperance;
                                   and the duty of members to examine them and consult their
                                   constituents with reference to their various provisions, and,
                                   therefore, making a formal order for printing 200 copies of said
                                   bills so introduced during this session; that the clerk see that
                                   this order is promptly executed, and cause two copies of each of
                                   said bills to be placed on the table of each member of the House
                                   of Representatives.
                              On the motion of Mr. WILSON of Ripley, it was laid on the
                                   table.
                         
                         
                              TEMPERANCE.
                              Mr. LENFESTY, by unanimous consent and by request of a German
                                   constituent (probably Mr Wolflin as the gentleman intimated),
                                   introduced a bill [H. R. 262] to regulate and license the sale of
                                   vinous and malt liquors, to prohibit the sale of a less quantity
                                   than five gallons at a time without first procuring a license as
                                   therein provided. The object (as he said) being to do away with
                                   whiskey as a beverage. There is a principle in it to which (being
                                   a prohibitionist) he did not subscribe, but he desired, that it
                                   might go to the Committee on Temperance that
                                   it might receive a just and proper consideration in our
                                   legislation on this subject.
                              It was read by the Clerk.
                              Mr. KIMBALL proposed to amend by striking out the words,
                                   "those who sell," wherever thev occur in the
                                   bill, and insert these words in lieu, "those who
                                   drink."
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley. I move to strike out "Tom
                                   Jefferson. [It occurs in the preamble.]
                              The SPEAKER. No motion except the motions to refer and to reject
                                   can be in order on the first reading; the preamble is considered
                                   last--with the title.
                              Mr. JOHNSON. There is quite a difference of sentiment about me here
                                   as to one section of the bill--whether it authorizes one person
                                   to drink five gallons at a time, or whether it is a prohibition
                                   of the sale of that quantity. [Laughter.]
                              Mr. LENFESTY. I am not the author of the bill. I have been
                                   requested to introduce it, and have taken the first opportunity
                                   of presenting it to the House. Its object is to do away with
                                   whiskey as a beverage--a deleterious beverage, and to substitute
                                   wine and beer, which latter it recognizes as harmless and
                                   healthy. I do not subscribe to the doctrine myself, but I desire,
                                   because there is a principle in it, that the bill should go to
                                   the Committee on Temperance.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. I hope it will be referred to the Republican
                                   caucus.
                              On his motion (by unanimous consent) the minority of the House on
                                   the passage of apportionment bill obtained leave to retire to the
                                   Library rooms for consultation.
                              The bill was referred to the Committee on
                                        Temperance.
                              The SPEAKER now took up and persued the call of Counties and
                                   Districts for--
                         
                         
                              NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                              Mr. ANDERSON introduced a bill [H. R. 263] for an act in relation
                                   to railroad fences and prescribing remedy for live stock killed
                                   or injured by railroads, and matters connected therewith. [All
                                   railroad fences declared to be division fences; all claims for
                                   railroad injuries to be filed with the County Clerk,and copy
                                   served on the company thirty days before suit is brought, and
                                   within sixty days time after the accident, etc.]
                              It was referred to the Committee on
                                   Railroads.
                              Mr. PRENTISS introduced a bill [H. R. 264] for an act to amend the

                              It was referred to the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary
                              Mr. CLARK introduced a bill [H. R. 265] for an act to define
                                   professional prostitution, and prescribing punishment
                                   therefor--prescribing rules of evidence in such cases, etc. [A
                                   female convicted thereof to be committed to the Reformatory for

                              It was referred to the Committee on the Reformatory

                              It was referred to the Committee on Roads and
                                        Highways.
                              Mr. TINGLEY presented the petition of sundry tax-payers of Rush
                                   county for the repeal of the county and township railroad aid act
                                   of 1869--calling particular attention to the hardship of the
                                   majority clause.
                              It was referred to the Committee on
                                   Railroads.
                              Mr. BAXTER presented petitions from citizens of Kosciusko and
                                   Wabash counties on the same subject. Also several petitions for a
                                   strong temperance law.
                              Mr. FURNAS and Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH also presented sundry temperance
                                   petitions.
                              All of which were referred under the rule.
                              Mr. JONES introduced a bill [H. R. 267] to amend the act to revise,
                                   simplify and abridge the rules of practice, etc., [with regard to

                              It was referred to the Committee on Rights and
                                        Privileges.
                              Mr. EDWARDS, of Lawrence, introduced a concurrent resolution
                                   condemning the proposed bill of Senator Sumner in relation to
                                   erasing the names of battles from the flags and the army
                                   register.
                              The SPEAKER. The same matter was disposed of the other day on the
                                   resolution of the gentleman from Marion [Mr. Kimball.]
                              Mr. Edwards withdrew the resolution.
                              Mr. THOMPSON, of Elkhart, by leave, returned from the
                                        Committee on Federal Relations, Mr.
                                   Heller's bill, [H. R. 286] providing for taking the
                                   sense of the qualified voters of the State on calling a
                                   convention to alter or amend the constitution of the State, with
                                   the recommendation that it pass.
                              On the motion of Mr. HELLER, the bill was laid on the table.
                         
                         
                              LEGISLATIVE APPORTIONMENT--PROTEST.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN asked and obtained leave to present the protest of
                                   those who voted against the bill [S. 146] for an act to fix the
                                   number of Senators and Representatives in the General Assembly of
                                   the of State of Indiana, and to apportion the same among the
                                   several counties, and giving their reasons therefor, which was
                                   read by the Clerk.
                              It is as follows:
                              Mr. SPEAKER: The undersigned who voted against
                                   the bill [S. 146] for an act to fix the number of Senators and
                                   Representatives in the General Assembly of the State of Indiana,
                                   and apportion the same among the several counties of the State
                                   and declaring an emergency, desire to protest against the passage
                                   of that bill and give their reasons therefor.
                              The object of all governments like ours, is to have the sovreignty
                                   which the General Assembly of the State are the agents by which
                                   that sovereignty manifests itself upon the Statute Book. The
                                   power itself resides in the people. That government is the most
                                   equal that brings this power into uniform action. When thus
                                   exercised, it is not only powerful but just. It places the
                                   Governor in his seat and gives him the executive authority. It
                                   makes the laws through its constituted agents, and gives them
                                   dicial animo. It places its broad seal upon the writ that brings
                                   the criminal to justice. It speaks from the jury box its verdict
                                   of weal or woe; and it directs the arm that executes the sentence
                                   of the law. A power thus omnipotent should be guarded with
                                   jealous care, and when robbed of its proper authority must
                                   produce disorder, weakness and confusion.
                              When the bill, mentioned in the beginning of this protest, came to
                                   the House from the other branch of the General Assembly, the
                                   undersigned hoped and believed that it would command here that
                                   careful consideration which its importance demanded. It proposed
                                   to distribute among the people that representation which the
                                   fundamental law declares "shall be apportioned among the
                                   several counties according to the number of white male
                                   inhabitants above twenty-one years of age." We demanded
                                   postponement and examination; it was refused. We asked for
                                   consideration and debate; it was denied.
                              In past general assemblies, when measures of this kind had been
                                   passed, the minority had resorted to revolution; but believing
                                   that wrong was little better than disorder, we determined to
                                   remain in our places in violation of well settled precedents, and
                                   rely upon the justice and magnanimity of the majority. We
                                   appealed to that justice and magnanimity in vain, thus justifying
                                   the revolutionary course of former legislatures; we appeal from
                                   the hasty and inconsiderate action of a party to the people
                                   themselves.
                              Upon an extended examination of the bill we find it carefully
                                   prepared to perpetuate the power of the Republican party. It
                                   strikes down thousands of voters in some of the counties, and
                                   places the power which justly belongs to them in the hands of
                                   their smaller neighbors, only because of their political
                                   sentiments. As instances of this, it gives to the counties of
                                   Floyd and Clark, with their voting population of 10,778, one
                                   Senator; and to their Republican neighbor, the county of
                                   Jefferson, a Senator for her vote of 5,405. It gives to the
                                   counties of Boone and Clinton, casting 10,117 votes, one Senator,
                                   and to the county of Randolph a Senator with a vote of 5,014; and
                                   this, as we believe, because of their political complexion. It
                                   gives to the county of Vermillion a representative for her 2,445
                                   votes, but denies one to the county of Bartholomew with her 4,761
                                   votes, and Vermillion is Republican while Bartholomew is
                                   Democratic. These are only a few of many instances of like
                                   irregularities; while the county of Marion, the center of
                                   political power and corruption, in effect, elects three Senators
                                   and five Representatives.
                              If anything were wanting to condemn the bill more than its manifest
                                   irregularities, it can be found in the fact that it was agreed
                                   upon in a party caucus and passed without debate in the General
                                   Assembly. We know that the political caucus is manipulated by
                                   outside influences not responsible to oaths or the people. The
                                   majority in this House, misled, as we believe, by designing men,
                                   not members on this floor, at the beginning of this session,
                                   resolved that all important measures should be determined in
                                   caucus and not considered and debated in this House. We believe
                                   that this was as wrong in principle as it is vicious in practice;
                                   and that the bill under consideration was the legitmate result of
                                   this departure from that correct principle of legislation. In our
                                   opinion the bill could never have passed this House except under
                                   the pressure of party discipline. We know that when that
                                   discipline is brought to bear the rights of the people are in
                                   jeopardy.
                              For these reasons, and in the name of that people whom we were sent
                                   here to represent, many of whom by the provisions of this bill
                                   will not hereafter be represented on this floor, we solesmly
                                   protest against  the action
                                   of this House in passing the law, and respectfully ask that this
                                   Protest be entered upon the journals of the House.

                              Mr. KIMBALL. There is one statement in that which is not entirely
                                   correct, and that is where they say debate was denied them. The
                                   bill was debated by the gentleman from Cass (Mr. Anderson), the
                                   gentleman from Bartholomew (Mr. Barrett) and the gentleman from
                                   Johnson (Mr. Woollen) himself; and the bill was recalled in order
                                   to give time for debate. And there is another incorrect
                                   statement, and that is where they intimate their belief that the
                                   Republican caucus way dictated to and controlled by outside
                                   influences. So far as the majority here have been concerned, that
                                   statement is entirely incorrect. I am willing to state here, that
                                   so far as my knowledge extends, there has been no outside
                                   influence brought to bear upon us.
                              Mr. BRETT (interposing). Did not the gentleman himself admit that
                                   outside influences were operating in the apportionment?
                              Mr. KIMBALL. No sir, I did not. And so far as the counties of
                                   Bartholomew and Brown are concerned, it was found that it
                                   required both of these counties to entitle them to one
                                   Representative, with a small overplus. And to rebut that
                                   inequality, Bartholomew and Brown being hardly entitled to one
                                   Senator, they were combined and given the two--one Representative
                                   and Senator. The majority took into consideration the surplusages
                                   on both sides, and found them about equal, and the inequalities
                                   were thus levelled down. As for the intimation that the city of
                                   Indianapolis is the center and seat of political corruption, I
                                   wall let that statement go for what it is worth. Mr. Speaker, I
                                   am satisfied with the protest.
                              Mr. BRETT. What about Mr. A. H. Conner's conduct?
                              Mr. KIMBALL. Mr. Conner is not under discussion, and I am sorry to
                                   see gentlemen of the opposition ready to name and characterize
                                   any gentleman, because it requires names to be called in the
                                   reply, and I will not do so. Mr. Speaker, I shall speak for
                                   myself--and I believe for the majority here--when I say, we are
                                   willing to stand by our action on the apportionments, and appeal
                                   to the people from that partizan protest. I believe I know the
                                   people. I believe they are honest--that they are capable of
                                   judging correctly as to what is right, and what is best for the
                                   State and for their respective localities, and I know, that I, in
                                   this matter, have represented the will of the people who sent me
                                   here. Mr. Speaker, I am glad that this protest has been returned
                                   in the gentlemanly language in which it has been read. I am glad
                                   they have had the manliness to withdraw and amend it. We fear
                                   nothing. We stand upon the rectitude of our action. We appeal to
                                   the people of Indiana, and trust in the people and in God for the
                                   justification of our cause, and we rest the case.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. The time is past for me to get excited. The
                                   gentleman's indignation comes to us in such good faith,
                                   that we are thrown back upon the conclusion that Marion county is
                                   entirely pure! He says he has been through the case, and so far
                                   as the Republican party is concerned it also is entirely pure.
                                   But we who live in the country have been observers as well as the
                                   gentleman, and we tell him we have seen too much to believe every
                                   word that is told us of the political purity about Indianapolis.
                                   The probability is--and it is the strongest probability--that
                                   there is truth in that protest, where it says: that Marion
                                   county--this political center--is the seat of power and
                                   corruption. I know that the gentleman from Marion has nothing to
                                   do with it, but there are others that are amenable to these words
                                   of the protest. I do not pretend to say that Democrats have not
                                   gone astray; but if they have gone astray, it is not due to their
                                   organization. With regard to the rest of that paper, I will tell
                                   the gentleman that it is just as we feel. I can have no doubt
                                   that the gentleman from Marion is wholly unconscious that he ever
                                   did a wrong thing in his life, and I suppose I do not do him
                                   justice in this, for l cannot make the declaration with such a
                                   rounded and benignant face as he did. Sir, that protest embodies
                                   what we think. But I want to say here, that when I speak of the
                                   acts of men of both political parties, I do not go down into a
                                   man's heart to see what he means, because we all, when
                                   we step into politics, are as apt to do wrong as right; but when
                                   we go out otherwise than in politics, we are about as other men.
                                   Now, I believe it is true that there never was a political caucus
                                   called together in
                                   Indianapolis that was not affected more or less by outside
                                   influences. Hence the reason of the statement in the protest.
                                   When we have the decree of a legislative caucus, that is but one
                                   side of the case, and it is necessary for a correct judgment to
                                   hear both sides of the case. If you drop into a court room
                                   to-morrow and hear one of the attorneys in any case, you go out
                                   with the impression that his cause is right. But if you had
                                   remained and heard the answer, and the siftings and reasonings in
                                   the case, you would say there was another side to it. And herein
                                   is the danger in all political caucuses. I believe I can sit on
                                   the fence and do justice between man and man, and yet I would be
                                   afraid to trust myself if I heard but one side of the case. There
                                   is nothing that contributes so much to a fair judgment as the
                                   discussion of both sides. Your Supreme Court demands that they
                                   shall hear the reasonings--the pleadings on both sides. It is
                                   when mind strikes mind that you have the light. And I believe
                                   this doctrine is as sound in thelegislative hall as it is on the
                                   bench. I believe we ought to come by our conclusions here just as
                                   the judge makes up his mind sitting upon the bench If we would do
                                   that, sir; if we would be constantly governed by this rule here,
                                   I tell you that the laws emanating from these halls would be so
                                   just and right and righteous that the people would commend us,
                                   and we would be blessed in our designs.
                              Mr. WALKER. I believe the testimony is all in, and I think it is
                                   time for the court to charge the jury.
                              The SPEAKER. The protest will go to the journal.
                              Mr. CAUTHORN. I do not desire to disturb things where so much oil
                                   has been thrown on the troubled waters. We all know that Marion
                                   county is to the State what the heart is to the human system All
                                   the people are continually crowding into and flowing out of this
                                   center of trade manufactures, and all the interests of profession
                                   and craft--and wherever there are crowded interests and men there
                                   is corruption. And when we say this in the protest, we do not
                                   charge that all are corrupt--but Indianapolis being the capitol
                                   of the State, it is the seat of fraud and corruption.
                              Mr. COWGILL interposed a few words, which were not heard.
                              Mr. BRANHAM. Mr. Speaker, I thought the argument in this case was
                                   closed. [Laughter.]
                         
                         
                              HUMOROUS--WHIMSICAL--GENERAL.
                              Mr. ------------- submitted a resolution for an order that if any
                                   page be found guilty of writing or scribbling on any paper, book
                                   or document about the desks of this Hall, he shall be deemed
                                   guilty of a misdemeanor and discharged from the employment of the
                                   House.
                              On the motion of Mr. SHUTT, it was laid on the table.
                              Mr. WILSON, of Ripley, submitted the following:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             RESOLVED, That the minority and
                                                  the majority in this House now shake hands over
                                                  the bloody chasm.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              Mr. CAUTHORN. In order to carry out the resolution, I move that we
                                   have a recess. ["Consent,"
                                   "consent."]
                              The SPEAKER. By unanimous consent, the House is resolved into
                                        Committee of the Whole--the gentleman
                                   from Knox (Mr. Cauthorn) in the chair, [Laughter.]
                              The CHAIRMAN. The House is still in session--as in
                                        Committee of the Whole House.
                                   [Laughter.]
                              The House being thus prepared in the later hours of the night and
                                   waiting for the consideration of the Senate amendments to the
                                   specific bill [H. R. 259] relaxed into the consideration of
                                   things humorous, whimsical and general, with a mock parliamentary
                                   treatment, of which the following is a sufficiently careful
                                   summary:
                              Mr. ------------- submitted a resolution for a select committee to
                                   extract the panes from the windows of the rotunda.
                              The CHAIRMAN, The question is on the adoption of the
                                   resolution.
                              Mr. FURNAS. I do not want the committee to go into this thing
                                   blindly. I want to know whether there is any story?
                              The CHAIRMAN. There is no story in it.
                              Mr. GIFFORD. I would inquire of the gentleman whether he has
                                   himself drawn any ex-stories?
                              The CHAIRMAN. The chair can answer only as to itself. I have not
                                   drawn any green backs.
                              Mr. WILSON. Is there anything before the committee?
                              The CHAIRMAN. Nothing but the gentleman from Ripley.
                              Sundry resolutions were offered and variously disposed of,
                                   including one requiring the Committee on
                                        Temperance to stand treat; another in favor of
                                   shaking hands across the bloody chasm; another declaring the
                                   gentleman from Marion (Mr. Kimball) and the gentleman from
                                   Johnson (Mr. Woollen) guilty of contempt in smoking in the lobby,
                                   unless they furnish all members of the Committee with cigars.
                              
                              Business growing slack, Mr. WOLFLIN was called upon for a speech,
                                   and responded in German, with great cheerfulness and eclat.
                              Mr. KIMBALL moved that Mr. Joseph Lawson be invited to give a
                                   recitation from Richard III. The motion was agreed to. and Mr.
                                   Lawson recited, "now is the winter of our
                                   discontent," etc. The hat was then passed, and a liberal
                                   collection gathered.
                              Other sundry resolutions were "offered" and
                                   "taken by consent" requesting the gentleman
                                   from Vanderburg (Mr. Wolflin, the reputed author of the five

                                   (Mr. Edwards) inform the House what he knows about courtship and
                                   marriage in general; that the committee be instructed to report
                                   such legislation as may be necessary to promote the emigration of
                                   insurance solicitors and the spontaneous growth of sewing machine

                              Mr. JOHNSON. Resolved, That this committee proceed to do some thing
                                   ridiculous.
                              Mr. MILLER. I then call for a speech from the gentleman from
                                   Marion.
                         
                         
                              SPECIFIC APPROPRIATIONS.
                              At eleven o'clock a. message was received from the Senate,
                                   announcing the passage of the Specific Appropriation Bill [H. R.

                              Mr. BRANHAM. If any of this work has been improperly done we can
                                   revise and correct it at the next session. I move that the House
                                   concur in all the amendments.
                              The motion was agreed to, and the amendments were concurred in
                                   without a division.

                                   Senate.
                         
                         
                              SENATE FURNITURE.
                              Mr. CAVE offered a resolution that the doorkeeper make a detailed
                                   report of all furniture furnished for the Senate Chamber and the
                                   committee rooms, the amount of rent paid for rooms, the number
                                   rented, etc.
                              It was adopted.
                         
                         
                              VENTILATION.
                              Mr. SCOTT, from the Special Committee on
                                        Ventilation, made a verbal report in which he
                                   said: The stoves should be put in front and rear, and strong
                                   doors, nearly like these baize doors, would keep out the cold
                                   air; and we recommend that these doors be placed there by the
                                   Librarian during the recess.
                              Subsequently, Mr. SCOTT moved that the Librarian make the
                                   improvements the Committee on Ventilation
                                   recommended.
                              It was agreed to.
                         
                         
                              NEW STATE HOUSE.
                              Mr. SCOTT moved to reconsider the vote of Iast night, by which the
                                   joint resolution in relation to premiums for the new State House,
                                   and authorizing the special committee to visit the capitals of adjoining States, was
                                   lost.
                              Mr. ROSEBRUGH said he was as much in favor of embellishment and
                                   ornamentation as anybody, and was in favor of a new State House
                                   when the people were able to pay for it. But he did not believe
                                   his people were able to stand the expense, and thought the
                                   Assembly could get along for a while yet with the present
                                   one.
                              Mr. HALL said he was in favor of a new State House and a good one,
                                   but he did not believe the visiting of State Houses in the
                                   adjacent States would be of any advantage. He therefore moved to
                                   strike out the latter part of the resolution.
                              Mr. SCOTT said he had no personal interest in the matter, but
                                   something must be done. This building will not last much longer
                                   without tumbling down. Even if we decide to build a new State
                                   House itwill be several years before it can be occupied, and the
                                   present building is crumbling fast. One tenth of the members are
                                   gone all the time from diseases contracted in this old tumble
                                   down, and something must be done.
                              Mr. O'BRIEN did not believe the resolution would effect
                                   anything. He said $1,000 would not pay an architect for the labor
                                   required in preparing plans for a building of such magnitude as
                                   this, and he did not believe in paying a committee $20,000 to go
                                   junketing around the country. He therefore moved that the whole
                                   subject lie on the table, which prevailed.
                              Mr. DITTEMORE moved that each Senator be allowed $30 additional
                                   worth of stationery and stamps.
                              The motion was rejected.
                              An adjournment was made till to-morrow (Sunday) at ten
                                   o'clock a. m.
                         
                    
                    
                    
                         THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                         
                         THIRTEENTH VOLUME.
                         
                         INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
                         
                         HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                         
                              SATURDAY, December 21, 1872.
                         
                         The House met at ten o'clock, a. m., and the reading of the
                              Journal of yesterday was dispensed with.
                         
                              THE SPEAKER.
                              Mr. OFFUTT, (Mr. Cauthorn being in the chair,) submitted a
                                   resolution of thanks to the Honorable William K. Edwards for the
                                   able and efficient manner in which he has discharged the duties
                                   of Speaker during this session, and that in his retirement from
                                   that position at the close of the session, he carries with him
                                   the best wishes of every member of the House of Representatives
                                   for his personal prosperity. He said: I am sure the House will
                                   concur with me in what the resolution expresses, and I think it
                                   would be well to pass it by yeas and nays.
                              Mr. RUMSEY. I know it is unanimous--the yeas and nays would be a
                                   useless formality.
                              On the motion of Mr. KIMBALL the resolution was adopted by the
                                   rising vote unanimously.
                         
                         
                              JUDICIAL APPORTIONMENT.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. There was a concurrent resolution offered by me some
                                   time ago to make a trial to equalize the judicial apportionment
                                   of the State. It was lost when we wanted it yesterday, but I
                                   understand from the Clerk that it has been recovered. If the
                                   House consent, I would like to have the resolution taken up.
                              There being no objection, it was read by the Clerk.
                              It proposes the appointment of a joint Select Committee of nine
                                   members of the General Assembly--six on the part of the House of
                                   Representatives, and three on the part of the Senate--distributed
                                   equally as near as possible throughout the different counties of
                                   the State, whose duty it shall be to apportion and equalize as
                                   near as may be, the several Judicial Districts and Circuits, the
                                   Circuits to be formed on a basis of not less than 60,000
                                   inhabitants--the time of the Judges in the Courts to be at least
                                   forty weeks in each year. Said Circuits to be made with respect
                                   to the present residence of the Judges; the committee to sit
                                   during the vacation between this and the regular session, and
                                   that each member thereof be allowed five dollars per day.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. I felt before I came here, and I believe it is the
                                   unanimous feeling of the people, that something ought to be done
                                   by the Legislature to equalize the labor of the judges with a
                                   view to raising their compensation. I do not know that it would
                                   require an increase of the number of the judges. And there is
                                   another thing--as little expense as possible should be charged to
                                   the State till we shall see whether anything can be accomplished.
                                   I would like to have the opinion of the House. My idea was this:
                                   that this committee should address letters to the judges, asking
                                   them to meet the committee in this city on a certain day before
                                   the regular session, and talk with them of the expediency and possibilities of
                                   rearranging the circuits and districts. The judges might come by
                                   the first of January and sit till the next session. I would like
                                   to have the opinion of the House as to what good can come out of
                                   the proposed committee.
                              Mr. GIVAN. I heartily concur in the object of the resolution. We
                                   have probably the most expensive and abominable judicial
                                   apportionment and judicial system that can be conceived. As to
                                   the basis of 60,000, it is too large.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. I propose no rule. I put that in as a basis. The
                                   committee would not be compelled to follow it.
                              Mr. GIVAN. That ratio would make the circuits too large, especially
                                   if we abolish the Common Pleas. [Mr. Woollen, in his seat: That
                                   will not be done.] The object being two-fold--to equalize the
                                   labor and to increase the compensation of the judges. I do not
                                   know any better way to proceed than that in the resolution. The
                                   proposition should certainly be before us in the early part of
                                   the regular session.
                              Mr. MELLETT. As to whether this is the proper time to consider this
                                   subject, I do not know. I think I know one thing, and that is,
                                   the time of members has been pretty well occupied during the
                                   present session. As to the necessity for the work of the Courts
                                   being done promptly, there can be no doubt. There is no question
                                   about the fact, that we have more Circuits than we need; and that
                                   they are unequally distributed if we have the proper number.
                                   During the past few years a great many new Circuits and Districts
                                   have been formed simply by cutting one in two. I have known a
                                   great many instances of that kind, and that shows upon its face
                                   that we are making districts smaller than they should be: one
                                   Judge has had too much work, and by making two circuits for his
                                   relief the circuits have been made too small, and that is the
                                   only way it could be done without redistricting the State. I
                                   think the fewer circuits and Judges, the more hard the work, the
                                   better Judges we will have on the bench. If the Judge's
                                   time is all occupied, as much as his strength will bear, his
                                   entire attention is rivetted upon the one subject of his calling,
                                   whilst, if he occupy but half his time on the bench, for the
                                   other half he is occupied with things outside of his profession;
                                   but if he were engaged all the time holding Court, he would be
                                   occupied with his profession and constantly improving himself
                                   therein. Judge Bicknell, for example, has eight counties, and he
                                   probably does more work than any one Judge in the State, for the
                                   reason that his entire time is devoted. He has reduced his
                                   profession to a science; and I will guarantee that you have
                                   better work in his circuit than in any other circuit in the
                                   State. Then there are other Judges who don't do half the
                                   work, but they all draw the same pay. If we raise the salary it
                                   is absolutely necessary that we reduce the number of Judges. This
                                   proposition, I believe, will work a great saving to the taxpayer,
                                   and bring our practice into better repute. And, if it should be
                                   deemed necessary that this committee should be appointed now, I
                                   am in favor of the resolution.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY. I do not wish to discuss the merits of the resolution.
                                   I am in favor of it, and I simply rise to offer an amendment by
                                   proposing a clause "to instruct the committee to invite,
                                   by notice in the Journal and Sentinel, the Judges of the District and Circuit
                                   Courts to meet in this city with the committee and give them the
                                   benefit of their advice."
                              Mr. MILLER. I am decidedly in favor of the object sought to be
                                   accomplished, but I very much question whether we are beginning
                                   in the right way. There is universal complaint that our judicial
                                   system is not what it should be. My idea is that we had better
                                   first determine what kind of a system we will have. There is a
                                   proposition to dispense with the Common Pleas; and it is perhaps
                                   only in this way that we will be able to establish a proper
                                   system. As it is, the terms of the Common Pleas ought to be held
                                   between the terms of the Circuit Courts, to accommodate appeals;
                                   and it will become a grave question whether the one or the other
                                   court shall give way. My idea would be first to establish these
                                   points, whether we are going to have a Common Pleas and Probate
                                   in each county, or whether we are going to have an undivided
                                   court; and in either case it would involve a redistricting of the
                                   State. But if we abolish the Common Pleas, then there would be no
                                   necessity for a redistricting. I am opposed to the appointment of
                                   this committee, simply because it will result in continuing our
                                   present pernicious system.
                              Mr. SATTERWHITE. Would it be possible for this committee to
                                   legislate any judge out of office?
                              The SPEAKER. No, they could not do that.
                              Mr. MELLETT. We can't reduce their number, but we might
                                   reduce their time. But if we could reduce their number we would
                                   have a better system of justice. I should like to vote for a bill
                                   to raise the salaries of judges like Judge Bicknell, but not of those who devote
                                   half their time to farming or fishing.
                              Mr. GIVAN. I think it would be a good thing for some of the judges
                                   to lay idle more than they do. My idea is that you would do
                                   better to abolish the Common Pleas and have a Surrogate system,
                                   so that the judges may be occupied all their time in the larger
                                   counties and the adjoining smaller counties in the same district.
                                   It seems to me that would be much cheaper. The expensiveness of
                                   our system is not so much in the salary of the judges as in the
                                   expenses of the litigants by frequent attendance and delays.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. The resolution does not contemplate legislating the
                                   judges out, but to equalize the labor amongst them. Our
                                   proposition here is to pay the Common Pleas judges out of the
                                   State Treasury, and so long as that is done it is absolutely
                                   necessary that the labor should be equalized.
                              The resolution was adopted on the part of the House of
                                   Representatives.
                         
                         
                              THE ADJOURNMENT SINE DIE.
                              Mr. TULLY submitted a concurrent resolution (which was adopted on
                                   the part of the House of Representatives), that this session of
                                   the General Assembly shall be adjourned to-morrow (Sunday)
                                   morning at ten o'clock.
                              Mr. LENFESTY submitted a resolution for the tender of the thanks of
                                   the House of Representatives to officers, reporters and employes
                                   for their promptness and efficiency, adding good wishes, which
                                   was adopted without dissent.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY and Mr. FURNAS had drawn, and were ready to offer,
                                   similar resolutions.
                              Mr. PFRIMMER submitted the following:
                              
                                   
                                        
                                             WHEREAS, capital punishment is
                                                  abhorred by the intelligence of the age, and
                                                  forbidden by every noble impulse of the human
                                                  heart, therefore--
                                             RESOLVED, by the General
                                                  Assembly, that the Governor be requested to
                                                  commute, with imprisonment for life, the
                                                  punishment of every person now under sentence of
                                                  death in the State of Indiana.
                                        
                                   
                              
                              On the motion of Mr. MILLER, it was laid on the table.
                              Mr. SHIRLEY seeing that nothing more is likely to be proposed or
                                   called up, moved that the House adjourn till two
                                   o'clock, and that members living at a distance who
                                   desire to return home by the afternoon trains be allowed to do
                                   so.
                              The SPEAKER. The Governor will have a communication for the House
                                   this afternoon.
                              The motion was adopted by unanimous consent.
                              The House then took a recess till two o'clock p. m.
                         
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              The SPEAKER resumed the chair at two o'clock p. m.
                              A message from the Senate announced the recession of that body from
                                   their disagreement to the House amendments to the Public
                                   Buildings bill.
                         
                         
                              JUDICIAL APPORTIONMENT.
                              On motion of Mr. WOOLLEN, his concurrent resolution for a joint
                                   select committee to rearrange the judicial districts was taken up
                                   by unanimous consent, as by reconsideration of the vote on its
                                   adoption by the House of Representatives, and he moved to amend
                                   it by striking out the words which make it a concurred
                                   resolution.
                              The SPEAKER. It provides for six members of the committee on the
                                   part of the House--how many will the gentleman have?
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. Nine members of the House appointed by the
                                   Speaker.
                              The amendment was agreed to making it an order of the House of
                                   Representatives.
                              And so the resolution was adopted.
                              A message was received from the Governor by the hand of Captain
                                   John M. Commons, his private Secretary, with information that His
                                   Excellency had approved, signed and filed in the office of the
                                   Secretary of State, sundry acts and joint resolutions originating
                                   in the House of Representatives.
                              A message from the Senate informed the House of Representatives
                                   that that body has concurred in the House concurrent resolution
                                   to adjourn sine die to-morrow at ten o'clock, a. m.,
                                   with an amendment to read: "12 o'clock,
                                   midnight." Also, that that body has passed a concurrent
                                   resolution for a joint select committee of nine for
                                   re-arrangement of the judicial districts and circuits of the
                                   State, and report a bill for that purpose to the two Houses of
                                   the General Assembly at the next session. [It is identical with
                                   Mr. Woollen's.]
                              The Senate judicial concurrent resolution was taken up and adopted
                                   without a division.
                              Mr. WOOLLEN. As my resolution is now superseded by this action of
                                   the House I suppose it would be proper to ask that the action
                                   just taken on my resolution be omitted in the journal.
                              The SPEAKER. It will be so ordered by consent.
                         
                         
                         
                              STATE'S PROPERTY.
                              Mr. KIMBALL submitted a resolution for an order (which was adopted)
                                   that the door-keeper be directed to take charge of the property
                                   belonging to the State in the different committee rooms of the
                                   House, so that the same shall not be lost to the State.
                         
                         
                              SUNDAY SESSION.
                              Mr. KIMBALL submitted a motion (which was adopted) that when the
                                   House shall adjourn, to-day, it shall be till ten
                                   o'clock tomorrow morning: whereupon Messrs. Johnson and
                                   Edwards, of Lawrence, were appointed a special committee to
                                   secure the attendance of a minister of the gospel to open the
                                   sessions with prayers.
                         
                         
                              ASSESSMENT ACT.
                              A message from the Senate announced a concurrent resolution of that
                                   body directing the Secretary of State to cause to be printed
                                   1,000 copies of the Assessment act in pamphlet form, and that six
                                   copies thereof be transmitted, without delay, to each of the
                                   County Auditors in the State for the use of county officers.
                              The resolution communicated with the foregoing message was taken up
                                   and concurred in on the part of the House of Representatives.
                              The House then adjourned till to-morrow (Sunday) at ten
                                   o'clock a. m.

                         IN SENATE.
                         
                              SUNDAY, December 22, 1872.
                         
                         Senators met at ten o'clock a. m. pursuant to adjournment.
                         The PRESIDENT of the Senate announced the first thing in order to be the
                              reading of the Journal of yesterday's proceedings.
                         On motion it was dispensed with.
                         Mr. DAGGY moved that a committee of three be appointed to wait on the
                              Governor and ascertain whether he has any further communications to
                              make to the General Assembly.
                         The motion was agreed to, and Messrs. Daggy, Dittemore and Beardsley
                              were appointed.
                         Soon thereafter--
                         Mr. DAGGY, in behalf of the committee, reported that the Governor has no
                              further communication to make to this session of the General
                              Assembly.
                         Mr. BEARDSLEY moved to adjourn.
                         The motion was agreed to, with the understanding that the adjournment
                              was only till two o'clock p. m.
                         
                              AFTERNOON SESSION.
                              Senators met at two o'clock.
                              Mr. DAGGY moved that the Secretary be sent to the House of
                                   Representatives to inquire whether it has any further messages

                              Mr. BROWN moved that the Senate adjourn, whereupon President
                                   FRIEDLEY spoke as follows:
                         
                         
                              THE PRESIDENT'S FAREWELL ADDRESS.
                              GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE
                                   :
                              Before putting the motion I desire to say a single word. I have no
                                   language adequate to express the gratitude I feel toward you for
                                   your kindness during the session just closed, and especially for
                                   the very complimentary manner in which you saw proper to mention
                                   my name in the resolution adopted yesterday. When, by your
                                   kindness, I was, at the beginning of the session, selected as
                                   your presiding officer, I was wholly without experience, and if I
                                   have been, in any degree, successful in the discharge of the
                                   duties of the position, I must attribute that success to your
                                   constant assistance. That I have made mistakes I freely admit,
                                   but I beg Senators to believe that they have been mistakes of the
                                   head and not of the heart. My relations, both personal and
                                   official, have been of the most agreeable character with every
                                   Senator on this floor, and the friendship that we have formed,
                                   while here, will always be cherished by me with feelings of the
                                   most lively satisfaction. And now that we are about to separate
                                   to enjoy the Christmas of 1872 and the New Year of 1873, with our
                                   families and friends at home, I beg to express the wish that that
                                   Christmas may be a merry one and that New Year a happy one with
                                   each of you. May sorrow and sadness never cast their dark shadow
                                   over your homes. I thank you. [Applause.]
                              It is moved and seconded that the Senate do now adjourn. As many as
                                   favor that motion will please say "aye." [After
                                   the affirmative response.] As many as are of a contrary opinion
                                   say "no." [There was no response.] The Senate
                                   stands adjourned.
                              And so terminated the Senate proceedings at the Special Session of
                                   1872.

                              SUNDAY, December 22, 1872.
                         
                         The House met at ten o'clock, a. m.
                         The SPEAKER. The Clerk will read the journal of yesterday.
                         On the motion of Mr. JOHNSON, the reading was dispensed with.
                         
                              THE PRAYERS.
                              The SPEAKER. Prayer will now be offered by the Rev. Mr. Green, of
                                   this city.
                              Rev. Mr. GREEN: Let us pray. Almighty and Eternal God, Thou art our
                                   Father and Creator. Thou art the Author and Preserver of our
                                   being, and in Thee we live and move and have our being. Thou hast
                                   made it our duty and our privilege to supplicate Thy throne of
                                   favor, praying to Thee day and night for the things we need,
                                   acknowledging the hand of Thy Providence, and asking for Thy
                                   blessing in all our doings. We pray Thee to meet us in Thy
                                   mercies this morning. Grant that Thy blessing may rest on the
                                   members of this Legislature who are to-day bringing the labors of
                                   their session to a close. We thank Thee for the favor that has
                                   attended them and rested on their proceedings in the past, and
                                   we pray that all that has been wise and just and true in their
                                   transactions here may promote the interests of those they
                                   represent, and result in Thy glory and the prosperity of this
                                   commonwealth. Let Thy blessing attend them to-day. Grant that in
                                   their proceedings this day Thy presence may be felt. Since it has
                                   been determined that this ses on shall terminate on this day--the
                                   day that the Lord hath made a Sabbath--grant that the spirit of
                                   the Sabbath may be with them, and that the spirit of peace and
                                   good will may rest upon them. Be with them in their departure
                                   hence. Conduct them to their homes in safety, and bless them in
                                   all their varied circumstances and conditions in this life, and
                                   at last, in the great and final day, when Thou shalt gather all
                                   the nations to be judged according to the deeds done in the body,
                                   may they all be found justified in Christ--sanctified by His
                                   Spirit and justified by His blood--and be with Him in that
                                   blissful state beyond forever more. All of which we ask in the
                                   name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen.
                              The SPEAKER. I learn that the Senate has adjourned till two
                                   o'clock. There is no law to prescribe the time of day
                                   for the adjournment, but it will be safe to await the action of
                                   the Senate.
                              On the motion of Mr. COBB, the House took a recess till two
                                   o'clock, p. m.

                              CLOSING COMPELLATIONS.
                              A message was received from the Senate to notify the House of
                                   Representatives that the Senate has no further communication to
                                   report, and inquiring whether the House has any further business
                                   to communicate during the present session.
                              Mr. COBB submitted a resolution for an order (which was adopted) to
                                   inform the  Senate that the
                                   House has no further business to communicate.
                              Mr. THOMPSON, of Elkhart, submitted a resolution for an order
                                   (which was adopted) that a committee of three be appointed to
                                   wait upon His Excellency the Governor and inquire whether he has
                                   any further communication to make to the House during the present
                                   session.
                              The SPEAKER made said committee to consist of Messrs. Thompson of
                                   Elkhart, Cobb and McConnell.
                              A later message from the Senate, by their Secretary, informing the
                                   House that the Senate will immediately repair to the House of
                                   Representatives to witness the closing ceremonies of the session,
                                   and respectfully requesting the House of Representatives to
                                   repair to the Senate for the same purpose, was also received and
                                   read by the messenger.
                              Mr. THOMPSON, of Elkhart, from the Special Committe to wait on the
                                   Governor, etc., reported the discharge of that duty, and that the
                                   Governor returned for answer, that he has no further
                                   communication.
                              Mr. COBB moved that the House do now adjourn sine die; whereupon
                                   the SPEAKER said:
                         
                         
                              GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF
                                        REPRESENTATIVES:
                              The diligent attention you have bestowed to consider and mature the
                                   proceedings of this session is marked by legislative ability and
                                   fidelity to the interests of those whose confidence you
                                   represent.

                    TRANSMITTED TO THE SPECIAL SESSION, NOVEMBER 14,

                                   MESSAGE.
                                   Gentlemen of the Senate and House of
                                        Representatives:
                                   The growth of the State in population and wealth, and the
                                        consequent increased diversity and importance of the
                                        subjects and interests requiring legislative supervision and
                                        protection, render it impracticable for the General Assembly
                                        to transact all the business demanding its attention during
                                        its regular biennial sessions (limited as these are by the
                                        Constitution to the term of sixty-one days each), even when
                                        nothing extraordinary occurs to impede and prevent
                                        legislation. When, however, to these considerations the fact
                                        is added, that the last three sessions were all prematurely
                                        and abruptly terminated by the resignation of members, and
                                        by reason thereof much important and necessary legislation
                                        failed to be enacted, no other reason need be offered in
                                        explanation of the exercise of the Constitutional power of
                                        calling you together at this time in special session.
                                   
                                        COMPLETION OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS OF ONE
                                             SESSION BY ANOTHER.
                                        The act of March 4, 1865, entitled "An act
                                             providing for the completion of the unfinished business
                                             of any session of the General Assembly by the next
                                             succeeding special session of the same General
                                             Assembly," ought to be promptly amended. As it
                                             now stands, the unfinished business of any regular or
                                             special session which is succeeded by a special session
                                             of the same General Assembly may be taken up and
                                             completed by such special session; but, when a special
                                             session is succeeded by a regular session of the same
                                             General Assembly,
                                             there is no provision that the latter may take up and
                                             complete the business of the former. This amendment is
                                             necessary to enable you at your approaching regular
                                             session to complete the business which may be left in
                                             an unfinished condition at the close of the present
                                             special session.
                                   
                                   
                                        THE GARRETT SUIT AGAINST THE WABASH AND
                                             ERIE CANAL.
                                        Those of you who were members of the last General
                                             Assembly will remember that in my regular message,
                                             delivered at the commencement of that session, I called
                                             especial attention to the fact that a suit had been
                                             commenced in the Circuit Court of Carroll county, by
                                             John W. Garrett, Esq., to enforce against the Wabash
                                             and Erie Canal an alleged lien, created by the State
                                             prior to 1841, and held by Garrett and others, for
                                             whose benefit the suit is brought.
                                        The State, between the years 1834 and 1841, issued a
                                             large number of bonds for internal improvement
                                             purposes. One hundred and ninety-one of these bonds, or
                                             thereabouts, of $1,000 each, exclusive of interest, are
                                             still outstanding, the rest having been surrendered
                                             under the legislation of 1846 and 1847, commonly called
                                             the "Butler Bill."
                                        Mr. Garrett assumes to be, and I suppose is, the holder
                                             of forty-one of these one hundred and ninety-one old
                                             bonds, and he sues for himself as well as for the
                                             holders of the residue, to enforce a lien on the Canal
                                             and its revenues, which, it is alleged, was created by
                                             the legislation under which the bonds were issued.
                                        Hon. Horace P. Biddle, Judge of the Court, on the hearing
                                             of a demurrer in the cause, decided that the bonds were
                                             a lien on the Canal paramount to the title of the
                                             Trustees, derived from the State in 1847 under the
                                             "Butler Bill," and I am fully
                                             satisfied that the decision was a correct one.
                                             Garrett's action has been removed by a change of venue from the Circuit
                                             Court of Carroll county to the Circuit Court of Cass
                                             county, where it is now pending. The term of the Cass
                                             Circuit Court commenced two days ago, viz., on the 11th
                                             instant, and a judgment may be rendered in a very short
                                             time, subjecting the Canal or its revenues to the
                                             satisfaction of the claim. The State is not a party to
                                             the suit and can not, therefore, exercise the right of
                                             appeal, nor can she, under existing legislation, insist
                                             that the Trustees shall appeal if they do not desire to
                                             do so; and if even the Trustees should desire to
                                             appeal, they might not be able to stay the execution of
                                             the judgment by giving the necessary appeal bond and security in the
                                             absence of any provision by the State for indemnifying
                                             the sureties in the appeal bond. Under these
                                             circumstances, it is of the highest moment that the
                                             subject should receive immediate consideration by
                                             you.
                                        I quote from my last regular message the following
                                             extracts as expressive of my present views on the
                                             subject:
                                        "If these bonds are a lien on the Wabash and
                                             Erie Canal, as I believe them to be, the State can not
                                             afford to permit the title of the Trutsees to be
                                             divested or their possession and control of the Canal
                                             and its revenues to be interrupted by the judicial
                                             enforcement of said lien. To prevent this, provision
                                             should be made to pay out of the Treasury of the State
                                             such of said one hundred and ninety-one bonds as may be
                                             adjudged to be a lien on the Canal and its revenues
                                             whenever it may become necessary to make such payment
                                             in order to prevent the Canal or its revenues from
                                             being subjected to the satisfaction of the lien.
                                             Indeed, independently of this lien altogether, I do not
                                             see how the State can honorably refuse to redeem these
                                             few outstanding Internal Improvement Bonds. They were
                                             issued by the State, and the faith of the State was
                                             pledged for their redemption, and this pledge can not
                                             be disregarded or set aside without the consent of both
                                             parties to the contract, if the State has the ability
                                             to redeem the pledge, of which there can be no doubt.
                                             If the holders of the bonds had surrendered them under
                                             the Butler Bill, as other holders surrendered theirs,
                                             and agreed to look exclusively to the revenues of the
                                             Canal for one-half of their debt, this would have been
                                             a new contract, and the State could not be justly
                                             complained of for insisting on its execution. But the
                                             holders of the bonds now under consideration have
                                             continuously refused to surrender them under the
                                             adjustment proposed by the Butler Bill, and the State
                                             can not compel them to do so, nor can she refuse to pay
                                             them without repudiating her plighted faith.
                                        "If the State should stand by and permit the
                                             Canal or its revenues to be wrested from the hands of
                                             the Canal Trustees, to satisfy a paramount lien created
                                             by the State itself prior to the conveyance of the
                                             Canal to said Trustees, then, indeed, might the holders
                                             of the Canal stocks, with some show of reason, claim
                                             that the State should redeem the many millions of
                                             dollars of Canal stocks which, under the existing
                                             arrangement, are exclusively charged upon the Canal and
                                             for which the State is in no way bound.
                                        "I hope that you will promptly adopt such
                                             measures as will forever prevent the possibility of the
                                             trust being disturbed or impaired by  the enforcement of this
                                             lien. It is both right and expedient that the State
                                             should thus protect the trust property, and I also
                                             recommend that the State relieve the Board of Canal
                                             Trustees from all the expenses of the litigation to
                                             which they have been or may be subjected to in
                                             defending the trust property from the attempt made to
                                             subject it to the satisfaction of said lien.
                                        "Sixty-nine of these one hundred and ninety-one
                                             old bonds are held by the Interior Department of the
                                             General Government, and I herewith respectfully submit
                                             to you a copy of an official communication written to
                                             me under date March 25, 1872, by Hon. Columbus Delano,
                                             Secretary of that Department, in relation to the unpaid
                                             interest due on the sixty-nine bonds last
                                             mentioned.
                                   
                                   
                                        CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IN RELATION TO
                                             CANAL DEBT.
                                        The last General Assembly passed a joint resolution
                                             proposing an amendment to the Constitution of this
                                             State in relation to the debt charged upon the Wabash
                                             and Erie Canal under the adjustment made by the State
                                             with her creditors in 1847.
                                        The proposed amendment provides that no law or resolution
                                             shall ever be passed by the General Assembly of the
                                             State of Indiana that shall recognize any liability of
                                             the State to pay or redeem any certificate of stock
                                             issued in pursuance of "An act to provide for
                                             the funded debt of the State of Indiana, and for the
                                             completion of the Wabash and Erie Canal to
                                             Evansville," passed January 19th, 1846, and an
                                             act supplemental to said act, passed January 29th,
                                             1847, which, by the provisions of the said acts, or
                                             either of them, shall be payable exclusively from the
                                             proceeds of the Canal lands, and the tolls and revenues
                                             of the Canal in said acts mentioned, and no such
                                             certificate of stocks shall ever be paid by this State.
                                             I earnestly recommend that the amendment, the substance
                                             of which I have just stated be promptly agreed to and
                                             adopted by the present General Assembly at this
                                             session, and that provision be made by law for its
                                             speedy submission to the people for ratification.
                                             Having heretofore so fully discussed the questions
                                             involved in the proposed amendment, I do not deem it
                                             expedient or necessary now to reiterate my opinions or
                                             the arguments urged in support of them, but content
                                             myself by saying, that the views expressed in my last
                                             regular message on the subject of the Canal debt, and
                                             the necessity and propriety of such an amendment to the
                                             Constitution, remain unchanged. To the end that these
                                             views may be conveniently accessible to all of you, I will cause a
                                             pamphlet copy of the message alluded to, to be
                                             addressed and delivered to every member of this General
                                             Assembly. The fact was brought to my notice some time
                                             since that the printed journals of the Senate and House
                                             of Representatives of the last General Assembly do not
                                             show that the proposed amendment, with the yeas and
                                             nays thereon, was entered on the Journal of either
                                             House, and consequently, doubt has been expressed as to
                                             the validity of the proceedings connected with its
                                             adoption.
                                        The Constitution provides that amendments may be proposed
                                             in either branch of the General Assembly, and if the
                                             same shall be agreed to by a majority of the members
                                             elected to each of the two Houses, such proposed
                                             amendment or amendments, shall, with the yeas and nays
                                             thereon, be entered on their journals and referred to
                                             the General Assembly to be chosen at the next general
                                             election; and if in the General Assembly so next
                                             chosen, such proposed amendment or amendments shall be
                                             agreed to by a majority of all the members elected to
                                             each House, then it shall be the duty of the General
                                             Assembly to submit such amendment or amendments to the
                                             electors, etc. An inspection of the printed journals
                                             will show that the yeas and nays were called and
                                             recorded on the passage of the joint resolution in both
                                             Houses; that it passed the Senate by a vote of
                                             forty-five yeas to one nay; that it passed the House by
                                             a unanimous vote, ninety-three members voting for, and
                                             none against it. The Joint Resolution was duly
                                             enrolled, signed by the President of the Senate, and
                                             the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and is
                                             deposited in the office of the Secretary of State, and
                                             was printed and published with the laws passed at the
                                             same session, Under these circumstances, I am clear in
                                             the opinion that the omission to spread the amendment
                                             at large on the journals does not vitiate it. The
                                             provision which says that the amendment shall be
                                             entered on the journals, if indeed it means that it
                                             shall be copied at full length, is at most only
                                             directory and not mandatory, and consequently the
                                             amendment, if passed by the present General Assembly
                                             and ratified by the people, will be valid as a part of
                                             the Constitution.
                                        In this connection, I desire to call attention to the
                                             fact that the original manuscript journals of the
                                             Senate and House of Representatives are not preserved,
                                             but are sent to the Public Printer and used as copy
                                             from which to print, and then destroyed. The journals
                                             are printed after the adjournment of the General
                                             Assembly under the supervision of the Secretary of the
                                             Senate and the Clerk of the House respectively, and as
                                             the original manuscript is destroyed after the proof is read, there
                                             is no possible means of detecting or correcting any
                                             omission or mistake which might be made in the printed
                                             volume. I respectfully suggest that this practice ought
                                             to be discontinued and that the original manuscript
                                             journals should be bound in permanent form and
                                             preserved in the office of the Secretary of State and
                                             copies thereof furnished to the printer.
                                   
                                   
                                        THE LATE NORMAN EDDY.
                                        On the 28th day of January of the present year, Colonel
                                             Norman Eddy, Secretary of State, departed this life at
                                             his residence in this city, after having faithfully
                                             performed the duties of that office for about one year,
                                             or half the term for which he was elected. The singular
                                             beauty and integrity of Col. Eddy's public and
                                             private life, his gallant services as a soldier of the
                                             Union in the war to suppress the late rebellion, and
                                             the industry, fidelity and skill with which he
                                             performed the duties of the many public trusts to which
                                             he was called, render it fitting that I should leave on
                                             record this brief tribute to his memory. He died in
                                             circumstances by no means affluent, and Col. John H.
                                             Farquhar, whom I appointed to fill the vacancy,
                                             appointed Mr. Owen M. Eddy, son of the deceased
                                             Secretary, his deputy, and generously allowed the
                                             entire salary and all the perquisites of the office to
                                             go to the widow and family of his deceased predecessor.
                                             Although the labors of the office have been mainly
                                             performed by the deputy, its responsibilities and some
                                             of its cares and duties, have necessarily fallen upon
                                             Col. Farquhar, and I would consider myself remiss in
                                             duty if I did not thus publicly express my grateful
                                             appreciation of his conduct. May the bread which he has
                                             thus cast upon the waters be found by him or his,
                                             though it should be after many days.
                                   
                                   
                                        FEES AND SALARIES.
                                        The act of February 21, 1871, entitled "An act
                                             regulating the fees, salaries and duties of certain
                                             officers therein named, and prescribing penalties for
                                             the violation of its provisions," has proved
                                             to be a very defective and ill considered piece of
                                             legislation. Some of the provisions of the act are of
                                             such doubtful constitutionality that a portion of the
                                             Circuit and Common Pleas Judges have held them to be
                                             null and void, while the Judges of other circuits and
                                             districts have adjudged the same provisions to be
                                             constitutional. The Judges of the Supreme Court
                                             itself are equally divided on one or more of these
                                             questions, and therefore unable to reverse conflicting
                                             and contradictory decisions of the lower courts. The
                                             result is not only that we have all the evils of local
                                             legislation by having one law or rule of action in one
                                             county or circuit and another law or rule of action in
                                             the adjoining county or circuit, but diverse rules
                                             prevail in the same county where the Judges of the
                                             courts thereof differ in opinion as to the
                                             constitutionality of certain provisions of the act.
                                             This evil is even greater than the extortions that were
                                             practiced under the former law, and if a satisfactory
                                             fee and salary bill of unquestionable constitutionality
                                             can not be perfected and passed at the present session,
                                             it would be better to repeal the act alluded to and
                                             revive the old law which was supplanted by it, than to
                                             suffer longer under existing evils. There can be no
                                             question that the former law needed revision, and its
                                             revival could only be justified as a temporary
                                             expedient, until a just, constitutional and
                                             satisfactory measure can be perfected and passed. I
                                             respectfully recommend that a commission to consist of
                                             five or more experienced and competent persons be
                                             appointed with the least practicable delay, to prepare
                                             and report a fee and salary bill to the General
                                             Assembly for its consideration at the approaching
                                             regular session. The fact that the Judges of the
                                             Supreme Court are equally divided as to the
                                             constitutionality of some of the provisions of the
                                             present fee bill shows the necessity of having an odd
                                             instead of an even number of Judges on the bench of
                                             that Court. I, therefore, for this and other reasons,
                                             renew the recommendation made at the last session of
                                             the General Assembly, that provision be made for the
                                             addition of another Judge to the bench of the Supreme
                                             Court, so that the whole number of Judges shall be five
                                             instead of four. I also earnestly repeat the
                                             recommendation that the Judges of that court be allowed
                                             salaries commensurate with the dignity of their
                                             positions, and the learning and industry necessary for
                                             the performance of the duties of these positions. As I
                                             shall never again have a personal interest in the
                                             Governor's salary, I may now also be permitted
                                             to speak on that subject. For the credit of the State,
                                             and in justice to my successors, immediate and remote,
                                             I trust you will, before the commencement of the term
                                             of the Governor elect, provide a fixed and adequate
                                             salary for the office. If this matter is not attended
                                             to at this session, or before my successor shall have
                                             assumed the duties of the office, it can not be during
                                             his incumbency. The sum allowed should be fixed by the
                                             law-making power, but should be in the alternative;
                                             that is, so much as
                                             long as the State does not provide the Governor with a
                                             furnished residence, and a less sum if such a furnished
                                             residence is provided, and kept furnished and in repair
                                             by the State. I do not hesitate, after an experience of
                                             nearly six years, to say that if the Governor shall be
                                             required to provide his own residence, furnish it, and
                                             keep it in repair, eight thousand dollars per annum is
                                             as small a sum as should be contemplated; and if a
                                             furnished dwelling is provided by the State, the salary
                                             ought not to be less than five thousand dollars. I
                                             trust that no one upon whom the people may hereafter
                                             confer the office will be subjected to the annoyance
                                             which I have suffered in this connection.
                                   
                                   
                                        CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION.
                                        It is now more than twenty-one years since the present
                                             Constitution became the fundamental law of Indiana, and
                                             in my judgment the time has come when the best
                                             interests of the State require that provision should be
                                             made for calling a convention to be elected by the
                                             people, for the purpose of revising and amending that
                                             instrument.
                                        The thirteenth article, and all the other provisions of
                                             our Constitution which sought to degrade men and put
                                             them under the public ban because the complexion of
                                             their skins did not happen to conform to the approved
                                             Caucasian standard, are a reproach to the State, and
                                             ought to be stricken out by command of the sovereign
                                             people themselves. It is true that these provisions are
                                             now a dead letter, but they are still in the
                                             Constitution, and printed with it every time a new
                                             edition of that instrument is published, the standing
                                             witness of our ignorance of, or indifference to human
                                             rights, until God scourged us into their recognition by
                                             the dread calamity of civil war. Under the Constitution
                                             as it now is, it is impossible to have an election law
                                             that will be efficient in preventing fraudulent voting.
                                             As long as the Constitution neither prescribes nor
                                             allows the Legislature to prescribe some term of
                                             previous residence, in the county, township, or
                                             precinct, as a pre-requisite to the exercise of the
                                             right of suffrage, all efforts to prevent the
                                             importation of fraudulent voters must be nugatory. The
                                             Constitution itself ought to prescribe some term of
                                             residence in the proper locality as a condition
                                             precedent to the right to vote.
                                        There is little ground of hope that our judicial system
                                             will be reformed and adapted to the wants of the people
                                             until the Constitution shall itself have been
                                             remodeled, and it would require the exercise of superior ingenuity
                                             to devise a worse judicial system than that under which
                                             we now suffer. There is at present a great demand for
                                             civil service reform in the General Government, and in
                                             reference thereto, I join in the hope that the hand of
                                             reform may not be stayed until the nearest appoach to
                                             perfection possible in human affairs shall have been
                                             attained. I think, however, that the civil service of
                                             the State is not so perfect as to justify us in giving
                                             all our attention to that of the country at large. The
                                             management of our Benevolent, Reformatory and Penal
                                             Institutions is liable to be revolutionized by the
                                             triumph of this party or that at any general election.
                                             This ought not so to be, and there can be no effectual
                                             remedy without an amendment to the Constitution. The
                                             directors or managers of these institutions should hold
                                             for longer official terms than the Legislature is
                                             permitted to create, and a portion of them should go
                                             out every year, or every two years, so that the
                                             government thereof would be raised above the mutations
                                             of mere party and the requisite experience would always
                                             be preserved.
                                        The Judges of the Supreme Court, too, are all elected at
                                             the same time and for the same term of years, and
                                             always succeed as the nominees of a political party.
                                             The tendency of this is to make the judges partisans,
                                             and the fact that every sixth year the bench may be
                                             politically revolutionized, creates a temptation on the
                                             part of the successful candidates to attempt to secure
                                             favor with their party by undoing much of what their
                                             politically heterodox prodecessors have done. That in
                                             point of fact, we have had so little of this to
                                             complain of, is greatly to the credit of the judges who
                                             have from time to time succeeded to the bench, but the
                                             system itself is none the less vicious. If the
                                             judiciary ought to be elected by the people at all, a
                                             proposition, by the way, which I do not think
                                             experience has sanctioned, a portion only of the judges
                                             of the Supreme Court should retire and their successors
                                             be elected at the same time, so that the probabilities
                                             of the existence of a partisan bench would be
                                             diminished, and so that the Court would never be
                                             without judges of experience and familiar with the
                                             duties of the particular position.
                                        If this General Assembly should see proper to provide for
                                             calling a Constitutional Convention, I do not think it
                                             should, on that account, omit to adopt and submit to
                                             the people for ratification, the pending amendment in
                                             relation to the canal debt. Let that amendment by all
                                             means be adopted, and it can be submitted, without
                                             additional expense to the people, for ratification at
                                             the same election at which the delegates to the
                                             Convention shall be chosen, and if it is ratified, as assuredly it
                                             will be, the popular vote ratifying it will be an
                                             imperative instruction to the Convention to put a
                                             similar provision in the revised Constitution. Besides
                                             this, the pending amendment, if thus adopted and
                                             ratified, would bind the Legislature until the new
                                             Constitution shall have been approved by the people,
                                             and also provide against the possible contingency of
                                             the Convention framing such a Constitution as the
                                             people might reject.
                                   
                                   
                                        ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR THE
                                             INSANE.
                                        The Indiana Hospital for the Insane has a capacity for
                                             about 490 patients, although by crowding it 520
                                             patients have been in the institution at the same time.
                                             Experience proves that it ought not to be thus crowded.
                                             By making the additions and improvements suggested by
                                             the Superintendent in his report, the capacity of the
                                             institution can be so enlarged as to accommodate 600
                                             patients, that being an addition to the present
                                             capacity of the buildings of rooms sufficient for 110
                                             patients. The estimated cost of these additions and
                                             improvements is $50,000, a much less sum than would
                                             provide for the same number of patients in the erection
                                             of a new institution. For this reason, and because of
                                             the pressing necessity for increased accommodations for
                                             the insane, I urgently recommend that an appropriation
                                             of the sum named above be made at the present session,
                                             and with as little delay as practicable, so that the
                                             capacity of the Hospital may be increased at the
                                             earliest possible day. By doing this, however, the
                                             State will not have performed her duty to the insane
                                             within her borders. When the capacity of the present
                                             Hospital shall have been increased so as to accommodate
                                             600 patients, there will undoubtedly be 1,000 insane
                                             persons within the State who ought to have the care and
                                             treatment afforded by such an institution, still
                                             unprovided for. To properly provide for these, the
                                             State needs two other Hospitals, each having a capacity
                                             for the accommodation of at least 500 patients. The
                                             State should be divided into three Hospital districts,
                                             viz.: a central, a northern and a southern. One new
                                             Hospital should be established as near the center of
                                             the northern and another as near the center of the
                                             southern district as may be found practicable. The
                                             State of Ohio already has five such institutions. To
                                             erect, furnish and equip two additional Hospitals for
                                             the Insane, each having a capacity for 500 patients,
                                             will cost about $1,000,000; but our people can better
                                             afford to furnish this amount within the next three
                                             years than they can allow the State to fall be- hind her sister
                                             States in providing for this unfortunate class of her
                                             citizens. The idea that those who are supposed to be
                                             incurably insane should be provided for in separate
                                             institutions has been exploded by experience, and I
                                             trust will find no favor in the action which you may
                                             take on the subject. At least one new Hospital should
                                             be erected as soon as possible, and provision for all
                                             the insane who need care and treatment should be
                                             secured at no distant day.
                                   
                                   
                                        TIPPECANOE BATTLE GROUND.
                                        The Constitution of Indiana declares, that it shall be
                                             the duty of the General Assembly to provide for the
                                             permanent inclosure and preservation of the Tippecanoe
                                             Battle Ground. Allow me to call your attention to the
                                             fact that this duty has never been performed by your
                                             predecessors. The Battle Ground never was permanently
                                             inclosed by the State, and the temporary fence by which
                                             it was once surrounded has long since disappeared. It
                                             is the property of the State, and full of historic
                                             interest, and as the people have enjoined in their
                                             Constitution that it shall be permanently inclosed and
                                             preserved, I can imagine no valid excuse for a failure
                                             to obey this injunction.
                                   
                                   
                                        TREATY OF WASHINGTON.
                                        By the Twenty-seventh Article of the Treaty of
                                             Washington, concluded between the United States and
                                             Great Britain, May 8,1871, the Government of Her
                                             Britannic Majesty engages to urge upon the Government
                                             of the Dominion of Canada to secure to the citizens of
                                             the United States the use of the Welland, St. Lawrence
                                             and other canals in the Dominion on terms of equality
                                             with the inhabitants of the Dominion; and the
                                             Government of the United States engages that the
                                             subjects of Her Britannic Majesty shall enjoy the use
                                             of the St. Clair Flats Canal on terms of equality with
                                             the inhabitants of the United States, and further
                                             engages to urge upon the State Governments to secure to
                                             the subjects of Her Britannic Majesty the use of the
                                             several State canals connected with the navigation of
                                             the lakes or rivers traversed by or contiguous to the
                                             boundary line between the possessions of the high
                                             contracting parties on terms of equality with the
                                             inhabitants of the United States.
                                        I herewith respectfully submit for your consideration a
                                             copy of an official communication from the President of
                                             the United States to myself, calling attention to the provisions of the
                                             above mentioned article of said Treaty, and urging upon
                                             the State Government of this State to secure to the
                                             subjects of Her Britannic Majesty the use of the State
                                             canals within the State of Indiana connected with the
                                             navigation of the lakes or rivers traversed by or
                                             contiguous to the boundary line between the possessions
                                             of the United States and those of Her Britannic Majesty
                                             in North America on terms of equality with the
                                             inhabitants of the United States.
                                        I commend the subject to your careful attention, in the
                                             hope that it may be found practicable to adopt such
                                             legislation as will accomplish the object suggested by
                                             the President in said communication.
                                   
                                   
                                        HOUSE OF REFUGE.
                                        The House of Refuge, near Plainfield, has been very
                                             successful in performing the good work for which it was
                                             established, although it has had to encounter many
                                             obstacles. For some three years it has had two hundred
                                             or more inmates, but the appropriations for its current
                                             expenses were made upon the basis, and intended for the
                                             support of but a few more than half that number. At the
                                             commencement of the last session of the Legislature a
                                             debt of $10,000 for borrowed money had accrued, owing
                                             to the deficiency in the appropriations, and this debt
                                             has since been added to until it now amounts to
                                             $18,881. Besides this loan, the institution is indebted
                                             to supplies to the amout of about $3,500, making a
                                             total indebtedness of $22,881. It will require about
                                             $4,000 to meet the expenses of the institution up to
                                             the first day of April next, the end of its fiscal
                                             year. I therefore ask that an appropriation of $26,881
                                             be made to this institution with the least practicable
                                             delay, to enable it to discharge the present
                                             indebtedness and defray current expenses to the end of
                                             the fiscal year. I herewith respectfully submit a
                                             special report of the Board of Control of the House of
                                             Refuge, in which the foregoing matters are more fully
                                             explained. Provision should also be made to enlarge the
                                             institution so as to double its present capacity. The
                                             eleventh section of the act creating the institution
                                             ought to be repealed. That section authorizes the
                                             sentencing of boys to the House of Refuge for any
                                             determinate period, not extending beyond the time when
                                             they shall attain the age of twenty-one years. No one
                                             can judge in advance how long it will require to reform
                                             any particular juvenile delinquent, and hence the
                                             impropriety of a sentence for a definite period. If a
                                             boy is thus sentenced he must be discharged at the end of
                                             the term for which he was sentenced, although his
                                             reformation may have but fairly commenced. Every boy
                                             who is thus discharged before his reformation is
                                             completed is almost sure to relapse into his former
                                             vicious courses, and therefore is not benefited
                                             himself, but reflects discredit upon the institution
                                             and tends to impair the public confidence in its
                                             efficiency. Besides this, any juvenile offender may
                                             under other sections of the act be committed to the
                                             guardianship of the institution until he attains the
                                             age of twenty-one years, unless sooner discharged as
                                             reformed, without having a record of conviction of
                                             crime made against him, and there is therefore no
                                             necessity for the section above mentioned. The law
                                             governing the admission of boys to the institution
                                             should also be so changed as not to allow those under
                                             the age of nine or over the age of sixteen years to be
                                             committed to its guardianship. The institution is not a
                                             prison, and is not therefore a proper place for the
                                             punishment of young men convicted of crimes; nor should
                                             it be converted into a nursery for quite small
                                             children. If even the maximum age shall be reduced from
                                             eighteen to sixteen years, as I have suggested, still
                                             it may be expected that, by fraudulent representations
                                             as to the age of delinquents, boys will be sent to the
                                             institution who have passed the proper age; but as it
                                             now is, some young men over the age of twenty-one years
                                             are, through false representations as to their ages,
                                             committed to the House of Refuge to save them from
                                             being sent to the Penitentiary. This is highly
                                             injurious to the institution and detrimental to the
                                             best interests of its younger inmates. We ought to have
                                             a prison intermediate between the House of Refuge and
                                             the Penitentiary, but the House of Refuge can not
                                             perform the functions of such a prison.
                                        If the House of Refuge should be enlarged so as double
                                             its capacity it would still be unable to receive all
                                             the boys who require the reforming influence of such an
                                             establishment. A few of the larger cities of the State
                                             would furnish boys enough to fill such an institution.
                                             In view of this, the larger cities of the State should
                                             not only be empowered, but encouraged to establish
                                             similar institutions. The Board of Commissioners of the
                                             counties in which such cities are located might, with
                                             propriety, be authorized to join with the city
                                             authorities in their establishment, and the State
                                             could, in my judgment, well afford to contribute a part
                                             of the funds necessary to defray the current expenses
                                             of such institutions after they shall have been
                                             established by the local authorities.
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                        SOLDIERS' HOME.
                                        Since the termination of last session of the General
                                             Assembly, the old wooden buildings belonging to the
                                             Soldiers' Home near Knightstown, were
                                             destroyed by fire. They were at the time of the fire
                                             occupied as quarters for disabled soldiers then
                                             connected with the institution, the new brick building
                                             being then and still occupied by the soldiers'
                                             orphans who have been admitted to the Home. In
                                             consequence of the fire all the soldiers who were
                                             willing to go to the National Soldiers' Home,
                                             near Dayton, Ohio, were sent to that institution, and
                                             those who were unwilling to go there were, in
                                             accordance with their own preferences, discharged.
                                             Since then the Home has been exclusively for the care
                                             of the orphan children of soldiers. It is inexpedient
                                             and unnecessary to rebuild the soldiers'
                                             department of the Home, and the act creating the
                                             institution should therefore be so far modified as to
                                             sanction the change in the character of the institution
                                             caused by the destruction of the soldiers'
                                             quarters. It would be good policy as well as sound
                                             economy in my opinon to provide for increasing the
                                             quantity of land connected with the institution and for
                                             creating the work shops which may be necessary to
                                             utilize the labor of the children and impart to them at
                                             the same time industrious habits.
                                        Up to this time the number of soldiers' orphans
                                             applying for and entitled to admission, has equalled or
                                             exceeded the capacity of the institution, but the
                                             probabilities are that the time will soon come when the
                                             number of soldiers' orphans entitled to
                                             admission will be go reduced as to permit the admission
                                             of other indigent children. In anticipation of this, I
                                             think provision should be made by law for the admission
                                             of children from the county asylums of the several
                                             counties wherever such can be admitted without
                                             excluding any of the class of orphan children now
                                             entitled to its benefits. When the property shall no
                                             longer be required as a home for soldiers'
                                             orphans, it will be well adapted to and much needed
                                             for, an Industrial Reform School, somewhat different in
                                             character from the House of Refuge. Such a school, in
                                             which the waifs of society should be collected and
                                             cared for before they become delinquents, would be a
                                             blessing to the State and cut off one of the sources
                                             through which the criminal classes of our people are
                                             increased.
                                   
                                   
                                        THE STATE NORMAL SCHOOL.
                                        The State Normal School has been embarrassed for the want
                                             of the means
                                             necessary to carry on its operations. A loan of $4,000
                                             became an imperative necessity, and was made. I believe
                                             there is some other floating debt which ought to be
                                             liquidated without delay. I trust the necessary
                                             appropriation will be promptly made.
                                   
                                   
                                        THE INSTITUTION FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE
                                             BLIND.
                                        For four years or more, there has been a pressing
                                             necessity for the enlargement of the Institution for
                                             the Education of the Blind, the increase of this class
                                             of our population being such that the present building
                                             has become too small to accommodate all who are
                                             entitled to the benefits of the institution. The
                                             estimates made prior to the meeting of the last
                                             Legislature, stated $65,000 as the amount necessary to
                                             make this enlargement. I believe these estimates were
                                             correct, and earnestly recommend that such an
                                             appropriation be made without delay.
                                   
                                   
                                        THE INDIANA REFORMATORY INSTITUTE FOR
                                             WOMEN AND GIRLS.
                                        The building for this much needed institution has
                                             remained in an unfinished condition for the last two
                                             years, no appropriation having been made to complete
                                             it. It is highly important that the building should be
                                             speedily completed and furnished, to the end that the
                                             female prisoners now in the State Prison at
                                             Jeffersonville should be removed thereto, pursuant to
                                             the requirements of the act for the establishment of
                                             the institution. It is also highly important, that the
                                             reformatory department of the institution should be
                                             open for the reception of girls at the earliest
                                             practicable period.
                                        There is an existing indebtedness of about $20,000,
                                             contracted in the erection of the building, and I trust
                                             that an appropriation will be made to pay this, and
                                             also to complete and furnish the building, fence the
                                             grounds, and put the institution in operation.
                                   
                                   
                                        STATE PRISON SOUTH.
                                        I herewith respectfully submit the annual report of the
                                             Directors and Warden of the State Prison South. I hope
                                             that the indebtedness of the prison mentioned in this
                                             report, which was necessarily and unavoidably incurred,
                                             may be speedily provided for. The contracts for the
                                             labor of the convicts have four years to run from the
                                             1st day of January next, and in my opinion there should
                                             be no extension of these contracts, but steps should be
                                             taken looking to the abandonment of this prison by the
                                             time the present contracts expire. The prison buildings
                                             are old, dilapidated, and not well adapted to the
                                             purposes for which they are used. The cells are too
                                             small, and to continue the prison will necessitate
                                             expenditures for repairs to such an extent as to render
                                             it better economy to provide a new prison of a milder
                                             grade than the one now under consideration. In my
                                             opinion, one prison of this grade is sufficient for the
                                             State, and the one at Michigan City, being a new and a
                                             good one, should be retained and the one at
                                             Jeffersonville abandoned. There should be graded
                                             prisons and a classification of prisoners. To effect
                                             this there should be substituted for the Prison South,
                                             a prison of milder type, intermediate between the House
                                             of Refuge and the State Prison at Michigan City. To
                                             this milder prison, young men too old for the House of
                                             Refuge, and older persons who have been overtaken by a
                                             first offense under mitigating circumstances, should be
                                             sent, so that such offenders may not be associated or
                                             put on an equality with professional criminals. If such
                                             a prison should be established, provision should be
                                             made for the transfer of incorrigible prisoners, who
                                             may evince a determination not to reform, to the State
                                             Prison at Michigan City, and power should also be
                                             lodged somewhere, to transfer prisoners who give
                                             satisfactory evidence of reformation, from the
                                             penitentiary to the intermediate prison. Such last
                                             mentioned transfers might be probationary in their
                                             character, and revocable if the prisoner ceased to
                                             deserve the favor shown him. Prisoners even of the
                                             worst classes are still human beings, governed by the
                                             tame motives which influence others, and with the
                                             proper care and proper appliances, I am satisfied that
                                             a majority of them, instead of being made worse by
                                             their imprisonment, can be restored to their lost
                                             manhood.
                                        The Constitution declares that "the penal code
                                             shall be founded on the principles of reformation, and
                                             not of vindictive justice." In the spirit of
                                             this humane provision, I plead for graded prisons and
                                             for a classification of prisoners. Prisons are the only
                                             schools in which the criminal classes can be reformed
                                             and taught, and there is just the same necessity for
                                             gradation and classification as there is in other
                                             schools. There ought to be also a supervisory board,
                                             having control of all prison officers, with power of
                                             suspension or removal for cause during the vacations of
                                             the General Assembly. Under the the existing
                                             arrangement the grossest abuses may exist when the
                                             General Assembly is not in session, but there is no
                                             power to interfere.
                                        I believe that between now and the expiration of the
                                             contracts for the
                                             labor of the convicts in the Southern Prison the change
                                             in our prison system, which I have so briefly and
                                             imperfectly sketched, may be accomplished in accordance
                                             with the soundest economy, and in consonance with the
                                             latest and best achievements in this particular field
                                             of social science.
                                   
                                   
                                        SOLDIERS' MONUMENT.
                                        I herewith respectfully submit the memorial of the Board
                                             of Managers of the Indiana Monumental Association,
                                             soliciting State aid to the erection of a monument to
                                             the memory of Indiana soldiers who periled their lives
                                             in the service of their country. The memorial embodies
                                             resolutions in favor of the same object of a large
                                             meeting of citizens held at Indianapolis in May last,
                                             upon the occasion of the decoration of the
                                             soldiers' graves at Crown Hill near that city.
                                             I cordially commend the memorial, with the subject to
                                             which it relates, to your favorable consideration.
                                        I trust that the session upon which you have just entered
                                             will be characterized by perfect harmony and will be
                                             fruitful of good legislation, and assure you of my
                                             desire to co-operate with you in furthering such
                                             results.
                                   
                                   
                                        CONRAD BAKER.
                                   
                              
                         
                    
               
               
               
               
                    COMMUNICATION FROM  GOVERNOR CONRAD BAKER  IN
                         RELATION TO THE  INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT BONDS.
                    
                         
                              
                                   
                                        Gentlemen of the House of
                                             Representatives:
                                   
                                   I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of a
                                        preamble and three separate resolutions, passed by the House
                                        on the 19th ultimo, in relation to the Indiana bonds or
                                        stocks held by John W. Garrett, Esq., and other kindred
                                        matters.
                                   I was not in possession of all the information requested by
                                        the resolutions, and an effort to procure it has caused the
                                        delay in my response.
                                   The first of the three resolutions above mentioned, requests
                                        me to inform the House:
                                   First. Under what authority of the State of
                                        Indiana the bonds held by Garrett were issued?
                                   Second. The date of the act under which they
                                        were issued?
                                   Third. The amount of principal, interest and
                                        costs the State Treasury will have to furnish if the bonds
                                        are paid according to my recommendation?
                                   In response to the first and second of these inquiries, I beg
                                        leave .to say that
                                        according to the proofs taken in the case now pending in the
                                        Cass Circuit Court, wherein said Garrett is plaintiff, and
                                        the Trustees of the Wabash and Erie Canal, and others, are
                                        defendants, the said Garaett holds thirty one dollar bonds
                                        of $1,000 each, and ten sterling bonds for 225 sterling
                                        each. They were issued by and under the authority of the
                                        General Assembly of this State contained in the act
                                        hereinafter referred to. The thirty one dollar bonds were
                                        issued under the act approved January 27, 1836, entitled
                                        "An Act to provide for a General System of Internal
                                        Improvements." (See Revised Statutes of 1836, page
                                        341, section 8.
                                   Nine of the ten sterling bonds held by Garrett were issued
                                        under the same act. The one other sterling bond held by said
                                        Garrett was issued under the act of February 12, 1839, and I
                                        apprehend is not a lien upon the canal, or any of the public
                                        works formerly owned by the State.
                                   As to the amount of principal and interest that the treasury
                                        would be required to furnish to pay these forty-one bonds,
                                        if the General Assembly shall direct their payment, I am not
                                        prepared to give exact information, as it involves questions
                                        of interest and exchange, requiring long and tedious
                                        calculations, which I have not time to make. These questions
                                        have been referred to a Special Master, with directions to
                                        report thereon to the Court by the 27th instant. The amount,
                                        however, due to Garrett will not vary largely from $160,000,
                                        including principal, interest and exchange. As to the costs,
                                        I have no means of forming even an approximate estimate.
                                   For the information of the House, I herewith respectfully
                                        transmit a copy of one of the dollar bonds, and also one of
                                        the Sterling bonds, held by Garrett, with a copy of one of
                                        the unpaid coupons thereto attached, and marked respectively
                                        "A" and "B."
                                   No interest has been paid on any of these bonds since January
                                        1, 1841. The above estimate of $160,000 only includes the
                                        bonds held by Garrett, and does not include those held by
                                        others who may become parties to the suit.
                                   The second of said resolutions to which this is a response,
                                        requests me to inform the House under what authority of the
                                        State of Indiana the bonds held by William H. Beers and
                                        others whose payment was sought to be enforced by suit in
                                        the Circuit Court of the UnitedStates some ten years since,
                                        were issued, the date of the act authorizing their issue,
                                        the amount of the said bonds with interest and costs, and
                                        what was the final issue of said legal proceeding subsequent
                                        to the decision of the United States Supreme Court, reported
                                        in 2 Black's Supreme Court Reports, and whether said bonds are paid,
                                        and if so who paid them, and what amount the
                                        Trustee's of the Wabash and Erie Canal were
                                        compelled to disburse out of the trust funds in consequence
                                        of said litigation.
                                   In response to this resolution, I beg leave to say that, the
                                        case of Beers vs. The Trustees of the Wabash and Erie Canal,
                                        reported in 2 Black, page 448, and referred to in the
                                        resolution, itself shows that Beers held two bonds of $1,000
                                        each, which were the foundation of this suit, and that they
                                        were issued under the act of the General Assembly of Indiana
                                        of the 7th of January, 1832. Said bonds, as already stated,
                                        were for the sum of $1,000 each, but I have no means of
                                        information, except the communication of Hon. Thomas
                                        Dowling, hereinafter referred to, as to the amount of
                                        interest that accrued or was paid on said bonds, or as to
                                        the costs that accrued or were paid in the suit. I am
                                        informed that the Circuit Court of the United States, after
                                        the case was sent back from the Supreme Court, made a decree
                                        in conformity with the opinion of the Supreme Court
                                        enforcing the payment of the bonds, and that they were paid,
                                        together with the interest and costs by the Trustees of the
                                        Wabash and Erie Canal. All the information I have in these
                                        matters I derive from a letter written, at my request, to me
                                        by Hon. Thomas Dowling, resident Trustee of the Wabash and
                                        Erie Canal, a copy of which I herewith respectfully submit,
                                        marked "C," and I have no doubt of the
                                        correctness of the statements therein made.
                                   The third resolution requests me to give my opinion
                                        "whether, if the State, out of abundant precaution,
                                        with accustomed generosity, ex gratia,
                                        makes provision for the payment of the Garrett bonds, as
                                        recommended," etc., "the State will ever
                                        in the future be threatened or harrassed on account of
                                        unsurrendered internal improvement bonds by any other person
                                        or persons, or by any corporation, trust or other source
                                        whatever, and whether such payment by the State can be
                                        construed into a breach of plighted faith on the part of the
                                        State by reason of the latter proviso of section 8 of an act
                                        approved January 27, 1847, being an act supplemental to an
                                        act commonly called the Butler Bill."
                                   In response to the first part of this resolution, I beg leave
                                        to say that I do not consider the redemption of the bonds
                                        held by Mr. Garrett, or the redemption of other similar
                                        bonds held by others, still outstanding, to be at all a
                                        matter of generosity or mere favor to the bondholders. If I
                                        did so consider it, I should never recommend their payment.
                                        In my judgment, it is a matter of duty and not a matter of favor on the part of
                                        the State to pay these bonds, because they were issued by
                                        her authority and she pledged her faith for their payment,
                                        and because she is abundantly able to pay them. I think it
                                        is perfectly clear, from all the evidence that can be
                                        attained, that the whole number of old bonds still
                                        outstanding, issued prior to the year 1841, does not exceed
                                        one hundred and ninety-one (191), a majority of these being
                                        dollar bonds of $1,000 each, and the rest being sterling
                                        bonds of two hundred and twenty-five pounds sterling each,
                                        one of the latter being equivalent in value to one of the
                                        former.
                                   I suppose that the payment of the forty-one bonds held by Mr.
                                        Garrett will imply the duty on the part of the State of
                                        paying the remaining one hundred and fifty by whomsoever
                                        held, and I have on several occasions recommended, and now
                                        recommend, the payment of all of them. If this shall be
                                        done, I can not imagine how, or by whom the State could be
                                        threatened or harrassed on account of unsurrendered Internal
                                        Improvement bonds from any quarter whatever, for the simple
                                        reason that there will then be no other old bonds of the
                                        State upon which to predicate threats or annoyance.
                                   I might say that the evidence taken in the case pending in
                                        Cass county has accounted for one hundred and fifty-four of
                                        the one hundred and ninety-one old bonds still supposed to
                                        be outstanding, by showing where and by whom they are held,
                                        leaving thirty-seven thereof still unaccounted for. I
                                        believe that some of these thirty-seven bonds will never be
                                        presented or accounted for, as it would be wonderful if some
                                        of them, after the lapse of so long a time, had not been
                                        lost or destroyed, especially when it is considered that no
                                        interest has been paid on them since 1841, and in
                                        consequence thereof the holders would be likely to esteem
                                        them of little value.
                                   As to the question whether the payment by the State of these
                                        old bonds can be construed into a breach of plighted faith
                                        on her part, by reason of the latter proviso of Section 8,
                                        of the Act approved January 27, 1847, I beg leave to submit
                                        it as my opinion that no such conclusion can be justly drawn
                                        from the payment if it shall be made.
                                   The proviso to which the resolution refers reads as follows,
                                        viz.:
                                   "Provided further, That the State
                                        will make no provision whatever hereafter to pay either
                                        principal or interest on any Internal Improvement bond or
                                        bonds until the holder or holders thereof shall have first
                                        surrendered said bonds to the Agent of State, and shall have received in lieu
                                        thereof certificates of stock as provided in the first
                                        section of this Act."
                                   In my judgment, this provision is void in morals and in law,
                                        because it stipulates that the State will not perform its
                                        obligations to its creditors until they shall acede to
                                        material conditions not contained in the orignal contract.
                                        Such a stipulation between a natural person who was
                                        indebted, with one or more of his creditors, that he would
                                        never pay the rest of his creditors unless they acceded to
                                        new conditions not contained in the original contracts,
                                        would be null and void, and the Courts, instead of
                                        compelling the debtor to perform such stipulation would
                                        compel him to break it by paying his debts to the extent of
                                        his ability. Sovereignties who can not be sued ought to do
                                        voluntarily the same things which individuals, under like
                                        circumstances, would be compelled by the Courts to do.
                                   Besides, these bonds were contracts of the State, protected by
                                        that clause of the Constitution of the United States which
                                        prohibits States from passing laws impairing the obligation
                                        of contracts.
                                   The Supreme Court, in the case in 2 Black, before alluded to,
                                        expressly hold that the Legislature of Indiana could not, by
                                        the Act of 1847, impair the obligation of her contracts
                                        previously made.
                                   It is worthy of note that the holders of the Canal Stocks
                                        charged exclusively upon the Wabash and Erie Canal, have,
                                        within the last two weeks, presented to both Houses of this
                                        General Assembly their printed protest against the payment
                                        of these old bonds. Now, if their payment would, as is
                                        assumed by some, create an obligation on the part of the
                                        State to pay the canal debt, is it possible that the holders
                                        of this debt would protest against the doing of the very
                                        thing which would secure to them the payment of their debt,
                                        or at least create on the part of the State an obligation to
                                        pay it? The very fact that they thus protest is conclusive
                                        to my mind that the Garrett suit was commenced and
                                        prosecuted in the interests of the holders of the Canal
                                        Stocks, and that they desired that Garrett's lien
                                        should be enforced by a decree of sale or sequestration, and
                                        the trust thereby destroyed so that they might make this
                                        destruction the basis of a claim against the State for the
                                        payment of the Canal debt.
                                   
                                        Respectfully submitted,
                                        CONRAD BAKER,

                    Indiana Internal Improvement Loan, under the act of January 27, 1836.
                    N. M. Rothschild & Sons, London, pay to the bearer £5 12s.
                         6d. sterling, being a half-year's interest on bond No. 2538, due
                         July 1, 1841.
                    M. STAPP,
                    Commissioner.
               
               
               
                    EXHIBIT C.
                    TERRE HAUTE, Nov. 25, 1872.
                    MY DEAR GOVERNOR:--At your request, I
                         have examined our record in regard to the redemption, by order of Court, of
                         four original Wabash and Erie Canal Bonds, of the issue
                         of August, 1832. These bonds were sold to parties in New York by William C.
                         Linton, Nicholas McCarty and Jeremiah Sullivan, Commissioners, the General
                         Assembly of Indiana, in January, 1832, having authorized a loan of
                         $200,000, for the purpose of commencing the construction
                         of the Canal aforesaid. This was the first loan made by the State for
                         Internal Improvement purposes. Bonds 69 and 70 were held by Joseph D.
                         Beers, and 53 and 54 by Israel Cohen. These bonds were redeemed in New
                         York, at the office of Charles Butler, one of the Trustees of the Canal,
                         and report made to the office at Terra Haute of such payment. The amount
                         paid to the estate of J. D. Beers, for Bonds 69 and 70, principal and
                         interest, was $7,225.46, and to Israel Cohen $5,026.55. But this was only a
                         partial settlement as to Cohen's bonds. That gentleman
                         subsequently procured an order of the Court ordering the payment of interest on the coupons from the date
                         of their maturity. This additional sum was added to the redemption of bonds
                         Nos. 53 and 54, equal to the sum paid to the estate of Beers. As the bonds
                         were of the same date, with like number of coupons attached, the redemption
                         of these four bonds cost the Board of Trustees the gross sum of
                         $14,450.92.
                    The Board also expended considerable sums of money in defending the validity
                         of the Acts of 1846--'47. They not only were compelled to pay
                         attorneys of their own selection, but the Courts, in their wisdom, decreed
                         that adverse counsel should also be paid out of the Trust funds. They were
                         so paid in obedience to such decrees.
                    In the cases of Beers and Cohen, John Ferguson and others, and J. M. Garrett,
                         the Trustees have endeavored to defend the legislation of the State from
                         adverse interference, thus incurring expenses which you justly recommended
                         to the attention of the General Assembly. This account will be made up
                         whenever called for by the Governor.
                    Very truly, your obedient servant,
                    THOS. DOWLING,
                         Res. Trustee of W. and E. Canal.
                    HIS EXCELLENCY, CONRAD BAKER, Indianapolis, Ind.
               
               
               
                    MEMORIAL.
                    PURDUE UNIVERSITY.
                    
                         
                              
                                   To the General Assembly of the State of
                                        Indiana:
                                   The Indiana Agricultural College, now called Purdue
                                        University, realized, in currency, two hundred and twelve
                                        thousand two hundred and thirty-eight dollars and fifty
                                        cents ($212,238.50) from the sales of the land-scrip donated
                                        by the United States. With this money, government bonds were
                                        purchased; and a part of the interest accruing on said bonds
                                        has been invested in a similar manner. Hence at at the
                                        present time Purdue University has two hundred and fifty
                                        thousand dollars ($250,000) of bonds commonly called
                                        5-20's, and twenty thousand ($20,000) of currency
                                        6's; all of which are registered. For these bonds
                                        there has been paid, in currency, two hundred and ninety-two
                                        thousand one hundred and seventy-seven dollars and
                                        eighty-seven cents ($292,177.87.) There are also in the
                                        Treasury of the University, seven thousand one hundred and
                                        sixty-seven dollars and fifty-two cents ($7,167.52) in
                                        currency--being a balance of the interest received.
                                   The present currency value of this fund derived from the sale
                                        of land-script, is three hundred and fourteen thousand and
                                        sixty-seven dollars and fifty-two cents ($314,067.52) and
                                        the annual interest thereon is fifteen thousand dollars
                                        ($15,000) in gold, and twelve hundred dollars ($1,200) in
                                        currency. In addition to this, it is confidently expected
                                        that Congress, at the approaching session, will largely
                                        increase the former grant to the States and thus enable the
                                        "Agricultural Colleges" to do the work
                                        they were intended to perform without any assistance from
                                        the States for current expenses. (A Bill
                                        is now pending in the U. S. Senate which donates one million acres of the
                                        public lands to each Agricultural College.)
                                   By act of Congress and in accordance with the legislation of
                                        Indiana: "No portion of said fund"
                                        (heretofore received from the United States land grant)
                                        "nor any interest thereon, shall be applied
                                        directly or indirectly, under any pretence whatever, to the
                                        purchase, erection, preservation or repair of any building
                                        or buildings."
                                   Besides the funds above specified, Mr. John Purdue obligated
                                        himself to pay one hundred and fifty thousand dollars
                                        (150,000) for the benefit of the University, in yearly
                                        installments of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) and
                                        Tippecanoe county agreed to donate fifty thousand dollars
                                        ($50,000) in annual installments of ten thousand dollars
                                        ($10,000.) Also, certain citizens in the vicinity of
                                        Lafayette gave one hundred (100) acres of very eligible land
                                        on which to locate the University.
                                   As a tract of one hundred acres was considered too small to
                                        meet the wants of an Agricultural College, eighty-four (84)
                                        acres of land lying in the best possible position to the
                                        land donated, were bought at a cost of twenty-four thousand
                                        dollars ($24,000.) The sum of thirty-two thousand dollars
                                        ($32,000) has been appropriated and in part expended for the
                                        erection of a dormitory for students. And for laying the
                                        foundation for the main college building, and for a dwelling
                                        house and barn, an additional sum of about ten thousand
                                        dollars ($10,000) has been expended.
                                   Mr. Purdue has so far redeemed his pledge, that another
                                        installment will not be due from him until May, 1874.
                                   To meet the pledge of Tippecanoe county, the Board of
                                        Commissioners issued orders on the County Treasurer as the
                                        installments became due, to wit: for ten thousand dollars
                                        ($10,000) May, 1870; for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) May,
                                        1871; and for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) May, 1872. The
                                        first of these orders was paid last summer; the last two
                                        were presented for payment as soon as drawn, but not paid
                                        for want of funds. They with accrued interest will probably
                                        be paid early in the year 1873.
                                   At their session in August, 1872, the Board of Trustees of
                                        Purdue University ordered the erection of a dormitory with
                                        thirty-two (32) suits of rooms--three rooms to a suit; which
                                        was at once placed under contract, to be completed for
                                        thirty-two thousand dollars ($32,000.) This building is now
                                        up to the third story. The Trustees also ordered that
                                        arrangements be made to build, with as little delay as
                                        possible, a Chemical Laboratory after the plan of the new
                                        Laboratory of Brown University, at a probable cost of
                                        fifteen thou-  sand
                                        dollars ($15,000;) and a Boarding House, the plans of which
                                        were ordered, and are in process of completion, at an
                                        estimated cost of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.)
                                   And it is designed to proceed in erecting the main College
                                        edifice, the basement of which has been built in part. This
                                        main building will require for its completion, about
                                        seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.) All these
                                        structures are imperatively necessary to the successful
                                        opening of the Institution for the reception of students;
                                        and if the requisite means can be placed at the command of
                                        the Board of Trustees, these buildings can and will be
                                        completed by the autumn of 1873.
                                   In addition to buildings, there will be needed for the
                                        purchase of Chemical, Philisophical and Mathematical
                                        Apparatus, ten thousand dollars ($10,000;) for a Museum, ten
                                        thousand dollars ($10,000;) for a Conservatory, five
                                        thousand dollars ($5,000;) for a Library, ten thousand
                                        dollars ($10,000;) for fencing and ornamenting grounds of
                                        University, five thousand dollars ($5,000;) for boring an
                                        Artesian Well, five thousand dollars ($5,000;) for purchase
                                        of Farm Implements and Machinery, five thousand dollars
                                        ($5,000;) for purchasing stock of Horses, Cattle, Sheep and
                                        Swine, five thousand dollars ($5,000;) and for erecting a
                                        Barn and Shedding for stock, farm machinery and crops, ten
                                        thousand dollars ($10,000.)
                                   Thus, in the opinion of the Trustees, it will require at least
                                        one hundred and sixty-seven thousand dollars ($167,000)
                                        between this and mid-summer of next year, to put the
                                        buildings and other appliances of Purdue University in
                                        condition to open for the reception and instruction of
                                        students, on a basis which will compare favorably with
                                        kindred Institutions in other States. And at most, the
                                        Trustees can have within that time, from present resources,
                                        only the $40,000 donated and falling due from Tippecanoe
                                        county.
                                   Under these circumstances, no alternative is left but to apply
                                        to the Legislature of the State of Indiana for an
                                        appropriation, at their present session of one hundred
                                        thousand dollars ($100,000.) And we, the Trustees of Purdue
                                        University, hereby pray that such appropriation be made.
                                   This may seem a large sum to ask, but when all the
                                        circumstances are considered, that impression will probably
                                        be entirely removed. There are but three State Educational
                                        Institutions, and those who feel a State pride, such as we
                                        believe animates your Honorable Body, and who reflect that
                                        those Institutions are thrown open to the sons and daughters
                                        of every citizen of Indiana; that even the courses of  Law and Medicine, and
                                        preparation for teaching are completed without any charge
                                        for tuition; we can then see readily why the
                                        Legislature--emulating with commendable rivalry our sister
                                        States of the West--has already made liberal appropriations
                                        for building and conducting the State Normal School, and
                                        will probably feel justified in granting the further sums
                                        asked for that Institution. From the same stand point, we
                                        submit, it can well be seen why this General Assembly should
                                        also grant to the State University the sum needed to erect a
                                        suitable building to contain the cabinet recently purchased
                                        by the Trustees, and an annual sum sufficient to make the
                                        income adequate to the position and wants of that
                                        Institution.
                                   If these liberal appropriations already made and those we hope
                                        soon will be made to the Normal School and to the State
                                        University are just, and such as a wise and generous policy
                                        dictates--which we fully conceive to be the case--then we
                                        ask that the same wise and generous legislation be extended
                                        to place Purdue University on a basis which would insure
                                        success and be but a just response to the liberality
                                        heretofore displayed by the General Government, and be an
                                        additional incentive to new donations from that
                                        source--while a vacillating or parsimonious policy would
                                        assuredly have the opposite effect.
                                   Your memorialists further believe there is no method better
                                        than liberal appropriations for education, by which life and
                                        property could be made more secure in our State, immigration
                                        encouraged, virtue strengthened, heavy expenditures for
                                        punishment or restraint of crime avoided; nor any policy
                                        other than that of fostering education in all its
                                        departments, whereby so much prosperity could be realized;
                                        so much development of mines and manufactures be effected;
                                        so much increase in our agricultural products be secured
                                        without deterioration of our rich soil; in short, by which
                                        Indiana could be made so enlightened and so worthy of her
                                        citizens.
                                   In conclusion, we respectfully beg leave to remind you that
                                        the especial object and purpose of the Purdue University is
                                        to foster and advance the Agricultural and Mechanical
                                        interests of the State.
