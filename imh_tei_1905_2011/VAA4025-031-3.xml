            <p>The Wilders gave soldiers to the three major wars of their country. The great-grandfather of General
                    Wilder, Seth Wilder, lost a leg in the battle of <geogName>Bunker Hill</geogName>, while the
                    grandfather, Seth Wilder, Jr., at the age of sixteen, served in the place of his disabled father and
                    participated in the Revolutionary War battles of Saratoga, Monmouth, and Stony Point. In the last
                    named engagement he was wounded by a bayonet-thrust of an enemy. In the War of 1812, the father,
                    Reuben Wilder, raised a company of light-horse and fought at Plattsburg and Sacket's
                    Harbor. He survived the Civil War, and when his son was at Murfreesboro preparing for the
                    approaching campaign, Reuben Wilder wrote his son from his home at Kingston, <placeName>

            <p>As a boy John T. Wilder received a fairly adequate education for that day, in the public schools of
                    his native county; but, restless by nature, he heard the call of the West and left home to try his
                    fortunes. He journeyed to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, arriving at the age of nineteen years,
                    practically penniless. For a time he was unable to get work,<hi rend="sup">3</hi> but at last
                    obtained employment as an apprentice in Ridgeway's Foundry which was located in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the west bank of the <geogName>Scioto River</geogName>, his duties being to aid as
                    draftsman, pattern-maker and in mill-wrightingâ€”labors that materially moulded his
                    after-career. Young Wilder showed such skill and industry that he was constantly promoted, until
                    finally Mr. Ridgeway offered to give the foundry to his son and Wilder, if together they would
                    operate it. Wilder having conceived a plan for his own future, declined the offer. He then removed
                    in 1857 to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, where he established, on a modest scale, a foundry and mill-wrighting
                    establishment of his own. Putting into the enterprise all his initiative and driving-power, it
                    bounded forward to a pronounced success.</p>
            <p>On May 18, 1858, Wilder was married to a young lady of great charm, Miss Martha Stewart, whose
                    father, Silas Stewart, had been one of the founders of the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Wilder as a young man is thus described by a kinswoman:
                    "He was a handsome young man, of fine physique, mentally alert, and fond of research in
                    nature. His genial and hospitable nature was equaled by that of his remarkable wife."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the time of the breaking out of the Civil War, the business of the Wilder establishment was
                    widespread. It sold equipment and erected mills and hydraulic works in Indiana, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>, <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>,
                            <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>. A turbine wheel, thrice patented by Wilder, was a main factor in this advance. By the
                    spring of 1861, the plant employed about one hundred men<hi rend="sup">6</hi> and its owner was
                    rapidly accumulating an estate of magnitude for that day. So proficient had Wilder become in the
                    field of hydraulics that he was recognized <list type="footnotes">

                            restaurant, he concluded that he would wait until he got hungrier before spending the coin,
                            so he walked away with it in his pocket; and he kept that coin in his pocket through all of
                            his eventful days." <placeName>

            <p rend="center">THE OUTBREAK OF CIVIL WAR</p>
            <p>Wilder's political alignment prior to the Civil War was with the Democratic party. When war
                    became an actuality, he promptly decided to support the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName> cause, and turned his attention to the casting of two six-pound cannon in his foundry
                    at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and to the organization (May, 1861) of a light artillery company for the first
                    three-year regiment recruited in Indiana. The artillery company, authorities decided, did not fit
                    into the plans and it was not accepted as such though the company was mustered into service as
                    Company "A" of the regiment, the Seventeenth Indiana Infantry, with Wilder as
                    captain. Within less than a month (June 4, 1861), he was promoted to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the
                    regiment, without having been a major. The regiment was organized at Camp Morton in May, 1861, and
                    mustered into service on July 12.</p>

                    the regiment aided in constructing Camp Pendleton. The regiment was then moved to Cheat Mountain
                    Pass on August 12, and afterwards went into camp at Elkwater. Under Brigadier-General J. J.

            <p>At Cheat Mountain, General Robert E. Lee's plan of battle was for a regiment of General H.

                    his own force on the enemy at Crouch's. The signal not being given, the plans went awry. On
                    the thirteenth of Septemper, Company E of the Seventeenth Indiana Regiment was sent to support the

                                    stronger I got. Our Regiment was ordered to open the fight by covering
                                    Loomis' Battery of six ten-pound cannon. I took the Regiment into the field
                                    within five-eighths of a mile of the enemy's batteries planted on an
                                    entrenched hill. I formed the men in line of battle across an open field, while the
                                    battery took position immediately in our rear. When the battery was ready to open I
                                    deployed the Regiment around and covered the battery on its right; and then such a
                                    roar of cannon! The first gun fired by the enemy threw a twelve pound ball directly
                                    over my head; the wind it made taking my cap off, but I caught it. The ball struck
                                    the earth within ten feet of General Reynolds who was in the rear.</p>
                        <p>After lying in the open field for an hour, we were ordered to go around the hill

                                    support Colonel Dumont. I formed the Regiment and told them that any man who was not
                                    willing to storm the enemy's batteries with me, and follow wherever I led
                                    the way, could fall out of ranks. But not a man stirred or spoke. I could see them

                                    Here I was ordered to halt and held the men for half an hour as steady as
                                    mile-posts, awaiting further orders, when I was ordered back. I immediately put the
                                    men back in perfect order and we were the only regiment of six that turned the point
                                    of the hill and came back in order. General Reynolds rode up to me as I came out
                                    into the open field and said, "yours is the only regiment in order. Can you
                                    cover those batteries and bring them off the field?" I said,
                                    "certainly, sir." I then deployed the Regiment across the open
                                    bottom between the batteries and the enemy, formed them in line and stood ready to
                                    repel any force that might attempt to cut off the batteries. The batteries then
                                    limbered up and retired. I followed and brought them safely into camp, having lost
                                    but one man. Our whole loss was ten killed and fifteen wounded. We killed
                                    thirty-eight of the enemy in driving them into their entrenchments and captured
                                    fourteen. â€¦ With our glasses we could see them hauling away their dead
                                    and wounded. They were re-enforced with four thousand men and six pieces of
                                    artillery. Their shells would burst in the midst of our men, knocking down a dozen
                                    men, but only scratching them; not more than one of their shells in ten burst, they
                                    forgetting to cut the fuses. One six-pound ball came between me and another officer
                                    as we were talking and stuck in the hillside; a cannon ball struck in the ground
                                    under Lieut. Shields' feet, but did not hurt him in the least. â€¦

                    colonel leading on horseback. Soon a skirt of woods was reached where an <hi rend="i">abattis</hi>
                    of felled beech trees had been so arranged as to prevent regimental formation. A gap had been left

            <p>Before the assault was begun, General Chalmers had sent in a demand for surrender, which was refused
                    by Wilder: "We'll try fighting for awhile." Two small detachments came in
                    during the day, reinforcing Wilder. One was under the command of Colonel C. L. Dunham, who being
                    Wilder's senior in rank, assumed command.</p>
            <p>Two days later another unsuccessful attack was made by the Confederates. In the afternoon Bragg with
                    his forces appeared before the fortifications and made a third demand for surrender, saying that the
                    garrison was surrounded by his entire army, and an assault would only result in a useless sacrifice
                    of life. Colonel Dunham decided that it was wise to comply; but he asked for time for consultation.
                    This Bragg agreed to grant until nine o'clock in the evening. Dunham wired the facts to
                    General C. C. Gilbert at <placeName>

                    Wilder marched out with the honors of war at daylight, retained their side-arms and private

                    in camp less than twenty miles away for two whole days, and permitted Wilder to be surrounded by
                    overwhelming numbers. One result of Buell's deliberate movements was the receipt of 4,000
                    paroled prisoners who were sent back to help consume the rather scanty supplies and embarrass our
                        advance."<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>Bragg, smarting under this resistance of his advance guard at Munfordsville, yielded to the

                    grist-mills that supplied forces of the Confederacy. Wilder preferred to construe the order of
                    General Rosecrans not to mean that mills should be burned or destroyed outright. So exercising his
                    skill in millwrighting he removed essential parts of the machinery and left the buildings intact.
                    One large mill only, operated by steam,<hi rend="sup">20</hi> in DeKalb County did he destroy. When
                    he reported to Rosecrans what he had done, he was told that he had disobeyed orders but would be

                    well be said that these elements were imparted to the Brigade by its leader. For quite a time it
                    built its own wagons, ironing them from the wrecks found along the roads; it shod its own horses;
                    and, when in a region that permitted, secured the coal for its forges. Each man carried a hatchet
                    with a handle two feet in length, handy in bivouac and in fighting, and at Murfreesboro (when
                    encamped there after the battle), for that reason, received the sobriquet of "The Hatchet
                        Brigade."<hi rend="sup">23</hi> The real official title was "The First Brigade
                    of the Fourth Division of the Fourteenth Corps," but, operating as an independent command
                    as it did, the name of Wilder was almost invariably given to it. It started out from Murfreesboro
                    toward Chattanooga, designated as the "First Mounted Rifles," only to receive,
                    because of the celerity of movement and its strong impact in attack, in the very first battle, the
                    appellation, "Wilder's Lightning Brigade." It was so named in the offical
                    reports of Confederate officers. This name stuck. The Brigade endeavored to, and did, live up to
                    that name. It may well be doubted whether in either army any single brigade was better known, or
                    bore so many marks of singularity.</p>

                    under a leader of dash and innate purposefulness. It is said that Wilder's old regiment
                    drew recruits from every county of Indiana, and that there was only a sprinkling of the foreign
                    element among them. This was measurably true of the <placeName>

                            the soldiers went to her widowed mother's home and, breaking bounds, took some

                            headquarters to complain in behalf of her mother. She was politely received and told by
                            Colonel Wilder that, except as to the horses and cattle, the men had not obeyed orders and

                            advantages of that repeating firearm, and that man was your old comrade, Col. John T.
                            Wilder, of Indiana, now of Chattanooga, Tennesee, who sits here by me, one of the happiest
                            soldiers attending this reunion. The regular army officers had been taught that the men
                            wasted much of their ammunition in battle. That was true, and so the regulars concluded that
                            a clumsy gun, difficult to load, was the best weapon; but that was not true. The position of
                            the regulars appeared to be logical; but Wilder's quick wit argued that if the
                            soldier could depend upon his weapon, and could know surely and certainly that when he fired
                            one shot that another was instantly ready, that soldier would hold his fire, and make every
                            shot count. History has demonstrated that troops armed with the <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Spencer</region>
                            </placeName> rifle, shooting eight shots as quickly as two could be fired from the <placeName>

                            </placeName> musket, actually expended less ammunition in battle than troops using muzzle
                            loaders, while doing thrice the execution. Wilder demonstrated that important fact; give him
                            the glory, for it is his.</p>
                        <p>Another thing he demonstrated was, the truth of the old saw that you must 'fight
                            fire with fire'; that is, if the enemy have long range guns, fight on foot, and
                            take advantage of trees, stumps, fences, ditches and barricades, you must fight him
                            dismounted, with long range guns, and take like advantage of trees, stumps, fences, ditches
                            and barricades. Wilder was no West Pointerâ€”fortunately for him and the country
                            that he was notâ€”for, if he had been, he would have had the same idea of cavalry
                            that the regulars hadâ€”that is that its heavy fighting must always be done in
                            heavy masses, at short range, and most dependence must be placed on the sabre. That was all
                            right on the plains of Europe, where there was opportunity for maneuvering heavy bodies of
                            cavalry, where the momentum of heavy cavalry columns charging en masse was difficult to meet
                            or break, but it amounted to nothing in a new <list type="footnotes">

                            ditches, stone fences, stumps and trees. The conditions of battle in this country were
                            entirely changed. Reason, common sense, logic, the highest military art and science,
                            demanded that the fighting should be changed to meet the new conditions. John T. Wilder was
                            the first, and, at first, the only soldier, volunteer or regular, who had the brains to take
                            in the situation, and the nerve to change the rules of battle to meet the changed condition
                            of the physical structure of the country where the fighting was to be done. He deserves for
                            that immortal glory and honor; and, in my opinion, in the end he will receive the honor and
                            glory that rightfully belong to him, and to him alone.</p>
                        <p>It is also an historical fact, undisputed and conceded, that until Wilder [no one] had
                            demonstrated that in this country, horses were only valuable as a means of transportation.
                            The cavalry arm of the military services of the <placeName>
                                <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                            </placeName> was the most ineffective and useless, and the most expensive arm of the
                            serviceâ€”useful it is true, as a scouting force, or flankers, as "the
                            eyes of the army,"â€”but in actual battle, cumbersome and worse than
                            useless. From the moment that Wilder demonstrated that men could be transported on
                            horse-back rapidly to the important point of military operations in the field and under
                            fire, and could be dismounted instantly and fight on foot with the coolness, steadiness, and
                            bravery of-the oldest and best drilled infantry, the cavalry of the army of the <placeName>

                            </placeName> was a byword. But after Wilder had demonstrated that important fact, then the

                            world, fighting his men dismounted, as Wilder had demonstrated was the true way to fight,
                            Sheridan redeemed the cavalry from disgrace, and covered himself with glory. The regulars
                            may not like to admit it, but when the true history of the war is written, the crown of
                            glory will rest on Wilder. We know it, my comrades, and we give him the glory now.</p>

            <p>After the battle of Murfreesboro, Rosecrans rested and recruited at that place, while Bragg withdrew
                    his army southward to Shelbyville and Tullahoma. A long ridge that divided the waters of the

                    the Confederates: Guy's Gap to the west through which ran the Murfreesboro-Shelbyville pike
                    and which was held by a portion of Polk's Corps; Liberty Gap, through which the road south
                    to Wartrace ran, was held by a part of Hardee's Corps; and Hoover's Gap, to the
                    east through which ran the Murfreesboro-<placeName>

                    </placeName> road, was defended by Stewart's Corps.</p>
            <p>Rosecrans, in moving against the enemy, planned to make <pb n="182" id="VAA4025-031-3-014"/> a feint
                    at penetrating the two western gaps, but in fact to carry Hoover's Gap. For the attack on
                    that Gap, he chose Thomas' Corps, with Reynold's Division in advance,
                    Wilder's Brigade as the spear-head. Rosecrans, in person, followed Thomas.</p>
            <p>Wilder's Brigade left Murfreesboro about four o'clock in the morning of June 24,
                    1863, under instructions from Reynolds to drive the enemy's pickets back into
                    Hoover's Gap and await the arrival of supporting infantry. Wilder to his surprise
                    encountered the resistance of only one brigade of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> cavalry, and decided to go, beyond his orders, through the Gapâ€”a long
                    canyon-like defileâ€”and seize its mouth on the south. His brigade, moving speedily
                    forward, the men now for the first time on their mounts, drove all contestants before it out of the
                    Gap. Reaching the southern extremity, the "long-roll" was heard sounding in the
                    Confederate camp two miles away. Brigadier-General W. B. Bate<hi rend="sup">25</hi> near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fairfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> village early in the afternoon learned of the danger that confronted the entire
                    Confederate army by this bold and unexpected "break-through," and sent up
                    re-enforcements.</p>
            <p>Wilder's task was to hold the Gap until Reynold's Infantry could come to his
                    support. His advance had pushed on two miles farther and captured seven supply wagons. These men
                    were called back and the entire Brigade placed in position on hillocks on either side of the
                    southern exit of the Gap. This gave the Federals the same defensive advantages that the Confederates
                    would have had in holding the northern entrance. Bate's brigade advanced against them, two
                    companies as skirmishers in double-quick time, the leader, the gallant Major Fred Claybrook, losing
                    his life at this time. The main forces of Bate and Rudler's Thirty-seventh <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> Regiment, giving the "rebel yell," engaged the Seventeenth Indiana
                    and the batteries of each side opened up a galling fire. The Federals gave way, but, seeing this,
                    Wilder rushed the Ninety-eighth <placeName>

                    report stated that there continued for nearly an hour "a bloody engagement" in
                    which "my command lost in killed and wounded nearly twenty-five percent of the number
                    engagedâ€”146 officers and men." The <list type="footnotes">

                    strength five to his one. It was not until the close of the "most spirited and sanguinary
                    conflict" (Bate), that Reynolds arrived with two brigades of infantry. About dark both
                    Wilder and Bate were relieved by fresh forces.</p>
            <p>The boldness and celerity of the movement of Wilder's Brigade in this action, as already
                    mentioned, caused it to be dubbed "Wilder's Lightning Brigade," General
                    Thomas expressing the opinion that the loss of one thousand men had been saved by the exploit. In
                    the event, by it Bragg was forced back from Shelbyville to Tullahoma in order to prevent being
                    flanked on his right by the Federals pouring through Hoover's Gap in Wilder's
                    wake. This battle was, without doubt, the most brilliant one in execution and results that the
                    Brigade ever fought single-handed.</p>
            <p>On June 28 the Federals, Wilder's Brigade again leading the advance, moved on <placeName>

                    Forty were captured. Four companies were sent under Wilder to destroy trestle work on the
                    McMinnville branch railroad. Their object was accomplished. The command then moved rapidly towards
                    Hillsborough.</p>
            <p>From Hillsborough, Confederate Colonel of cavalry George G. Dibrell<hi rend="sup">26</hi> hearing

                    railway, the water tank and depot filled with supplies. Wilder reported that, on the thirtieth of
                    June, "A large force was by this time approaching, and, having destroyed about three
                    hundred yards of track, we left, believing that I would have little success in a fight with them on

                    started in the direction of Pelham to intercept Wilder on the latter's return. It was
                    raining and Forrest and his escort (their identify concealed by their heavy, long oil-cloth coats)
                    were well in advance of the troops following. "Suddenly advancing toward a sharp turn in
                    the road, they met a detachment of mounted troops of about equal numbers and similarly clad in
                    non-committal water-proofs. The two companies were soon side by side in the highway, when Forrest
                    asked what company it was. The captain replied, naming a company in Wilder's mounted
                    infantry. Forrest cooly rejoined that his was Company C in a cavalry regiment, naming a Federal
                    division which was under another commander. Not suspecting the deceit, Wilder's men passed
                    them by in the road and went their way. The Confederate commander, feeling assured that the passing
                    company would soon collide with his troops, which he supposed were not more than a mile behind him,
                    determined to proceed only far enough to get out of sight of the company he had just passed, in
                    order to form his men across the way and intercept them when they should come back towards him in
                    retreat. Unfortunately, not a great distance ahead, as he advanced, he observed Wilder's
                    main column approaching. He then immediately and quickly turned back and soon ran into and through
                    the Federal advance he had some minutes before passed, capturing and killing a number of these and
                    causing a stampede among the rest. Before Forrest could reach his command and return to attack
                    Wilder, this wary leader had escaped, just getting ahead of Forrest, who, with nine regiments of
                    cavalry, aimed to intercept Wilder's force at Pelham."<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

            <p>Forrest was fired upon as he dashed away from Wilder's main command, and reported at once to
                    headquarters that the Federals were in force "with the evident purpose of turning the
                    Confederate right flank, which obliged General Bragg to resume his movement southward

            <p>Forrest went to Cowan, a station on the main line of the railroad, to cover the retreat of the
                    Confederate infantry over Cumberland Mountain. The Federal advance again appeared to press him and
                    came in contact with his rear-guard under General Forrest in person. Firing and falling back through
                    the village and towards a gap in the mountain, Forrest, near the rear, was berated by a woman from
                    the door of her cabin for not "turning on the Yankees and whipping them back."
                    Shaking her fist at General Forrest she shrieked: "You great big cowardly rascal; why
                    don't you turn and fight like a man, instead of running like a cur? I wish old Forrest was
                    here; he'd make you fight!" Forrest put spurs to his horse and fled from the

            <p>As Forrest's wagon-train was crossing Cumberland Mountain, a number of the natives collected
                    at a house on the roadside. They gazed in silence until the huge black-smith's forge
                    appeared in the rear, when an old woman's curiosity got the better of her, and she inquired
                    of Major Rambaut who happened to be passing: "What sort of a thing is that,
                    mister?" "That is a gunboat, madam," gravely replied the major.
                    "Lor, me," she said, "I never thought I'd live to see a gunboat

            <p>The Brigade advanced towards Chattanooga which was then but a small town held by General Bragg. A

                    of August, 1863. The four guns of Lilly's Battery were placed in position on
                    Stringer's Ridge overlooking the town across the river. Wilder started under a flag of
                    truce to the river's edge to demand a surrender of the town, and was fired upon by a
                    Confederate battery in Chattanooga. Two steam-boats<hi rend="sup">32</hi> were lying at the wharf

                    </placeName> Davis, President of the Confederate States, had recently visited Chattanooga and
                    appointed a day of prayer for August 21, and Rev. Dr. B. M. Palmer, one of the South's most
                    eminent divines, was holding services in the Presbyterian Church, which was filled with citizens and
                    army officers. An early shot from Lilly's Battery passed over the church. General B. F.
                    Cheatham arose in the gallery and said: "Do not be alarmed. It's our gunners
                    practicing. There's not a Yankee within fifty miles of here." Just then another
                    shot tipped the roof top, but the minister continued his already long prayerâ€”to Harry
                    Watterson, who was present, "the longest prayer I ever heard." For eighteen days
                    desultory firing was kept up, until Watterson's <hi rend="i">Chattanooga Rebel</hi> was
                    forced to leave for the further South, and the officers' headquarters were driven out of
                    the town, soon to be followed by Bragg's army.</p>

                    to do soâ€”and placed the Federal flag above the Crutchfield House, the town's
                    leading hotel.</p>
            <p rend="center">PRE-BATTLE MOVEMENTS</p>
            <p>When on September 9, it became known to the Federals that Bragg was evacuating Chattanooga,
                    Wilder's Brigade was sent up the <geogName>Tennessee River</geogName> to a point opposite a
                    small island, known as Friar's Island, and it became important to ascertain where the <placeName>

                    </placeName> could be forded. Wilder resorted to stratagem. Calling to Confederates on the opposite
                    bank, he proposed to exchange coffee for tobaccoâ€”two commodities of unfailing appeal.
                    This being assented to Wilder stripped himself to nudity, and waded out to the lower end of the
                    island, taking twenty-five pounds of coffee. He was met by a sergeant with two large plugs of
                    tobacco. Wilder wheedled the unsuspecting sergeant into giving the essential information, as to the
                    best fording place. Out of abundance of caution, he had the night before secretly placed a number of
                    sharpshooters on the island to protect him should there be <pb n="187" id="VAA4025-031-3-019"/> a

                    Brigade crossed at this ford, followed by Hazen's Brigade.</p>
            <p>Bragg's evacuation of Chattanooga had back of it a deeply conceived strategy: to draw the
                    Federal forces out of the town into a pursuit. He arranged that some of his men might be captured as
                    stragglers who should give information that their commander's plan was to fall back to
                    Rome, <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName> commander was misled, Wilder among them. The corps of McCook, Thomas and Crittenden
                    were sent out to intercept the retreating Confederates, and in so doing those corps became far
                    separated. A part of Bragg's design was, when this occurred, to strike and crush in detail.</p>
            <p>The main force of Bragg was at LaFayette, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, and that place Thomas was to attack. Crittenden had hurried to Ringgold, where on the
                    eleventh Wilder, as a part of his corps (shifted temporarily from that of Thomas), fought
                    Scott's brigade, capturing some prisoners.</p>
            <p>Forrest, seeing that a large number of Federal troops under Crittenden were separated from the main
                    army, planned their capture. He rode hurridly to Bragg's headquarters at midnight to
                    solicit aid, but Bragg had gone to LaFayette. Hastening back, Forrest, on September 11, placed his
                    command in front of the line of the Federals to prevent, if he could, their escape, but was himself
                    forced back by Wilder to <geogName>Tunnel Hill</geogName>. "Forrest led a charge at my
                    [Wilder's] advance-guard, but was repulsed and wounded in the back as he turned to flee

                    Wilder and his "Lightning Brigade"<hi rend="sup">42</hi> did signal service, from
                    the beginning to the very end of the battle. On orders from Rosecrans, he moved his Brigade to
                    Alexander's Bridge over <geogName>Chickamauga River</geogName>, a little over three miles
                    below Lee and Gordon's Mills (Crittenden's position) to resist the crossing of the
                    stream by the Confederates. At ten o'clock in the morning of September 18, a company of
                    infantry made the first attempt to cross, but was driven back. At noon Brigadier-General E. C.
                    Walthall, under orders from General Liddell, attacked in force, and a bitter struggle for
                    Alexander's Bridge ensued. The first assault was repulsed, but finally about mid-afternoon
                    the Confederates reached the bridge only to find that Wilder's men had torn up the plank
                    flooring and thrown it into the river.</p>
            <p>The Confederate report stated: "The force in our front consisted of Wilder's
                    Brigade, from whom we captured half a dozen or more breech-loading rifles. Our loss was 105, killed

                    ground though twice attacked during the night, seemingly by Gregg's Brigade of General

                    After midnight Wilder heard rumbling past his post wagon trains moving northwardâ€”Thomas
                    coming from McLemore's Cove to take his stand to prevent any effort of the Confederates to
                    reach Chattanooga. It was to the conduct of Wilder's Brigade in these early struggles on
                    the day and night of the eighteenth that General Thomas referred in his recommendation of Wilder for
                    promoiton to a brigadier-generalship: "For his ingenuity and fertility of resource in
                    occupying the attention of an entire corps while our army was getting around its flank."</p>
            <p>Wilder's Brigade viewing, on confrontation, the Confederate left since daylight, was shifted
                    to Davis' left and the whole line was soon in a desperate struggle with Bushrod
                    Johnson's Division and a part of Preston's. The lines ebbed and flowed as the
                    tide. In one of the Confederate advances near Viniard's, Wilder rushed forward two guns and
                    enfiladed the massed line with great slaughter. Johnson's line was forced to retire. At
                    sundown the day's conflict ended after raging throughout the afternoon "with an

                    and other commanders, and even Rosecrans, were now in disorder, then rout, hastening towards

                    "to get out of there." Assistant Secretary of War, Charles A. Dana gave the same
                    advice to Wilder, reporting Rosecrans as dead and "the army routed as badly, if not worse,
                    than the one at Bull Run." Dana begged that he, himself, be piloted into Chattanooga.</p>

                    nightfall placed his brigade in a line from a point near the Vidito house across the hills towards

                    Gap toward Chattanooga. Thomas well earned the sobriquet of "the Rock of

                    the Federals to enter the contest, at Alexander's Bridge, he was last to leave the field

                    Sheridan told me just after the battle of Chickamauga that he would rather have Wilder's

                            in heaps; the dry grass and stubble caught fire which lapped around the slain and wounded.

                    Rosecrans later said: "The river was opened and the army was saved and supplied with bread.
                    The remarks of the soldiers that they could defend that line if I would open the cracker line were

                    about three months, the disease at one time threatening to become fatal. He was left subject to
                    recurrences of a stubborn diarrhea which broke the continuity of his service on campaign and finally
                    caused his retirement on October 5, 1864, at a time when his star was in the ascendant.</p>
            <p>The qualities and methods of Wilder as a commander may not unfittingly be compared to those of
                    Forrest with whom he so frequently came in contact. Both were marked by initiative and daring and by
                    a fertility in a sort of strategy that was not manifested by West Pointers. Neither was handicapped
                    by a training that held one to that which was the recognized or usual. The soldiers under both
                    leaders rode as cavalry but customarily fought as infantry. It is not improbable that the success of
                    Forest had no little to do with Wilder's insistence upon mounting the men of his Brigade.
                    That Wilder measured up to Forrest is not contended; his recurrent absences from his command on
                    account of illness, no doubt, prevented his nearer approach to the measure of the "Knight

                    was struck with the advantages afforded by the county of Roane. He visited Col. Robert K. Byrd,
                    alongside whom he had fought, who owned the farm where the city of Harriman now stands. Byrd urged
                    upon Wilder the desirable features of that location as a town site. Looking over the farm with Byrd,
                    Wilder asked: "Colonel, what about the <geogName>Emory River</geogName>. Won't it
                    flood these bottoms?" Byrd made a reply that might be construed to be a negation. In a

                    "Bob, what devilish boys put that log up that tree?" "Oh, let's
                    go to the house and eat dinner," closed the incident, and another site was chosen. This was

                    about four feet in thickness. A quarter of a mile from this vein was found coal well suited for
                    coking and iron-making, and lime-stone for fluxing was immediately at hand.</p>
            <p>A company, styled Roane Iron Company, was organized in 1867 by Wilder and two associates, Maj. W. A.
                    Rockwood and Capt. H. S. Chamberlain, and the town of Rockwood was laid out and given the name of
                    Major Rockwood. A blast furnace was erected between the deposits of iron and coalâ€”the
                    first using coke to be operated in the South. Soon a second furnace was erected, and ever thereafter
                    Wilder's primacy as an industrialist was freely acknowledged by Tennesseeans. The next
                    enterprise was the establishment of the Roane Rolling Mills at Chattanooga for the manufacture of
                    rails for railroads, the two operations being connected by water transport, first by barges and then
                    by steamboats on the <geogName>Tennessee River</geogName>. These and other enterprises projected by
                    General Wilder went far towards fixing the fate of Chattanooga as the industrial center of the
                    Central South. In the fast developing city he erected Wilder's Machine Works, where, among
                    other articles, was manufactured Wilder's turbine wheel, an invention of the General that
                    was widely marketed; the Southern Car and Foundry Company; and, at near by <placeName>

                    </placeName> Coal and Iron Company. Later followed the Durham Coal Company which operated on
                    deposits of <pb n="199" id="VAA4025-031-3-031"/> coal near the battlefield of Chickamauga. In the
                    meantime the General had served as <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1876.</p>
            <p>Wilder's farsightedness and enthusiasm marked him as a dependable promoter. He removed from
                    Chattanooga to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson</region>

                    </placeName> Railroad which was soon placed under construction, the intended northern terminus being

            <p>At <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson</region>
                    </placeName> City, General Wilder organized the Carnegie Land Company, erected a large blast
                    furnace, a fine hotel and an office building. He had previously purchased a large boundary of
                    magnetic iron ore lands in western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>, and built on Roan Mountain (6,313 feet altitude) Cloudland Hotelâ€”at the
                    time the highest habitation east of the Rocky Mountainsâ€”a resort for those seeking
                    immunity from hay-fever. The General's last enterprise was entered upon after he had passed
                    the age of seventy-five years, the Fentress Coal Company on the Cumberland Mountain Plateau where
                    stands the mining town, Wilder.</p>
            <p>Wilder foresaw the development of the Tennessee's water power. Anticipating the
                        <geogName>Tennessee Valley</geogName> Authority by more than two decades, he led in the
                    organization of a power company and the acquisition of water-rights along the Little
                        <geogName>Tennessee River</geogName>. In this instance, as in some others, he but manifested the
                    vision of a seer and pioneer. Others, rather than himself, profited in later years from a prescience
                    that can only be termed remarkable. There was more than a dash of optimism in his makeup which
                    tended at times to blind him to hazards.</p>
            <p>As to personal appearance: General Wilder was six feet <pb n="200" id="VAA4025-031-3-032"/> two
                    inches in height, but well proportioned. As age advanced he took on flesh but until after eighty
                    years he moved with ease and a degree of grace. His eyes were particularly penetrating and bright;
                    they were readily kindled by merriment. He had unusual conversational powers; his speech was spicy
                    and at times emphasis was attempted to be lent by strong and explosive words, after the manner of
                    many military men. His information was wide and in some directions ample, such as in the field of
                    the history and traditions of the regions in which he resided, and in reminiscences of the great and
                    near-great with whom he had come in contact. He was a total abstainer from intoxicants and made no
                    use of tobacco; but at the board he was no mean trencherman, especially when confronting a juicy
                    beefsteak.</p>
            <p>While always interested in public affairs, General Wilder seldom aspired to elective office. He was
                    elected Mayor of Chattanooga in 1871, but resigned when his term had run but eight months. In 1876
                    he was put forward by the Republicans as their candidate for Congress from the Chattanooga district,
                    and though he cut a large adverse majority to a very narrow one, he failed of election. He had not
                    the arts of the politician; his positive character and forthrightness prevented his being such. He
                    served a term as postmaster at Chattanooga, being appointed November 15, 1877, and gave satisfaction
                    to patrons of all party alignments.</p>
            <p>General Wilder suffered grievous losses in the Baring Brothers panic of 1893, and in 1897 was glad to
                    accept appointment from President McKinley to the pension agency at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Knoxville</settlement>
                    </placeName> through which flowed to the nation's pensioners in the South multiplied
                    thousands of dollars each pay day. Asking for his appointment to that place, was General and
                    ex-President Benjamin Harrison who had been done a great favor by Wilder in May, 1878, which was of
                    too intimate a nature for recital here. He was twice re-appointed, once by President Theodore
                    Roosevelt and again by President Taft.</p>
            <p>Yet later, General Wilder was honored by appointment as a member of the Chickamauga National Park
                    Commission, of which he became chairman. No fitter man could have been found, having in view his
                    part in the great battle fought there and his natural adaptability to the task of marking and caring
                    for the large acreage dedicated by the Nation to the achievements <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-031-3-033"/>

            <p>In 1904 General Wilder married Miss Dora E. Lee, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>, whose father was a captain in the Confederate army and a scion of the great Lee family

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>A pronounced feature of the General's life after the Civil War was his popularity among the
                    ex-Confederates and Southerners. Between them and him was a sort of affinity, as he often remarked.</p>
            <p>Perhaps no incident in Wilder's post-war career so marks the man as his intervention to
                    prevent the arrest and prosecution of General Nathan <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName> Forrest when the latter was charged with breaking the terms of his parole on surrender
                    in 1865 by taking part in the operations of the original Ku Klux Klan. On learning of the steps
                    being taken against Forrest, Wilder visited Forrest in Memphis to get from him his own statement as
                    to his motives and attitude. Convinced that Forrest had sincerely headed the Klan for the protection
                    and betterment of his people, Wilder went to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> and prevailed upon President Grant to see that no arrest should be made of the great
                    Southern leader. There can be little doubt that Grant was easily persuaded, though Wilder had
                    enlisted the aid of Senators Oliver P. Morton and John A. Logan and Richard J. Oglesby. General and
                    Mrs. Forrest paid a return visit of a week to the Wilders in their home on the terrace in
                    Chattanooga. Many a story of the war must then have been told!</p>
            <p>The funeral sermon of General Wilder was preached by the ex-Confederate soldier, Rev. Dr. John W.
                    Bachman, for fifty years pastor of the Presbyterian church in Chattanooga, in which reference was
                    feelingly made to this incident, and as one proving the high mutual regard that existed between
                    Wilder and Southerners.</p>
            <p>The esteem in which General Wilder was held as a citizen was well expressed in a tribute by one who
                    knew him long and well, Adolph S. Ochs, of the <hi rend="i">Chattanooga Times</hi> and the great <hi rend="i">

            <p>One day in the spring of 1817, a farmer stood in the door-yard of his Indiana home looking out over
                    his clearing. Only the Christmas before, he and his family had eaten their first dinner in their new
                    log cabin and he was now busily making plans for the futureâ€”plans, one might assume for
                    the material comfort of his family, but, since he was of Welsh descent, this probably included
                    religious and educational opportunities for his family. As he stood thus, his attention was
                    attracted by the sound of moving horses followed by the appearance of six riders. The strangers had
                    much to do to keep from being brushed from their horses by the low branches of the heavy forest
                    trees. They rode up to the settler, and, after the customary greetings, one of them stated their
                    errandâ€”to ask permission to hold religious services on the north-west corner of his farm.
                    To this the settler replied: "If it is for religious services, you may use every corner of
                    my farm."</p>
            <p>Among the visitors who made this request were William Lock and William Turner. Soon meetings were
                    held in the homes of the neighborhood and thus was started the Long Run Baptist Church, an
                    organization that has had an uplifting influence on the community and that has sent into other
                    communities young men and women of solid worth. The formal organization of this church was effected
                    in 1818 with seven of the following as constituent members: Thomas and Nancy Wright, Joel and Ellen
                    Higgins, Nathaniel and Susan Girard, William J. and Catherine Griffith, William and Nancy Lock. This
                    was the first group of any denomination to build a church in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> County which has had a continuous existence.</p>
            <p>The first building was erected on ground given by William J. Griffith. Roads at that time were little
                    more than trails, but the site was in Craig Township, <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> County, about seven miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The church was on what was afterwards known as the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Moorefield <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName>, now state road 129. The building was a log structure with a gallery across one end. At
                    the various services, this gallery was appropriated by young lads in their teens, and thereby hangs
                    a tale.</p>
            <pb n="205" id="VAA4025-031-3-037"/>
            <p>Here is the story as told to the writer by one present: When young enough to occupy the family pew
                    with his parents, the boy most concerned would gaze longingly at the larger boys in the gallery who
                    seemed of great importance. Then came a proud Sunday when the youngster gained a reluctant consent
                    from his father to take his place among these larger boys. During the service there were audible
                    titters to be heard from this direction, but the older people who craned their necks to detect the
                    cause of the disturbance, could see only the bright, beaming faces of the lads behind the protecting
                    rail. However, the newest occupant of the gallery when questioned at home said that one of the
                    larger boys had dared two of the smaller boys to swap pantaloons with one another. The dare was
                    taken and the exchange of garments was made then and there. The immediate result was that next
                    church-day, the latest gallery recruit again sat in the family pew.</p>
            <p>Pastors serving this church were: Elder John Pavy, Elder Jessie Miles, Elder Henry D. Banta, Elder
                    Daniel Palmer, the Rev. Johnnie Graham, and the Rev. Archie Smith. The writer remembers hearing in
                    her childhood the older people still speaking affectionately of Johnnie Graham and Archie Smith. The
                    services held in this church were undoubtedly marked by a zealous spirit while the sermons were
                    replete with doctrine.</p>
            <p>In the year 1843, the congregation, grown stronger numerically, erected a new brick building across
                    the road from the old church on ground given by a good Methodist friend, Mr. John F. Cotton.
                    Henceforth, the ground occupied by the older church together with additional ground given by the
                    Rev. Joshua D. Griffith was used for a cemetery. The second building was of ample size to hold the
                    large congregations which gathered on every "meeting" day, and while plain it had
                    a kind of solid dignity. Beginning in 1843, the Rev. Griffith served as pastor of the Church for
                    forty-five consecutive years. He later served about five years more in this capacity in the present
                    building.</p>
            <p>A typical "meeting day" was described by one of the older members. Standing in the
                    yard of the Church, he saw the faithful gathering from all directions. There came the horse-back
                    riders, young blood these, among whom were to be seen young women with long flowing skirts who rode
                    up <pb n="206" id="VAA4025-031-3-038"/> to the stile-block and dismounted, each with the assistance
                    of one of the young gallants. There is a legend to the effect that on one occasion, a young lady,
                    who had riden a mare, followed by its foal, undertook to dismount before she reached the stile in
                    order to avoid the help of an unwelcome swain awaiting her. Unfortunately, as she sprang from her
                    mount, the colt ran under her and trotted away with her astride its back making its way through the
                    crowd. It is unreasonable to imagine that the flouted youth tried to suppress his grins at her
                    discomfiture. Families came in wagons containing chairs for the elder members and a liberal amount
                    of straw sprinkled on the bottom of the wagon bed for the younger ones. Back of these walked a merry
                    group of boys and girls who lived only comparatively short distances away. Here and there were
                    "shoo-fly" buggies carrying young couples, or perhaps a single man, older or
                    younger, who hoped that some young lady would permit him to "see her home." Along
                    one road there came one or two families in spring-wagons. These vehicles were new and considered
                    very "smart" at that time, but one had scarcely time to remark their beauty, till
                    his attention was distracted by the arrival of two equipages that merit special mention. These were
                    the carriages of Harry Rogers and David Blunk which were very handsome and
                    expensiveâ€”reputed to have cost six or seven hundred dollars each. Roads were often bad
                    and travel slow, but it was an invariable custom to whip up when in sight of the church and arrive
                    in a blaze of glory.</p>
            <p>After pausing to chat with each other for a while, the women and some of the older men entered the
                    church, the women passing to the left and occupying the seats on that side of the building. Many of
                    the younger matrons carried babies dressed in very long and very elaborately tucked and embroidered
                    dresses. One of the writer's sisters still speaks of a dress worn by Dr. Augustus Hatton
                    when an infant. If her memory serves her correctly, the garment surpassed all others in length and
                    beauty. The mothers were followed by the children of the family, to the more responsible of whom was
                    entrusted the inevitable black basket filled with apples, cookies, a bottle of water and other
                    necessaries.</p>
            <p>The songs were started by means of a tuning-fork in the hands of a song-leader. An early leader was
                    John Leap. Much later this office fell to John G. Sigmon. The singing <pb n="207" id="VAA4025-031-3-039"/> of the first song was, the signal for the young men to enter the
                    church, which they did with proper decorum and seated themselves behind the older men on the right
                    of the room. When the services were at night, many of the young men as they walked down the aisle,
                    carried with them their buggy-whips for it was whispered that there were some wild young fellows
                    from adjoining neighborhoods who were not above stealing these articlesâ€”a crime which has
                    died out with the coming of automobiles.</p>
            <p>After the usual opening of the service with Scripture reading and prayer, the minister began his
                    sermon. His style was quiet and persuasive, as far removed from the sing-song delivery ascribed to
                    pioneer ministers as it was from the bombastic oratory of the succeeding generation. The sermon,
                    logical and showing familiarity with the scriptures, may have been a trifle long, but there were
                    those in the congregation who listened eagerly to the end.</p>
            <p>Until 1849 the church was a member of the Laughery Association, and in the minutes of this body are
                    found the names of the following people who were sent as delegates at various times from 1822 to
                    1849 to represent the Long Run Baptist Church in the councils of the embracing organization: William
                    Lock, Nathaniel Girard, Thomas Wright, Joel Higgins, William Turner, Wilson Crandell, John Sigmon,
                    J. Hockensmith, I. Hockensmith, O. Hockensworth, John Graham, William J. Griffith, E. Herrick,
                    William Hannis, Steven Rogers, William Lewis, J. Stickman, B. Edwards, N. Ritten-house, J. D.
                    Griffith, B. Cole, A. Hankins, Henry Rogers, Samuel Lock, Thomas Sigmon, David H. Todd, John Leap
                    and John Orr.</p>
            <p>During these years, a question arose as to whether the churches in this Association should cease
                    correspondence with the churches in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, on account of the attitude of the latter churches on the question of slavery. The
                    decision reached was that although the Laughery Association had no fellowship with slavery, its
                    churches should continue correspondence with the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> churches as the members of these churches were godly men. However this problem seemed
                    still to rankle in the minds of some of the brethern, for at a meeting a few years later this query
                    was made: "Is it in good order to invite to our communion, the members <pb n="208" id="VAA4025-031-3-040"/> of those churches that refuse to correspond with us on account of our
                    correspondence with the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> Association?"</p>
            <p>Another subject of doubt is revealed in this decision handed down by the Association:
                    "Although we as a denomination believe that much good has been done by the various
                    institutions called benevolentâ€”such as Sunday Schools, Bible Societies, Missions, etc.,
                    yet in many places there are different opinions among us on these subjects; we, therefore recommend
                    to all our churches and brethern to allow liberty to conscience on all subjects and not allow them
                    to break our fellowship."</p>
            <p>On September 1, 1849, a letter of dismissal was granted to the Long Run Baptist Church from the
                    Laughery Association. This group comprised all of the Baptist Churches in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> County with some others from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson</region>
                    </placeName> County.</p>
            <p>The annual meeting of this Association was to any church that entertained the delegates an event long
                    to be remembered. The earlier meetings were three days in length and were attended by the membership
                    of the local church, delegates and interested members from other churches, and by the Baptist State
                    Officersâ€”many of them men of reputation and strength. The feeding of this throng required
                    several days of preparation. The author can well remember the delightful feeling of excitement and
                    upheaval in her own family when Long Run Church entertained this body. Her mother, a woman of not
                    inconsiderable skill as a housewife, was taxed to the limit to meet the unusual demand. In her
                    preparations she was ably assisted by the writer's older sisters. Great quantities of beef
                    were roasted, chickens fried, pies and cakes baked and recipes searched out for the making of choice
                    jellies, pickles and preserves. Did this food go a-begging? Not a bit of it, as on occasion the
                    family had as many as forty guests at one time.</p>
            <p>At night those delegates living closest to the community went home, to return next day, but even so
                    there remained many to be sheltered. At such times the writer's brothers would help to ease
                    the situation by going to the barn to sleep in the hay, while the girls in the family had their own
                    method of contriving extra beds. Our mother must have felt weary after these occasions, but she
                    always had a welcome left for the next time.</p>
            <pb n="209" id="VAA4025-031-3-041"/>
            <p>The first Sabbath School of the Church was held on a beautiful spring morning, the first Sunday in
                    May of 1861 or 1862. The writer's sister Carrie claims the proud distinction of being the
                    first to arrive. She and her brother Tom (Dr. Thomas J. Griffith) are probably the only people of
                    all those present that morning, who are still living.</p>
            <p>At that time there was no organ in the church but a number of the mature people were good singers,
                    some having learned to sing from the old <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Harmony. In the year 1867, Harry Girard taught a singing school at the church and this
                    gave a great impetus in the realm of music. Mr. Enoch Adams who had a beautiful tenor voice also
                    taught a singing school at the church. Favorite songs were: "I Think when I Read the Sweet
                    Story of Old"; "I'll Away to the Sunday School";
                    "I'm Trying to Climb up <geogName>Zion's Hill"</geogName>.
                    Sometimes when the last song was started by a high soprano voice without the aid of a tuning-fork,
                    the men of the congregation were left struggling at the foot of the hill while the women swarmed
                    over the top.</p>
            <p>Each summer the members of the Sabbath School were asked to "march" in the
                    procession of the Moorefield (Ebenezer Methodist Episcopal Church) Celebration. In the year 1868,
                    the Long Run Sabbath School paid $35 for a handsome new banner in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> to carry in this procession. The banner was made of white satin trimmed in gilt fringe.
                    On it was this inscription: "In God We Trust" and "We Honor Robert
                    Raikes". Hannah Crandell and Stella Griffith were the streamer carriers. They wore white
                    organdy dresses with five tucks in the skirt of each. The sashes were scarlet. The School bought
                    wreaths with green and white predominating. The song for the occasion, "Jesus the Water of
                    Life will Give", was taught to the school by Ann Marie Griffith, a talented pupil of the
                    Indiana School for the Blind.</p>
            <p>Protracted meetings of several weeks were held each year at which time a visiting minister was called
                    in to assist the resident pastor. Some of these ministers were men of power. The impressions made by
                    such men as Robert Stevenson, Louis Salin, a converted Jew, Albert Ogle, W. Y. Monroe, Judson
                    Willett and P. O. Duncan will long remain.</p>
            <p>The ministers serving as pastors of the Long Run Church from 1843 to 1912 were the following reverend
                    gentlemen: <pb n="210" id="VAA4025-031-3-042"/> J. D. Griffith, Robert Stevenson (who exchanged
                    pulpits with Mr. Griffith for one year), William E. Morris, J. J. Willett, George
                    Jain,â€”Faris, Chesley Holmes, Frank Jones,â€”<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson</region>
                    </placeName> and Thomas Seburn. The Sunday School superintendents who served were: Jimmie Ward, an
                    Englishman, Andrew Sigmon, Anna Stewart, Mattie Bersot, Irvin Roberts, Armington Culver, Hannah
                    Scott, and various members of the Brown and Crandell families.</p>
            <p>A time arrived when some of the younger and more daring members allowed a desire for an organ to
                    creep into their minds, not willingly at first, because the wish for an organ was a vanity to be
                    supressed. But with each return of the idea, the urge became more insistent and the feeling grew
                    that a plan to this end might not be impossible to carry out. When the subject was broached to the
                    more conservative element of the congregation, there was found to be suprisingly little objection to
                    it. So in good time an organ was purchased and the writer became the first organist, having been
                    exalted to this office, she verily believes, by her own father and mother. As for her part, she
                    played conscientiously if not skillfully and finished each stanza not too far behind the singers.
                    Other young women who succeeded to this position were: Afra Hatton, Hattie Taylor, Pearl Brindley,
                    Lillie Cooper and Maud Crandell.</p>
            <p>The third church building occupied by this congregation was erected about 1894 on the lot where the
                    second church had stood. This structure still stands. It is an attractive brick building of ample
                    size to seat comfortably the large congregation made up of the families of the thrifty farmers who
                    attended the services.</p>
            <p>There can be found in this congregation persons who are better fitted than the author to write the
                    history of the Church from 1912 to the present. However, the writer knows that in this community as
                    elsewhere, changes extraordinary have taken place since the days of the two older churches. Gone are
                    the old ways of travel and with them have disappeared the long riding skirt, the side-saddle, and
                    the stile-block. Gone too, is the procession of young men carrying buggy-whips. The new church has
                    no central aisle so that it easily came about that the separation of men and women in the church was
                    discontinued. If one should pass <pb n="211" id="VAA4025-031-3-043"/> this church on a fair Sunday
                    morning, he would see a few dozen cars, some of them probably very handsome but none more
                    distinctive for this generation than were the Blunk and Rogers carriages of the sixties.</p>
            <p>When last the writer worshipped in the Long Run Church, there were some new families who had
                    affiliated with the organization, among them the Hickmans. Nevertheless, a large part of the
                    membership consisted of the descendants of the founders and early members of the church. Others have
                    gone from this congregation to become well known in the profession: education, law, medicine,
                    engineering, etc. The men who became famous included an engineer, whose work called him to three
                    continents, a statesman, and a most distinguished advocate of the city manager form of municipal
                    government.</p>
            <p>It is of the second church that the writer thinks most often. She recalls the odor that greeted her
                    on entering the building. Later experience tells her that this was a musty odor peculiar to rooms
                    and buildings that have been closed a great deal. However, to her youthful fancy, it was an odor at
                    once mystical and elegantâ€”mystical because it was associated with her highest thoughts,
                    but elegant too, for was it not also associated with Sunday garments? She imagines the people coming
                    into the church, stepping up on the door sill, and then, because the floor was somewhat sunken,
                    stepping down into the room. She pictures the families in their pews: Frank Stewart and wife in
                    their pew with their pink-cheeked, immaculately clean children; positive John Crandell and his
                    beautiful wife, who would have graced any company; Augustus Hatton, Sr., a hospitable little man
                    fond of his jest with Mrs. Hatton, his wife, but grave, intellectual and possessed of astuteness in
                    financial matters; musical John G. Sigmon, his modest wife and musical children; Mrs. Cowan (who
                    reminded one of Queen Victoria) and her prosperous descendants. Besides these there were the John
                    Todds, the Albert Brindleys, the C. W. Browns, the John Browns, and the James Crandells. Then there
                    were the families of Josuha Coleman, John and Henry Lock, Keziah Hannis, Irvin and Evaline Tilley,
                    and various branches of the Leap, Taylor, Reed, Orr, Worstell, Clements and Cooper families. There
                    were also some of the MacKenzies one of <pb n="212" id="VAA4025-031-3-044"/> whom is associated with
                    bag-pipe playing, which accomplishment always seemed to give tone to the whole community.</p>
            <p>All these the writer loves to remember, for, as she recalls the faces of the women, some beautiful
                    and some plain, and of the men, rugged and kindly, she feels that they have the look of those who
                    have built soundlyâ€”of those who "know on whom they have believed". Such
                    a memory is a valued possession, for out of it grows strength and courage.</p>

            <p>There have been few important men in American history whose opinions and warnings, if followed, could
                    have been so beneficial to the nation as those of Walter Q. Gresham. Unfortunately he lived during a
                    period that was swayed by war feelings, petty partisanship, and rapidly expanding business. His
                    ideas were not attractive because they were not in harmony with the prevailing thought of the
                    moulders of public opinion of that time. His entire record as Secretary of State shows a devotion to
                    principle that was exceedingly rare for the last decade of the last century.</p>
            <p>The works covering that period in general, and Gresham in particular, fail to set forth many
                    incidents that help to explain why he left so little lasting imprint upon our foreign policy. Most
                    of the writers on the period have overlooked the fact that Gresham evidently believed that events
                    and circumstances work through the individual. Again, and more worthy of notice, he was more
                    concerned and conversant with American economic and social problems than with those of diplomacy. In
                    fact, he considered the greatest question of the age to be the relations between capital and
                        labor.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Phases of this problem were to color nearly all of his diplomacy and

                    Gresham had reflected long, that caused him to accept a place in the official family of President

            <p>With a determining background of that nature, and a well defined panic pending, Gresham assumed his

                    interested in the Nicaragua venture. "I have just received a telegram from Minister Baker
                    saying that he can do nothing in the canal matter without the assistance of an able lawyer who
                    understands the Spanish language and practice; that matters are in the worst possible shape; that
                    the canal property has been virtually confiscated and the concession attacked."<hi rend="sup">15</hi> In December, 1894, he confided to Bayard his fear that a canal bill would

                    </placeName> the part Admiral Walker played has received scant notice. Among the earliest references
                    to the officer's presence in Honolulu, was a communication of Gresham to Albert S. Willis,
                    our minister there, in which the Secretary wrote: "Admiral Walker's letter to the
                    Secretary of the Navy deals mainly with the political situation in the Islands. He does not seem to
                    realize that you represent the Government in such matters. The Admiral evidently sympathizes
                    strongly with the Provisional Government and favors annexation.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The following statements from the correspondence between Willis and Gresham
                    undoubtedly exerted upon the latter an influence which made for opposition to annexation. Admiral
                    Walker asked for, and obtained, permission to land troops for exercise. "He did not correct
                    the impression he [Walker] was here to spy on the British Minister. He told the British Captain he
                    [Walker] could take care of all interests here and that his assistance was unnecessary."
                    Walker gave a dinner to Mr. Dole, head of the Provisional Government, and Mrs. Dole on board his
                    ship, but Willis and his wife were not invited probably because the Admiral had asked if they would
                    come if invited and had been told no. Willis made the following statement relative to Walker: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I received your last private letter in which you refer to the political character of letters

                            desired, make known to him the fact that I was informed as to such correspondence and to say
                            to him that the State Department looked to me for information as to political conditions
                            here. The Admiral, while maintaining profound reticence as to his
                            'mission', has several times referred to 'conversations'
                            with the President which he had before leaving, without indicating their nature.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>Later, Gresham declared: "I was opposed to Admiral Walker going to Honolulu and it is plain

                    "Admiral Walker has exaggerated many trivial things. I did not detain him two days. There
                    is nothing especially threatening now nor when Walker was here".<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Possessing this information from Willis, Gresham pondered over the reasons for all the furor about
                    Hawaiian affairs. His thoughts are revealed in a letter to Senator Roger Q Mills: "The
                    entire population of the Islands, including natives and foreigners, is less than 100,000. It is safe
                    to say that the revenues collected do not defray the expenses of the present Government. How is it
                    being supported? Where did the funds come from? Certain Republican Senators are very intimate with
                    Thurston, the Hawaiian Minister. Would it not be well to ask them for information on this
                        point?"<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>The Democratic leader who received this letter read an article which Lodge and Frye said charged them
                    with buying Hawaiian bonds at twenty-five cents and wanting annexation to sell them at par.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> To the Secretary of State, the affair was closely identified with tariff
                    maneuvering. The delay in enacting a low tariff had been caused by a number of so-called Democratic
                    Senators, who were in fact strong protectionists. Gresham asserted: Some of them have been
                    speculating in sugar stock, and discounting what we hear, <list type="footnotes">

                    Cleveland's predecessorâ€”this mere clash of personalities is no sufficient
                    explanation. In 1875 Gresham had criticized Harrison for the lengths to which the latter would go in
                    order to win a verdict.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> In 1888, that animosity had a chance to increase, for
                    Foster asserted in a letter to Gresham: "I find that the Indiana syndicate has been very
                    active in interviewing and writing to prominent men here and elsewhere. I hear of them everywhere.
                    Dudley, however, told Lynch positively that the delegation would go for you if there was no chance

                    president that aroused Gresham and made him waver in his party allegiance, but the fact that the
                    Republican leaders wrote a protective tariff plank into their platform in 1888.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Gresham right principles and uniform justice amounted to more than personal feelings. The

                    date. He wrote: "We have gone too far in protecting special interests. If men can be
                    protected by tariff against foreign competition and by trusts against home competition, they can do
                    about as they please." Anticipating technocracy, the late Senator Long, Father Coughlin,
                    Stuart Chase and others, Gresham reflected on the necessity of modifying the economic system: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            oppressed. They are growing stronger daily, and unless capital yields, we will have
                            collisions more serious than the one which occurred at Homestead. The right to acquire and
                            hold property must be recognized. No civilization of the past has amounted to anything that
                            did not recognize that right. But those who employ labor seem to think that only property
                            rights need protection, and that laborers are entitled to no more sympathy and consideration
                            than the machinery which they attend. Employers go through their forms of worship in a
                            perfunctory way, not heeding the injunction that we should love our neighbors as ourselves.
                            It seems to me that labor will triumph in the near future, but will it use its power
                                wisely?<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

            <p>Why did those words go unheeded? First, they had practically no circulation. Although Gresham was
                    widely known, his opinions were revealed to a relatively small number of friends. Second, he was an
                    ex-Republican or an independent Republican serving in a Democratic Cabinet in a time when principles
                    were often regarded as of less importance than party. Hence he was viewed with suspicion by the
                    stalwarts of both parties, and therefore by the general fry. Third, as Secretary of State he had
                    little to do directly with domestic problems. To have given him more influence in home affairs, the
                    post of Attorney General would have been more suitable, but it would have separated him from the
                    tariff controversy. Fourth, he was antagonistic to, and opposed by the very power which was soon to
                    have much greater influence in the nationâ€”the money power. Fifth and last, his premature
                    death in 1895, at the age of sixty-three, removed a man who could have rendered valuable assistance
                    to the reform movement of the first decade of the present century.</p>

            <p>Morris Birkbeck was an Englishman, who made the best of his opportunities in America. The name,
                        Birkbeck,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> belongs to "an old established family of distinction,
                    the first occurrence of the name being in 1318". It was in 1817, that Morris Birkbeck of
                    near Guilford, Surrey County, <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, led a number of English emigrants from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> to southeastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and southwestern Indiana. Having disposed of his large holdings in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> for some $55,000, he came to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and established a group of settlers on a site, formerly known as Wanborough, about two
                    miles from the present town of Albion, Edwards County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. He organized a model town in five-acre tracts, but the village has been almost
                    forgotten. However, he and George Flower spent a fortune of something like $100,000 to
                    establish for their English friends a settlement where they not only could have the advantage of
                    cheap lands, unburdened from taxation, but an opportunity to dwell in a new land free from
                    aristocracy where no established religion prevailed.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>According to his descendants, he was an only son of a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> preacher. He had received the advantages of a good education, and especially was he
                    schooled in Latin and Greek. Traveling extensively in Europe and America, he wrote some important
                    sketches which are valuable to students doing research in early nineteenth century history.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> His writings attracted the attention of men like Thomas Jefferson and Marquis

                    </placeName>, as well as English emigrants. Again, his anti-slavery writings were considered

                    anything they had ever witnessed in their home country. In fact, these English pioneers were
                    "considered as little above jack rabbits and prairie squirrels" by the native
                    frontiersman until such a time as their activities had proved invaluable to the new community.</p>

            <p>Differences of opinion grew up between Birkbeck and Flower. A possible cause for the dislike of
                    Flower by Birkbeck may have been that both were interested in a young woman, who was one of the
                    first group of emigrants from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. The young woman, Eliza Julia Andrews, turned a deaf ear to Birkbeck's
                    proposal when he asked her to become his second wife, while she showed favor to Flower who married
                    her at <placeName>

                    Englishmen, Birkbeck was generally considered broad-minded in regard to politics and religion. Being

                    He believed firmly that every citizen should have a right to vote. Like many pioneer leaders, his
                    usefulness was keenly felt. However, his career was cut short when he was drowned in crossing the
                    Fox river on his return from a trip to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>

                            reconciliation to "that sense of justice in Mr. Birkbeck that prompted him to
                            repair the injury inflicted from erroneous impressions or heat of temper". William

                            sides to the controversy. Faux was closely associated with both Flower and Birkbeck for a

                        <region type="county">Scott</region>
                    </placeName> County mass convention as delegates to the Democratic state convention started for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> from Scottsburg. They were Jefferson Gladden, Chas. W. Cruson, David M. Hughbanks,
                    Harry Jewett, Mark Storen and Elijah A. Gladden. Of these all have passed away except Elijah A.
                    Gladden, the writer of this reminiscence.</p>
            <p>On the train, we fell in with Jonas Howard, the nominee for Congress from the old third congressional
                    district, S. M. Stockslager, Col. Tom Hanlon, John Benz and many other active Democrats. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> we fell in with Green Smith, <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, we were impressed at the size of the railway station, or rather its lack of size, it
                    being no larger than the Scotts-burg depot. We went north on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Street to Market Street and then east to the Circle which was a small park at that
                    time, the monument being erected several years later. We went to the English Hotel where all six of
                    us were assigned to a commodius room. After dinner we went out to see the city. The court house was
                    the only large building to be found. The state house was built to the third story. The Fletcher
                    building and the magnificent union station were both fairy dreams. We went about town on street cars
                    drawn by mules, the mule cars not being supplanted by electric cars until 1893. We spent a pleasant
                    night at the hotel.</p>
            <p>The next morning it was decided that Elijah A. Gladden should be the Chairman of the delegation and
                    that the delegation should follow the unit rule. The convention met at nine A.M. in the English
                    Opera house, it being the largest place in the city for such meetings. The convention was called to
                    order and Doctor Abbott offered the invocation. In his prayer the doctor asked the Lord to bless the
                    "Grand Old Democratic Party". No sooner had he asked this of the Lord than a large
                    number of the delegates cheered him to the echo. Senator Frank B. Burk, who was seated in the midst
                    of those cheering, arose and in a cynical voice asked the assembled delegates if they had never been
                    any place that they did not know the difference <pb n="227" id="VAA4025-031-3-059"/> between a
                    prayer and a Democratic speech. The doctor smiled and went on with his prayer.</p>
            <p>The old <hi rend="i">Indiana Journal</hi> poked fun at the doctor inquiring, "Surely doctor,
                    you do not expect the Lord to grant such a large request"? But the prayer was fully
                    answered for the Democrats elected <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> president, a Presbyterian, as was the doctor. Thomas A. Hendricks was elected
                    Vice-President. He was a deacon in the doctor's church. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hendricks</region>
                    </placeName> influenced <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Jones was also a deacon in the doctor's church. It was a remarkable and
                    unusual prayer and to the doctor it must have seemed to get results.</p>
            <p>After the doctor's prayer, the convention was organized in due form. Senator Daniel W.
                    Vorhees was elected chairman; <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> Dixon was made roll-call clerk; and William H. English read the platform which was
                    unanimously adopted. There were several candidates for Governor but Isaac P. Gray was nominated on
                    the first ballot. As he was a great debater, the Democrats expected good results from his speeches.
                    General Mahlon D. Manson would doubtless have been nominated for Governor if it had not been for the
                    fact that the Republican party four years before this had challenged the Democrats to debate.
                    Franklin Landers, the Democratic candidate had accepted the challenge for thirteen joint debates
                    with Albert G. Porter and had been completely outclassed.</p>
            <p>The Democrats, following the nomination of Isaac P. Gray, now challenged the Republicans to thirteen
                    joint debates, which challenge was accepted and the candidates started to carry out the agreement.
                    After three discussions, William H. Calkins, the Republican candidate, was so nearly used up by Gray
                    that he declined to meet him in any further encounters.</p>
            <p>In the selection of a candidate for lieutenant-governor, after seven candidates had been presented,
                    Col. Tom Hanlon placed in nomination the name of General Manson and all the other candidates
                    withdrew. General Manson also tried to withdraw but before he could arise from his seat three
                    enthusiastic Democrats seized him and held him in his chair but in doing so they tore his linen
                    duster completely off of him. The general was then unanimously nominated for Lieutenant-Governor.
                    The convention by a unanimous vote instructed the delegates to the National Democratic Convention
                        <pb n="228" id="VAA4025-031-3-060"/> to vote for Thomas A. Hendricks as a candidate for

                    </placeName>. The writer recalls his amusement when he noted that of the more than one hundred men
                    who were on the stage all wore whiskers except oneâ€”John W. Holcomb. Among many to be
                    noted for their luxuriant whiskers were Senator D. W. Vorhees, William H. English, David Turpie,
                    Green Smith and John W. Kern.</p>
            <p>The convention adjourned at two o'clock and the six of us from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Scott</region>
                    </placeName> County went to the union depot to go home on the five o'clock train. The
                    conductor, however, informed us that the train did not stop at Scottsburg. C. W. Cruson asked if he
                    would let us off at Marshfield, the watering tank north of Scottsburg. The conductor replied,
                    "That depends on what engine we have." He called the engineer to him and said,
                    "Buck, will you have to take water at Scottsburg this evening?" The engineer
                    replied, "I see they are all Democrats and like my engine always faithful so we will just
                    have to stop for water at Marshfield this evening." The conductor then said, "All
                    right, boys," and we all got on. When the train stopped at Marshfield, we all got off.
                    After a thirty minute hike we reached home in time for supper.</p>

            </byline>
            <p>Very few high school teachers of history are without degrees. Many have sought, or are seeking, the
                    degree of master of artsâ€”a very laudable effort. The teacher with a bachelor's
                    degree who is in love with history and who wishes to keep growing, soon feels the urge to pursue the
                    subject further. School superintendents quite generally desire their teachers to do work leading to
                    an advanced degree. It is easier to point with pride to high school faculties when a considerable
                    number of the teachers have done, or are doing, graduate work. The prestige of the school becomes
                    greater, and likewise that of the superintendent, as the training of teachers is extended. Because
                    of these things and because teachers become more efficient through additional study, salary
                    increases are frequently promised to those who complete the requirements and receive higher degrees.</p>
            <p>The desire to add to one's prestige, to earn a higher salary, to place one's self
                    in the way of promotionâ€”any of these is praiseworthy. There are, however, some dangers to
                    be guarded against. Real worth is not a mere matter of time spent taking courses that will count
                    toward a coveted degree. Moreover, a master's degree is not something that should be
                    granted or received as a mere matter of course after a year of additional work with grades not
                    falling below a certain minimum. The graduate student should look on the extra period of study as a
                    privilege. He should lose interest in many of the activities that absorbed his hours when an
                    undergraduate. For the first time in his school career, he has the opportunity to work exclusively
                    in the field where his greatest interest lies. If he does not have a vital interest in some field,
                    sufficient ability to master the courses selected, a burning desire to increase his scholarship, and
                    the power to extract real enjoyment from his studyâ€”he has no valid reason for seeking an
                    advanced degree.</p>
            <p>Graduate students seeking master's degrees are required to pass each course taken with a
                    satisfactory grade, and they are usually required to present a thesis and to pass an oral
                    examination. It seems entirely reasonable that each of these <pb n="230" id="VAA4025-031-3-062"/>
                    conditions should be fairly met. Even when a student has met the set requirements, the degree is
                    frequently conferred with misgivings. There is a characteristic which should belong to the holder of
                    an advanced degree which is hard to define with precision, but it is a healthy, determined attitude
                    in regard to the pursuit of the subject in which the degree has been soughtâ€”an
                    unquenchable desire to know more accompanied by an anxiety to learn the best methods of obtaining
                    the necessary data and judging its value.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the following message if carried away by each student departing from an institution with a
                    master's degree in history would exert an influence for good:</p>
            <p>"You have met the requirements laid down for you. You have been subjected to certain tests
                    and you have passed them. The degree has been conferred upon you, but, whether you really deserve it
                    or not, only the future can determine. To be worthy of the degree, you must not permit your interest
                    in the subject to wane. Your desire to know more must grow and you must read and search for new
                    knowledge the rest of your days. You must make a reasonable effort to keep in touch with the growing
                    literature of your field. You should, if you do not do more, carry on modest investigations from
                    time to time and write up the results of your efforts. If you find it utterly impossible to write,
                    you should read more extensively, being certain to study some good piece of published or unpublished
                    contemporary material from time to time. All these obligations rest upon you. You can and should
                    fulfill them. If you regard your work as done when you receive the degree or allow yourself to drift
                    into an attitude which amounts to the same thing, as too many have done and are doing, you should
                    never have sought the degree. It is your privilege to take your stand among those who will keep the
                    sacred fire burning as long as they live."</p>

            <p>A hundred or more persons taking advantage of an opportunity to meet for the first time in a State
                    Genealogy Conference, a steadily increasing patronage in the Genealogy Section of the Indiana State
                    Library, and other "signs of the times," seem to offer substantial proof that
                    there is no dearth of interest in the subject of genealogy in the state of Indiana.</p>
            <p>Mr. G. B. Utley, of the Newberry Library, addressing the conference last December, called attention
                    to the importance of Indiana as a field for genealogical research. The strategic geographic position
                    of the state made it not only a pathway in the early migrations of the pioneers, but a lodging-place
                    as well. Few states have a more important or more interesting early history than Indiana, and
                    interwoven with its history as a state, we find the history of its families. Many of these family
                    names have been prominently identified with the history of the growth of the nation itself. With
                    each passing year, we will find the genealogist turning with increased interest and expectancy to
                    the annals of Indiana.</p>
            <p>Records are the basis upon which successful genealogical research is founded. While a certain amount
                    of information may be handed down "by word of mouth," it is only to the written or
                    printed word that the ancestry seeker can turn with any feeling of security.</p>
            <p>The library in the Genealogy Section of the Indiana State Library represents the largest single
                    collection of its kind in Indiana, and one of the largest in this part of the country. Its main
                    object is to afford the people of Indiana a source of information to which they can appeal in their
                    efforts to establish connecting links in their family history. Since this is a library for the
                    people of the state and its main purpose is to serve, we feel no hesitancy in calling attention to
                    some of its needs.</p>

                    How could "book committees" working in the eighties or earlier, foretell that the
                    books of their choice would in 1935 be counted absolutely essential to any reputable genealogical
                    collection? This same wisdom and foresight has continued through the years until it can be safely
                    said today that the library in the Genealogy Section of the Indiana State Library is fundamentally
                    sound.</p>
            <p>To continue building on this foundation, or to maintain so admirable a standard set by those in the
                    past, is one of the chief concerns and aims of the Genealogy Section.</p>
            <p>Possibly in no other section of a library is the material so uniformly expensive as in a genealogical
                    collection. Prices are often prohibitive. A sum sufficient to purchase a half dozen books in some
                    other part of a library, may cover the cost of merely a single volume of some important genealogical
                    work. For this reason it is necessary to exercise the greatest care and discrimination in selection.
                    Often one must let slip by an opportunity to buy "while the buying is good" and
                    frequently one fears to make a decision lest something more needed present itself later.</p>
            <p>Since the opening of the genealogy room as a separate section, the public has been commendably
                    generous in its contributions to the shelves. Many gifts from individuals have been received.
                    Patriotic and pioneer organizations have become interested and are adding not only books and
                    manuscript material, but subscriptions to periodicals, and are even considering projects. The spirit
                    with which these gifts have been offered leads us to believe that they will increase as people
                    become more acquainted with our needs.</p>
            <p>We would like to call particular attention to family histories. The value of a compilation cannot
                    always be measured in dollars and cents and often a manuscript of a few pages is of as great
                    practical use as some large publication, and both are equally welcomed. We have recently received
                    some very important family histories, whose purchase price would have been out of the question. In
                    the preparation of the noteworthy D.A.R. records which are being compiled in the various counties in
                    Indiana, provision is made for placing one copy in the State Library. We wish a similar plan might
                    be followed in the case of family histories. Aside from the value <pb n="233" id="VAA4025-031-3-065"/> of the book to a patron, it might mean the book's own presservation. Books owned by
                    individuals are subject to many vicissitudes, but by placing a family history in the library, the
                    family will have at least one copy for the use of future generations. A gift of this kind means also
                    that another book is added to the library, since the price of this family history can be applied to
                    some other purchase.</p>
            <p>Locality is the foundation store for genealogical research, and it was upon this basis that the
                    Catalogue Department devised the system of classification which has shelved the genealogical
                    material so satisfactorily. The arrangement of the material on the separate states is geographical,
                    each state followed by its county and town records, and county and town records furnish one of our
                    most dependable sources of information. The splendid Indiana collection of county histories remains
                    shelved in the Indiana history room, easily available from the Genealogy room. These are in constant
                    use. In regard to the local histories of some of the other states, there is much material yet to be
                            desiredâ€”<placeName>

                    </placeName> are lacking, and as the western states become older, we find our need increasing for
                    more of their local records.</p>
            <p>The history of early Indiana families is so closely linked with that of the history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> families, that it is to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> records that we must constantly turn for connecting links, and yet in proportion to the
                    number of requests received along this line, our material seems sadly inadequate. Would not some one
                    like to help us build up this particular corner in the room?</p>
            <p>On account of the lack of records, little can be done in the tracing of an ancestry in foreign
                    countries. We hope some time to have such compilations as the Harleian Society Publications, dealing
                    with Parish registers and Visitations of the heralds in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. We covet other works, especially illustrative, on the subject of heraldry. But for the
                    present, we realize that these constitute merely a "pipe dream," although we are
                    sustained by the hope that later they may become a reality.</p>
            <pb n="234" id="VAA4025-031-3-066"/>
            <p>These are some of our needsâ€”so varied that we sometimes find ourselves wishing that we
                    might have an old-fashioned donation party.</p>
            <p>The material in the Genealogy Section is of such a nature that obviously it cannot be circulated. It
                    is a reference collection which the public expects to find on the shelves. Consequently, more
                    particular attention is paid to that patron who does not have access to the library. Copying is done
                    to a certain extent, and the effort is made to put the patron in touch with records on the shelves.</p>
            <p>After all, this quest for an ancestry is a cultural undertaking, and Indiana is to be congratulated
                    upon having reached this stage in her development.</p>
            <p>We have been taught that a workman is no better than the tools he has in hand. With the rapidly
                    spreading interest in family histories in Indiana, we have faith to believe that the people of the
                    state will cooperate in the proper maintaining of its chief source of genealogical information.</p>

                    </placeName>, August the 28th, 1823. He died March 2nd, 1908. He was the youngest of a brood of
                    eightâ€”six boys and two girls. He was "the last run of shad," to use the
                    phrase of Theodore Parker, who had a similar honor. Just why the youngest should eclipse the rest,
                    as occasionally happens, is explained by Dr. Tilden on the hypothesis that a mother gives this last
                    little surprise party an amount of love and tenderness not vouchsafed to the rest.</p>
            <p>[The father of Jamie Oliver was a shepherd on a landed estate in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. He was a very poor man who lived in a small cottage. In 1830, when Jamie was seven
                    years of age, his eldest brother, John, came to America where he found work at one dollar per day. A
                    little later another brother, Andrew, and a sister, Jane, followed John to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The mother became filled with a great desire to cross the Atlantic, and, before a
                    great while, though the father was very loth to leave the home-land, the rest of the family came to
                    join John, Andrew and Jane at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Geneva</settlement>, <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
               </placeName>. Jamie found a chance to work for a farmer at
                    fifty cents a week and board. In 1836 the Olivers migrated westward to La-Grange County, Indiana,
                    but soon moved on to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mishawaka</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a growing little city.</p>
            <p>Jamie had a chance to attend school for one term. Then his father died, which ended his formal
                    education. He worked for a while on the <geogName>St. Joseph River</geogName> as a poleman on a
                    boat. Occasionally, he did odd jobs for Joseph Doty. On such occasions, he dined with the Doty
                    family. It was thus that Susan Doty entered into his life. It was probably because of a remark which
                    he heard her make that the boy quit the river, <list type="footnotes">

                    shut down, he learned the cooper's trade. He remained friendly with Susan Doty and read
                    with her what the Doty home offered. The opportunity to read several periodicals and forty books was
                    of real importance in that day. James and Susan, who were of the same age fell in love. The Dotys
                    were English and the family stood higher than the Olivers. They objected to a marriage, but out on
                    the frontier, it was only necessary for the young man to buy a two-room house for eighteen dollars
                    in cash, the lot thrown in, to obtain the consent of Susan's parents. It was on May 30,
                    1844, that the marriage took place. The young couple began their married life in the new house which
                    "was a well built cottageâ€”not very large but big enough for two. It was a slab
                    house, with a mud chimney and a nice floor of pounded blue clay. It had two rooms, a cupboard across
                    the corner, a loft to store things in, and forty wooden pegs to hang things on." For these
                    young people married life began at twenty-one.]</p>
            <p>James Oliver was thirty-two years old before he really struck his pace. He had worked at the
                    cooper's trade, at molding and farming.</p>
            <p>His twenty-dollar house at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mishawaka</settlement>
                    </placeName> had transformed itself into one worth a thousand, fully paid for. The God's
                    half-acre had become a quarter-section.</p>
            <p>His wife had beauty and competence, two things which do not always go together. She was industrious,
                    economical, intelligent and ambitious. She was a helpmate in all that the word implies. The man
                    whose heart is at rest is the only one who can win. Jealousy gnaws. Doubt disrupts. But love and
                    faith mean sanity, strength, usefulness and length of days. The man who succeeds is that one who is
                    helped by a good woman.</p>
            <p>Two children had come to them. These were Joseph D. and Josephine. Napoleon was always a hero to
                    James Oliverâ€”his courage, initiative and welling sense of power, more than his actual
                    deeds, were the attraction. The Empress Josephine was, a better woman than Napoleon was a man,
                    contended Susan. Susan was right and James acknowledged it, so the girl baby was named Josephine.
                    The boy was named Joseph, in honor of his grandfather Doty who had passed <pb n="238" id="VAA4025-031-3-070"/> away; but who, before his passing, had come to see that Nature was
                    nearer right than he had been.</p>
            <p>Children should exercise great care in the selection of their parents. Very, very few children are
                    ever dowered with a love that makes for strength of head, hand and heart, as were these. In Eighteen
                    Hundred and Fifty-five, James Oliver was over to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a town that had started up a few miles down the river from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mishawaka</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and accidently met a man who wanted to sell his one-fourth interest in a foundry. He
                    would sell at absolutely inventory value. They made an inventory and the one-fourth came to just
                    eighty-eight dollars and ninety-six cents. Oliver had a hundred dollars in his pocket, and paid the
                    man at once.</p>
            <p>Cast-iron plows formed one item of this little foundry's work. Oliver, being a farmer, knew
                    plowsâ€”and knew that there was not a good plow in the world. Where others saw and
                    accepted, he rebelled. He insisted that an approximately perfect plow could be made. He realized
                    that a good plow should stay in the ground without wearing out the man at the handles.</p>
            <p>The man who hasn't been jerked up astride of plow handles or been flung into the furrow by a
                    balky plow has never had his vocabulary tested.</p>
            <p>Oliver had a theory that the plow should be as light in weight as was consistent with endurance and
                    good work, and that a moldboard should scour, so as to turn the soil with a singing sound; then the
                    share, or cutting edge, must be made separate from the moldboard so as to be easily and cheaply
                    replaced. A plow could be made that needn't be fought to keep it furrow-wise.</p>
            <p>Without tiring the reader with mechanical details, let the fact be stated that after twelve years of
                    experimentingâ€”planning, dreaming, thinking, working, striving, often perplexed,
                    disappointed and ridiculedâ€”James Oliver perfected his Chilled Plow. He had a moldboard
                    nearly as bright as a diamond and about as hard, one that "sang" at its work.
                    Instead of a dead pull, "it sort of sails through the soil," a surprised farmer
                    said. To be exact, it reduced the draft on the team from twenty per cent to one-half, depending upon
                    the nature of the soil. It was the difference between pulling a low-wheel lumber wagon, and riding
                    in a buggy with your girl. Then the old share, if worn, could be replaced <pb n="239" id="VAA4025-031-3-071"/> by the farmer himself, without even calling on the local blacksmith.</p>
            <p>From this on, the business grew slowly, steadily, surely. James Oliver anticipated that other
                    plow-wise Scot, Andrew Carnegie, who said, "Young man, put all your eggs in one basket and
                    then watch the basket." On this policy has the Oliver Chilled Plow works been built up and
                    maintained, until the plant now [1909] covers seventy-five acres, with a floor space of over thirty
                    acres and a capacity of over half a million plows a year. The enterprise supplies bread and butter
                    to over twenty thousand mouths, and is without a serious rival in its chosen field. If the horse
                    tribe could speak, it would arise and whinny paeons to the name of Oliver, joining in the chorus of
                    farmers. For a moldboard that always scours gives a peace to a farmer like unto that given to a
                    prima donna by a dress that fits in the back.</p>
            <p>The one particular thingâ€”the Big Ideaâ€”in the Oliver plow was the chilled
                    moldboard. Chilling the iron, by having a compartment of water adjoining the casting clay, gives a
                    temper to the metal that can be attained in no other way. To produce a chilled moldboard was the one
                    particular achievement of James Oliver. Others had tried, but the sudden cooling of the metal had
                    caused the moldboard to warp and lose its shape, and all good plowmen know that a mold-board has to
                    have a form as exact in its way as the back of a violin, otherwise it simply pushes its way through
                    the ground, gathering soil and rubbish in front of it, until horses, lines, lash and cuss words drop
                    in despair, and give it up. The desirable and necessary thing was to preserve the exact and delicate
                    shape of the moldboard so that it would scour as bright as a new silver dollar in any soil, rolling
                    and tossing the dirt from it. An Oliver moldboard has little checkerboard lines across it. These
                    come from marks in the mold, made to allow the gas to escape when the metal is chilled, and thus all
                    warping and twisting is prevented.</p>
            <p>James Oliver was the inventor of an implement which is supplied to the user at a moderate cost. This
                    toolâ€”one particular pattern of Oliver Plowâ€”has been made for over forty-years,
                    better finished and lightened possibly, but unchanged <pb n="240" id="VAA4025-031-3-072"/> in style
                    and design. This plow has been used and is still being used in every corner of the wide world where
                    men tickle the soil that it may laugh a harvest. Hundreds of attempts have been made to improve on
                    this plow, to change or modify it. Oliver himself tried to revise it, but the so-called improvements
                    were eliminated by time and the plow reverted to type. And it remains to-day the biggest seller in
                    the plow world. Elderly men come now to buy this plow that they used in boyhood and refuse to take
                    any other. In fact, the present writer recently bought one of these plowsâ€”an exact
                    duplicate of one he used in McLean County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1869.</p>
            <p>The idea of this plow sprang from the brain of James Oliver as Minerva, sprang from the brain of
                    Jove, full armed. Its tests for efficiency and endurance have been the most searching possible. It
                    has been used by three generations of men, and to-day the Oliver Chilled Plow Works are producing
                    seven times as many chilled plows as their largest competitor.</p>
            <p>The Olivers have never been in a "trust" or "combine." And
                    moreover, they will never lend themselves to any trust in the future. This is their determined and
                    unalterable policy. Their goods are sold in the open market, in competition with many other
                    manufacturersâ€”the field is a free one. And not even their most prejudiced competitor has
                    ever accused them of coercing the consumer, of banking on his necessities, or of oppressing labor.</p>
            <p>When James Oliver was last approached on this theme, after the matter had been pushed upon his
                    attention several times with various and sundry tempting offers to put the Plow Works into a
                    "Community of Interest," or what is vulgarly called a Trust, he replied,
                    "I do not care for your money, neither do I nor my family wish to go out of business. We
                    are not looking for ease or rest or luxury. I love this institution, and if I go into this combine,
                    granting I will make more money than now, what is to prevent your shutting down these works and
                    throwing all these people who have worked for me all these years out of employment? And how would
                    that affect this city which has been my home and the home of those I love? No, sir, your talk of
                    more money and less responsibility means nothing to me. I want my children to always feel the stress
                    and strain of work, and never to forget the burdens of life, in order that they may <pb n="241" id="VAA4025-031-3-073"/> respect the burdens of others. To be free to come and go is
                    deathâ€”morally and mentally, if not financially. Not only do the Olivers run this business
                    to make good plows, but they run it for the economic and educational good of themselves, and of all
                    the great Oliver Family who make Oliver Plows and who follow in fresh furrows behind them. So you
                    see, gentlemen, how little your argument is worth as regards more money, greater ease and less
                    responsibility. And if it ever comes to a show-down, I'll take less money and more work,
                    rather than greater ease and more money. That is the Oliver Policyâ€”more work and work for
                    everybody who wants to work. Next, more plows, and if it is possible, better plows. And as for the
                    money part, that will take care of itself." And this same sentiment has since been repeated
                    by Joseph D. Oliver.</p>
            <p>The Oliver fortune is founded on reciprocity. James Oliver was a farmerâ€”in fact it was the
                    joke of his friends to say that he took as much pride in his farming as in his manufacturing. Mr.
                    Oliver considered himself a farmer, and regarded every farmer as a brother or partner to himself.
                    "I am a partner of the farmer, and the farmer is a partner of Nature," he used to
                    say. He always looked forward to the time when he would go back to the farm and earn his living by
                    tilling the soil. He studied the wants of the farmer, knew the value of good roads, of fertilizers,
                    drainage, and would argue long and vigorously as to the saving in plowing with three horses instead
                    of two, or on the use of mules versus horses. He loved trees, and liked to plant them himself and
                    encourage boys to plant them. He had positive views as to the value of Clydesdales compared with
                    Percherons.</p>
            <p>So did he love the Clydes that for many years he, drove a half-breed, shaggy-legged and flat-tailed
                    plow horse to a buggy, and used to declare that all a good Clyde really needed was patience in
                    training to make him a race-horse. He used to declare the horse he drove could trot very
                    fast,â€”"If I would let him out." Unhappily he never let him out, but the
                    suspicion was that the speed limit of the honest nag was about six miles an hour, with the driver
                    working his passage. Ayrshire cattle always caught his eye, and he would stop farmers in the field
                    and interrogate them as to their success in cattle breeding. When told that his love for Ayrshire
                        <pb n="242" id="VAA4025-031-3-074"/> cattle was only a prejudice on account of his love for
                    Robert Burns, who was born at Ayr, he would say "A mon's a mon for a'
                    that." He declared that great men and great animals always came from the same soil, and
                    that where you could produce good horses and cattle you could grow great men. Mr. Oliver was always
                    devising ways to benefit and brighten the lives of families on the farms.</p>
            <p>For music he cared little, yet during the seventies and eighties he had a way of buying
                    "Mason and Hamlin" organs, and sending them as Christmas presents to some of his
                    farmer friends where there were growing girls. "A sewing machine, a Mason and Hamlin organ,
                    and an Oliver Plow form a trinity of necessities for a farmer," he once said. When Orange
                    Judd first began to issue his "Rural American," the enterprise received the hearty
                    interest and support of Mr. Oliver and he subscribed for hundreds of copies. He thought that farmers
                    should be the most intelligent, the most healthy and the happiest people on earthâ€”nothing
                    was too good for a farmer. "Your business men are only middlemenâ€”the farmer digs
                    his wealth out of the ground," he used to say. He quoted Brigham Young's advice to
                    the Mormons, "Raise food products and feed the miners and you will all get rich. But if you
                    mine for gold and silver, a very few will get rich, and the most of you will die poor."</p>
            <p>So here is the point, James Oliver was more interested in industrialism than in finance. His interest
                    in humanity arose out of his desire to benefit humanity, and not a wish to exploit it. If that is
                    not a great lesson for the young, as well as old, then write me down as a soused gurnet. The gentle
                    art of four-flushing was absolutely beyond his ken. He was like those South Sea Islanders told of by
                    Robert Louis Stevenson, who didn't know enough to lie, until after the missionaries came,
                    when they partially overcame the disability.</p>
            <p>James Oliver didn't know enough to lie. He knew only one way to do business, and that was
                    the simple, frank, honest and direct way. That great <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> politician whose shibboleth was, "Find your sucker, play your sucker, land
                    your suckerâ€”and then beat it," would have been to him hopeless Choctaw.</p>
            <p>To sell a man a plow at a price beyond its worth, or to <pb n="243" id="VAA4025-031-3-075"/> sell a
                    man anything he did not need, was to him a calamity for the seller, just as it was for the buyer.
                    His ambition was to make a better plow than any other living man could make, and then sell it at a
                    price the farmer could afford to pay. His own personal profit was a secondary matter. In fact, at
                    board meetings, when ways and means were under discussion, he would break in and display a
                    moldboard, a coulter or a new clevis, with a letter from Farmer John Johnson of Jones'
                    Cross Roads, as to its efficiency. Then when the board did not wax enthusiastic over his new toy he
                    would slide out and forget to come back. His heart was set on making a better tool, at less expense
                    to the consumer, than the world had ever seen. Thus would he lessen labor and increase production.
                    So beside great talent he had a unique simplicity, which often supplied smiles for his friends.</p>
            <p>James Oliver had a warm sort of feeling for every man who had ever held the handles of an Oliver
                    Plowâ€”he regarded such an one as belonging to the great family of Olivers. He believed
                    that success depended upon supplying a commodity that made the buyer a friend; and Heaven, to him,
                    was a vast County Fair, largely attended by farmers, where exhibitions of plowing were important
                    items on the program. Streets paved with gold were no lure for him. In various ways he resembled
                    William Morris, who when asked what was his greatest ambition, answered, "I hope to make a
                    perfect blue," and the dye on his hands attested his endeavors in this line. Both were
                    workingmen, and delighted in the society of toilers. They lived like poor men, and wore the garb of
                    mechanics. Neither had any use for the cards, curds and custards of what is called polite society.
                    They hated hypocrisy, sham, pretense, and scorned the soft, the warm, the pleasant, the luxurious.
                    They liked stormy weather, the sweep of the wind, the splash of the rain and creak of cordage. They
                    glorified in difficulties, reveled in the opposition of things and smiled at the tug of inertia. In
                    their natures was a granitic outcrop that defied failure. It was the Anglo-Saxon, with a goodly
                    cross of the Norse, that gave them this disdain of danger, and made levitation in their natures the
                    supreme thingâ€”not gravitation.</p>
            <p>Zangwill has written it down in fadeless ink that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="stk">Scotland</region>
                    </placeName> has produced three bad things: Scotch humor, Scotch <pb n="244" id="VAA4025-031-3-076"/> religion and Scotch whiskey. James Oliver had use for only one of the commodities just
                    namedâ€”and that was humor. Through his cosmos ran a silver thread of quiet chuckle that
                    added light to his life and endeared him to thousands. Laughter is the solvent for most of our ills.</p>
            <p>All of his own personal religionâ€”and he had a deal of itâ€”was never saved up for
                    Sunday; he used it in his business. But James Oliver was a Scotchman and, this being so, the fires
                    of his theological nature were merely banked. When Death was at the door an hour before his passing,
                    this hardy son of heath and heather, of bog and fen and bleak north wind, roused himself from stupor
                    and in his deep, impressive voice, soon to be stilled forever, startled the attendants by the stern
                    order, "Let us Pray!" Then he repeated slowly the Lord's Prayer, and with
                    the word "Amen," sank back upon his pillow to arise no more.</p>
            <p>For Scotch whiskey he had less use than he had for Scotch religion. He cursed the stuff in good,
                    stiff, unco words, that were not always to be found in Webster's Unabridged. For the
                    occasional drunken workman, he had terms of pity and sentences of scorn in alternation. At such
                    times the Scotch burr would come to his lips, and the blood of his ancestors would tangle his
                    tongue.</p>
            <p>One of his clerks once said to me, "As long as Mr. James talks <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, I am not alarmed, but when he begins to roll it out with a burr on his tongue, as if
                    his mouth were full of hot mush, I am scared to death." It should be here explained that
                    there were two of these Olivers, "Mr. James" and "Mr. Joseph
                    D."â€”father and son. And there be many good men and discerning who aver that
                    without the son, the father would not have come into the lime-light, and that the greatest
                    achievement of James Oliver was not the Oliver Chilled Plow, but Joseph D. Oliver, still happily
                    unchilled [1909].</p>
            <p>Without detracting from the meed of praise that is due James Oliver, the truth should be stated that
                    alone he could never have built up or extended this business to its present colossal proportions.
                    The fact that an invention is useful and much needed does not insure its success.</p>
            <p>For while it is true that only a useful invention or appliance can at the last succeed, yet the
                    further fact remains <pb n="245" id="VAA4025-031-3-077"/> that because it is good is no sign it will
                    go. It will not necessarily succeed any more than moral virtue and spiritual beauty will be popular
                    next year at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlantic City</settlement>
                    </placeName> and on Fifth Avenue.</p>
            <p>Good things go only when captained by big men. It is a question of generalship, or salesmanship. It
                    is a matter of marketing your wares. The superior man is not the one who thinks great thoughts, but
                    he who expresses them so as to give humanity a vibe and a list to starboard.</p>
            <p>Success is voltage under controlâ€”keeping one hand on the transformer of your kosmic
                    kilowatts.</p>
            <p>So to the argument: Excellent inventions and mines with pay gravel are nil and nit and mox nix ouse,
                    as we say in the classics, until a man with phosphorus in his ego takes the management and
                    transforms chaos into cosmos.</p>
            <p>We all see big pictures in our dream mirror when drunk on art, love, dope or religion, but the boy
                    who puts his picture on the canvas and sells it to Col. Pierpont <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan</region>
                    </placeName>â€”he is the only one who is really IT.</p>
            <p>So when you tell me of your wonderful invention and want to sell me stock in your company, just bring
                    me a snapshot of the man who is going to manage your concern, as well as a list of what he eats and
                    drinks, the hours he sleeps and how he exercises both his body and sky-piece.</p>
            <p>Then I'll talk with you about investing.</p>
            <p>While Joseph D. Oliver lacks the picturesque crankiness of the older man, he has a mental reach and a
                    judicial outlook upon the world which James Oliver never had. He is a diplomat, a financier, an
                    organizer. He is a judge of men, and never does a thing he can get some one else to do for him. Big
                    men succeed through the process of selection. Joseph D. Oliver has a wise sense of values, and rare
                    good taste as to the eternal fitness of things. He manages men without their knowing it. And let
                    this be said, James Oliver was big enough to leave all questions of salesmanship and finance to his
                    son. For over thirty years, Joseph D. Oliver has been the actual working manager of the business. He
                    knows every corner and cranny of this vast industry, and has the broad, prophetic outlook of a great
                    Captain of Industry. He holds the ship safe and true to her course. The Oliver Opera House and that
                    paragon of hostelries, "The <pb n="246" id="VAA4025-031-3-078"/> Oliver Hotel,"
                    were the ideas of James Oliver, materialized by Joseph D. When I was told that James Oliver was the
                    richest man in Indiana, I said to myself, "Well, his son is the best ballasted man,
                    mentally and physically and spiritually, in Indianaâ€”and perhaps in America."
                    That sounds like oxaline, I know, but the remark is carefully considered. I weigh my words. When we
                    so often see great wealth coupled with great weakness, is it not a satisfaction to find a rich man
                    who is moderate in all the affairs of life, who is liberal but not lavish, who conserves his
                    nerve-force and who realizes that great wealth is a responsibilityâ€”a stewardship?</p>
            <p>Joseph D. Oliver is so big and great that he has always been quite willing to stand in the shadow. He
                    has not clutched for honors; he has not asked for applause. The sycophant and flatterer have never
                    been able to move him. He is an educated gentleman in the best sense of the word, and he is also a
                    workingman. His life is devoted to this great science of businessâ€”to creation and
                    distribution. Yet he knows history, loves music and literature, delights in Nature, appreciates the
                    plain, simple joys of Life and practices the great and manly virtues, without which the greatest and
                    richest is something less than a man. His family relations are the happiest, sweetest and sunniest.
                    He has two sonsâ€”James and Joseph Doty, Jr.â€”fine hearty young men, who are
                    being brought up to work, as boys should and must if they would elude the frowns of Fate and dodge
                    her Stuffed Club. [Joseph D. Oliver died on August 6, 1933.]</p>
            <p>The social and financial bounder may have his use, but I do not know what it is unless it be as a
                    microbe of dissolution. But of such is not the House of Oliver.</p>
            <p>It will not do to make James Oliver out a religious man in a sectarian sense. He did however have a
                    great abiding faith in the Supreme Intelligence in which we are bathed and of which we are a part.
                    He saw the wisdom and goodness of the Creator on every hand. He loved Natureâ€”the birds in
                    the hedgerows and the flowers in the field. He gloried in the sunrise, and probably saw the sun rise
                    more times than any other man in Indiana.</p>
            <p>"The morning is full of perfume," he used to say. And so it is, but most of us need
                    to be so informed.</p>
            <p>He believed most of all in his own mission and in his own divinity. Therefore he prized good health,
                    and looked upon <pb n="247" id="VAA4025-031-3-079"/> sickness and sick people with a touch of scorn.
                    He reverenced the laws of health as God's Laws, and so he would not put an enemy in his
                    mouth to steal away his brains. He used no tobacco, was wedded to the daily cold bath and was a
                    regular amphibian for splashing. He had a system of calisthenics which he followed as religiously as
                    the Mohammedan prays to the East. The pasteboard proclivity was not one of his accomplishments.</p>
            <p>But a few months before his death he was missed one day at the works. His son thought he would drive
                    out to his farm and see if he was there. He was there all right, and had just one hundred and
                    twenty-seven men, by actual count, digging a ditch and laying out a road.</p>
            <p>James Oliver wasn't a man given to explanations, apologies or excuses. His working motto
                    usually was that of Rev. Dr. Jowett of Baliol, "Never explain, never
                    apologizeâ€”get the thing done, and let them howl!" But on this occasion,
                    anticipating a gentle reproach from his son for his extravagance, he said, "All right, Joe,
                    all right. You see I've been postponing this tarnashun job for twenty years, and I thought
                    I'd just take hold and clean it up, because I knew you never would!"</p>
            <p>He was let off with a warning, but Joseph had to go behind the barn and laugh.</p>
            <p>One thing that was as much gratification to Mr. Oliver as making the road, was the sense of motion,
                    action, bustle and doing things. He delighted in looking after a rush job, and often took charge of
                    "the boys" personally. For the men who made the plows, his regard was as great as
                    for those who used them. He moved among the men as one of them, and while his discipline never
                    relaxed, he was always approachable and ready to advise even with the most lowly. His sense of
                    justice and his consideration are shown in the fact that in all the long years that the Oliver Plow
                    Works has existed, it has never once been defendant in a lawsuit in their home county, damage or
                    otherwise.</p>
            <p>Thousands of men have been employed and accidents have occasionally happened but the unfortunate man
                    and his family have always been cared for. Indeed, the Olivers carry a pension roll for the benefit
                    of widows, orphans and old people, the extent of which is known only to the confidential <pb n="248" id="VAA4025-031-3-080"/> cashier. They do not proclaim their charities with a brass band. James
                    Oliver thought that a man should live so as to be useful all of his days. Getting old was to him a
                    bad habit. He did not believe in retiring from business, either to have a good time or because you
                    were old and bughouse. "Use your faculties and you will keep them," he used to
                    repeat again and again. He agreed with Herbert Spencer that men have softening of the brain because
                    they have failed to use that organ. And certainly he proved his theories, for he, himself, was sane
                    and sensible to the day of his death. Yet when certain of his helpers, bowed beneath the weight of
                    years and life's vicissitudes, would become weak and needful of care, he would say,
                    "Well, old John has done us good work, and we must look after him." And he did.</p>
            <p>He would have denied that he was either charitable or philanthropic; but the fact was that the Golden
                    Rule was a part of his business policy, and beneath his brusque outside, there beat a very warm and
                    generous heart.</p>
            <p>When the financial panic of Eighteen Hundred and Ninety-three struck the country, and dealers were
                    canceling their orders, and everybody was shortening sail, the Olivers kept right along
                    manufacturing and stored their product. Never have they laid off labor on account of hard times.
                    Never have they even shortened hours or pay. This is a record, I believe, equaled by no big
                    manufacturing concern in America. In October, Nineteen Hundred and Seven, when workmen were being
                    laid off on every hand, the Olivers simply started in and increased their area for the storage of
                    surplus product. They had faith that the tide would turn, and this faith was founded on the
                    experience of forty years and more in business. Said James Oliver, "Man's first
                    business was to till the soil; his last business will be to till the soil; I help the farmer to do
                    his work, and for my product there will always be a demand."</p>
            <p>James Oliver had no fear of death. He had an abiding faith that the Power that cared for him here,
                    would never desert him there. He looked upon death as being as natural as life and probably just as
                    good. For the quibbles of theology he had small patience. "Live right hereâ€”wait,
                    and we shall know," he used to say.</p>
            <p>When his wife died, in Nineteen Hundred and Two, he <pb n="249" id="VAA4025-031-3-081"/> bore the
                    blow like a Spartan. Fifty-eight years had they journeyed together. She was a woman of great good
                    sense, and a very handsome woman, even in her old age. Her husband had always depended on her,
                    telling her his plans and thus clarifying them in his own mind. They were companions, friends,
                    chums, loversâ€”man and wife. After her death he redoubled his activities, and fought
                    valiantly to keep from depressing the household with the grief that was gnawing at his heart. A year
                    passed, and one day he said to his son, "Joe, I do miss your mother awfullyâ€”but
                    then I'll not have to endure this loneliness forever!"</p>
            <p>And this was as near a sign of weakness as he ever showed. A woman once came to Mr. Oliver soliciting
                    subscriptions for some sort of doubtful charity. She was so persistent, that to get rid of her Mr.
                    Oliver took out of his pocket a silver dollar and pushed it across the desk to her.</p>
            <p>With lofty contempt the woman said, "I have no use for such an insignificant sum."</p>
            <p>And with great courtesy, Mr. Oliver replied, "Madam, I have," and promptly picked
                    up the dollar and put it back in his pocket.</p>
            <p>He was neither a miser nor a spendthrift. He always knew the value of a dollar, and always his
                    earnest desire was to so invest his money that it would add to the business prosperity of the
                    community, and in fact the whole country. James Oliver was a successful man, but it was not always
                    smooth sailing. In the early days the Plow Plant caught fire at night and was absolutely consumed.
                    Returning home at three o'clock in the morning, exhausted, and with clothing wet and frozen
                    in a sheet of ice, this man sorely kicked by an unkind fate, turned a chair over on the floor before
                    the fireplace, and reclining on it, there with eyes closed, endeavored to forget the trying scenes
                    of the night.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Oliver had made coffee and prepared a simple breakfast for the tired man. But rest was never for
                    her or her family when there was pressing work demanding attention. "James, why are you
                    wasting time! Drink this coffee, put on these dry clothes and go at once before daylight and order
                    lumber and brick so the men can begin at seven o'clock to rebuild. We have orders to
                    fill!" And the man arousing himself, obeyed the command. At seven o'clock the
                    lumber <pb n="250" id="VAA4025-031-3-082"/> was on the ground and the men were at work preparing to
                    rebuild. James Oliver was a man of course, but his patience, persistency and unfaltering faith were
                    largely the reflection of his wife's soul and brain. When seventy years of age, a neighbor
                    once dropped in for a little visit and in conversation referred to Mr. Oliver's being a
                    rich man.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said this kindly old Spartan, "Yes, they say I am rich, but if I
                    didn't have a dollar, I would still be richâ€”with a wife like that!" and
                    he pointed to his partner of nearly half a century.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Oliver smiled and said chidingly, "Now James!" But he continued, "I
                    say, mother, if we did not have a dollar, we could still earn our living with our hands at just
                    plain hard work, couldn't we?" And the old lady (who really was never old)
                    replied, "Yes, James, we could earn our living with our hands, and we would not be
                    miserable over it either."</p>
            <p>Near the close of his wonderful career, Pericles said, "I have caused no one to wear
                    crepe." The Hon. Marvin Campbell, in a speech at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, once quoted this remark of the man who built the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Athens</settlement>
                    </placeName> and added, "Not only can we pay James Oliver the compliment of saying that he
                    never caused any one to wear crepe, but no one ever lost money by investing either in his goods or
                    his enterprises, and moreover no one ever associated with him who did not prosper and grow wiser and
                    better through the association." A few weeks before his passing, some one told him this
                    little story of Tolstoy's: A priest, seeing a peasant plowing, approached him and said,
                    "If you knew you were to die tonight how would you spend the rest of the day?"</p>
            <p>And the peasant promptly answered, "I would plow." It seems the priest thought the
                    man would answer, "In confession," or "In prayer," or
                    "At Church." The priest then replied, "My friend, you have given the
                    wisest answer a man can possibly make, for to plow is to pray, since the prayer of honest labor is
                    always answered."</p>
            <p>The story impressed Mr. Oliver. He told it to several people, and then made a personal application of
                    it, thus: "If I knew I were to die to-night, I would make plows to-day."</p>

                        <p>As I have a day or two of leisure while retiring from the toils of the campaign, I
                                    have concluded to devote a few minutes to our friends abroad, that they may know how
                                    we stand in this State and what they may expect of us. I begin with you because you
                                    are always first in my mind when I think of the probability of Gen.

                        <p>Since I came home from <placeName>

                                    anything like a <hi rend="i">conviction</hi>â€”that nearly all the Whig

                                            admitted to the bar, and began to practice in <placeName>
                                                <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                                            </placeName>. He served in both houses of the Indiana Legislature. He was an
                                            ardent Whig and was elected to the national House in 1841, serving one term.
                                            He removed to <placeName>

                                            </placeName> where he lived during the remainder of his long life. He was
                                            elected to the national House in 1847. The presidential contest of 1848 came
                                            in the midst of his term, but there was no congressional election in Indiana
                                            during that year. Thompson was a very conservative Whig as this letter and
                                            his speeches in Congress show. See <hi rend="i">Congressional Globe</hi>, 30

                                    all the orthodox Quakers will do soâ€”while the Hicksites will be inclined
                                    to go for V. Burenâ€”as most of them are Abolitionists. On the whole I am
                                    satisfied that there are changes enough from the Democrats to overcome the majority
                                    of Polk,<hi rend="sup">5</hi> and that if we can only keep our men away from this
                                    "Free Soil" movement we can carry the State. But you know the
                                    disadvantages under which we must labor, when, instead of attacking the enemy, and
                                    as Kendall said 'charging along the whole line', we are compelled
                                    to spend our time to keep our own party together. You will see therefore that we can
                                    promise nothing, and that the vote of the State is too doubtful to be calculated on.
                                    To sum it all up, the probabilities are against usâ€”though we may succeed.
                                    The fact is the canvass did not open soon enough. When we got home from <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, we found the Whigs generally dispirted with the conviction that the
                                    State was certainly lost; and of course nothing had been done. We got up our Fort

                                    it, but I fear it has not been followed up with energy enough. Our speakers have
                                    been slow to go to work. The most of them speak at the Courts and neglect the
                                    country. Meetings at the County Seats are generally attended with no good. They warm
                                    up both parties. I have, myself, attended but one Court since I came home, and that
                                    in my own townâ€”and shall attend no moreâ€”having given myself up
                                    entirely to the work. My plan is to get the people together in the country towns and
                                    in their own neighborhoods and talk to them, and the result is that I think my

                                            figure predicted by Thompson. The VanBuren electors polled 1,588 votes as
                                            against 583 for Birney electors in 1844, in this district.</item>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1935. Pp. 81 (221â€“302), fifty cents.</head>
            <p>This pamphlet is No. 4, Vol. XI, of the Indiana Historical Society <hi rend="i">Publications.</hi>
                    Sixty of the eighty-one pages are taken up with a single letter of Jacob Schramm, dated April 10,
                    1836, and written in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hancock</region>
                    </placeName> County, Indiana. This long letter, which the writer completed at the end of two months
                    after he began it, was addressed to his brother-in-law and sister-in-law in Saxony. It was designed
                    to furnish a detailed account of the trip to America and of the experiences of Schramm and his
                    family on the Indiana frontier, where they had lived for the greater part of the period since
                    leaving Bohemia, which was almost a year when the letter was completed. Besides this lengthy
                    epistle, there are but three short letters in the collection; one from Mrs. Schramm's
                    father to his children, friends, neighbors, acquaintances and brother; one from Mrs. Schramm to her
                    sisters; and one from Jacob Schramm and wife to a friend in Bohemia, bearing the date, June 20,
                    1836.</p>
            <p>There is a "Preface to the Translation" by Dr. Christopher B. Coleman, Secretary of
                    the Indiana Historical Society, and a "Note to the Translation" at the end which
                    includes nearly five pages quoted from the translator. Mrs. Vonnegut furnishes information relative
                    to the Jacob Schramm family and home during the generation following 1836. The mother of Mrs.
                    Vonnegut was Marie Mathilde Schramm, second daughter of Jacob Schramm, who married Henry Schnull of <placeName>

            <p>The Schramm letters fell into the hands of C. C. Kutschera soon after reaching relatives and friends
                    in Saxony who published them at Saaz in 1837. It was this old German booklet of that date which Mrs.
                    Vonnegut translated for her children and grand-children. A copy of the original publication together
                    with her translation in manuscript, Mrs. Vonnegut presented to the Indiana Historical Society. To
                    her and to the Society, all who read the pamphlet under review are under great obligations.</p>

                    detail from beginning to end. The language is good, the intelligence of the writer is manifest, and
                    no reader can doubt his sincerity. Many students of Indiana history have read numerous first-hand
                    descriptions of life in the frontier period, quite a few of which are as valuable and interesting as
                    this by Jacob Schramm. It seems too bad that he did not write a new account of his pioneer
                    experiences ten or twenty years after his arrival in Indiana. While he had not been in his new
                    environment, when he wrote in 1836, long enough to properly evaluate his opportunities, he did
                    present a good picture of what the first year on a frontier farm was like. In regard to the sea

                    colonists from these states avoided Indiana. Undoubtedly what they had heard about the wet lands
                    influenced them to go to <placeName>

                    </placeName> states, there were living in Indiana in 1850, 10,646. In 1860, the figure was 12,307,
                    an increase of only 1,661. In <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the increase in Indiana from 1850 to 1860 was 6,545; the increase in <placeName>

                    been hard to understand why the westward moving currents from New <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> avoided Indiana, and Professor Power is to be commended for the discovery of one
                    important explanation.</p>
            <p>Though it is true that there was a considerable amount of flat, wet land north of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName> in Indiana, it is likewise true that almost every where there were in close proximity
                    rolling lands that invited settlement. Often the wet, level strips were not a mile wide and were
                    bordered by the valleys of little creeks, larger creeks and rivers along the bluffs of which farms
                    were laid out all through the country, not by pioneers from New <placeName>

                    </placeName>, but by a large number of colonists who came from the older areas of Indiana
                    supplemented by considerable numbers from <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName> and foreign

            <p>It should be remembered that <placeName>

                    </placeName> were all younger than Indiana. The increase in population in these states, from outside
                    sources, was naturally greater than that of Indiana in the later antebellum period. <placeName>

                    </placeName>, in the national House and in the electoral college in the last decade before the Civil
                    War is revealed in the number of representatives apportioned to each following the census of 1850:
                    Indiana, 11; <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

                    </placeName>, 2. The population of Indiana in 1840 was 685,886; in 1850, it was 988,416, surpassed
                    only by <placeName>

                    </placeName> among the states west of the mountains. By 1860, Indiana, with a population of

                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, being now behind only <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, of the states in the trans-Appalachian area. On the eve of the Civil War, only <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> among the older states ranked above Indiana in population. The facts here presented
                    seem to leave little room for the contention that Indiana deserved to be thought of as a
                    "benighted" region in the important period of growth preceding 1860. In the three
                    quarters of a century since, Indiana has receded, relatively, in economic importance, but whether it
                    has likewise receded, relatively, in other matters is open to serious question. Professor Power, in
                    as far as he has explained the effects of Indiana's wet lands on migration from the older
                    East, has done well. When he accepted the notion that the Hoosier state deserved a reputation as a
                    backward commonwealth in the days before the Civil War, he fell into error, because he failed to
                    consider a mass of evidence that proves the contrary. In regard to a "Hoosier
                    Stereotype", he produces no evidence of value. It is, in fact, very unfortunate that he
                    permitted himself to include anything on this subject in his article. That a Hoosier stereotype may
                    exist or may have developed in the period covered by the article, "Wet Lands and the
                    Hoosier Stereotype" is not denied. The only point made here is that in the study under
                    review, the author seems to have made no progress in regard to the matter.</p>

            <p>It has been the policy of the present editor to set aside two or three pages of this quarterly, a
                    sort of corner of his own, where he could comment on anything of interest in his own way. For eight
                    years (he began with the issue of September, 1928, and has brought out every issue since), he has
                    dealt briefly with questions pertaining to the study and writing of history, and also with current
                    problems when their solution rested upon an understanding of historical facts. It has been
                    impossible not to express conclusions or opinions antagonistic to those held by various persons and
                    elements when dealing with certain problems that have been considered in these pages. The editor and
                    no one else should be held responsible for any and all statements that have here appeared. No one
                    has been obliged to read his comments, and certainly no one has been required to accept any view of
                    the editor. What has been published here must stand or fall on its merits. The view is held by some
                    that, since the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> is partly supported from public funds,
                    no discussion of controversial questions of current interest should appear in its pages. The
                    position of those who hold this view may be sound. If too rigidly applied, there would be times, it
                    seems, when one supported partly or entirely by public funds would have little left to write or
                    speak about while attempting to carry on.</p>
            <p>In one of his stories, Mark Twain had a teacher of history ask a class of boys and girls the hard
                    question, "What is the Constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>?" The designated member of the class stood, and, after he had paused a while
                    for ideas and suitable words out of which to frame the complete sentence required by the
                    schoolmistress, gave this answer: "The Constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is the fine print in the back of the history." Why the great instrument has
                    always appeared in the back of the text-book in exceedingly fine print is a question that has never
                    been answered. Perhaps the fact that the copy of the Constitution which most of the mature citizens
                    of our country were asked to study when children in the public schools was so extremely unattractive
                    to the eye accounts for the sad lack of knowledge in regard to the contents of the revered document.
                    It is surely not <pb n="261" id="VAA4025-031-3-093"/> too much to say that everyone who talks or
                    writes on the Constitution should first read it carefully and try to understand <hi rend="i">all</hi> of it. Among the important clauses that should not be ignored are the following:</p>
            <p>"The Congress shall have power to â€¦ provide for the â€¦ general welfare
                    of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>."</p>
            <p>"The Congress shall have power to regulate commerce â€¦ among the several States.
                    â€¦"</p>
            <p>"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
                    exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people
                    peacably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances". (First
                    amendment).</p>
            <p>As a general rule, the state historical magazines of the country carry much news relative to local
                    historical activities and local historical writing. The Indiana Historical Society publishes the <hi rend="i">Indiana History Bulletin</hi> in which appear items covering the activities of county
                    and other local historical organizations and items relative to articles published in local
                    newspapers. The <hi rend="i">Bulletins</hi> of the Society are available to all readers of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, and, since the Society through the <hi rend="i">Bulletins</hi> reports local activities so extensively and well, the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, in what is conceived to be a proper spirit of cooperation, leaves this field
                    entirely to the Historical Society.</p>
            <p>Corrections: In the June issue, the name of Clyde F. Snider, who contributed a review was erroneously
                    spelled <hi rend="i">Snyder.</hi> In the same issue, the editor, in his review of the volume, <hi rend="i">Catharine Merrill: Life and Letters</hi>, spoke of the compiler as "Mrs.
