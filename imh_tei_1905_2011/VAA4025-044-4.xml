            <p>John Francis Hamtramck is a forgotten hero of American history. He is not among the elect in the
                    Dictionary of American Biography, although his name is mentioned there in the sketch of his son, a
                    much less distinguished person, and Stewart H. Holbrook did not bring him out of oblivion to
                    associate with the men whom he spotlighted in the pages of his book, <hi rend="i">Lost Men of
                        American History.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are many reasons why Hamtramck deserves to be remembered. Leaving his homeland while still a
                    youth, he joined the army of General Richard <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName> in the fall of 1775, and served through the Revolutionary War, rising to the rank of
                    brevet major. Afterwards, under General Josiah Harmar in the Old Northwest, he built and commanded
                    several forts. As lieutentant colonel commanding the First Sub-legion, he won General Anthony <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>'s commendation for his valor in the Battle of Fallen Timbers; became the first
                    American commandant of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>; and after having attained the rank of colonel, organized the expeditionary force that
                    built Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName>, the nucleus of the metropolis of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. For all these services he should receive some recognition, at least in the valley of
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>It is true that a city in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> bears his name, but he is a stranger there. No memorial to the Colonel can be found in
                    that city, but the oversight will one day be corrected; for a recent communication from the
                    mayor's office contained the assurance that when a new city hall is built, it will display
                    some mark of acknowledgment.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> receiving prisoners returned by the Indians,<hi rend="sup">6</hi> and in October he
                    marched his company to Fort Pitt.</p>
            <p>Ordered to Fort McIntosh on the Little Beaver, he found the works in a state of decay and the
                    barracks uninhabitable. Floors, doors, and windows were gone, and Captain John Doughty, the former
                    commandant had left no tools except an old handsaw, "whose teeth," Hamtramck
                    declared, "has been worn out in the service of its Country."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                    Captain Hamtramck remained in the fort as commandant until July 1, 1786.</p>
            <p>At this time he was nearly thirty years old. One-third of his life had been spent as an army officer,
                    and it is likely that his character was pretty definitely formed. Although no portrait of Hamtramck
                    has ever been discovered, and no biography has been written, it is possible from bits of description
                    and from contemporary correspondence to draw a fairly clear sketch of the man.</p>
            <p>Hamtramck did not make an impressive appearance either mounted or on foot. Small in stature, only
                    five feet five inches tall, he is said by one who knew him well to have looked in the saddle like a
                    frog on horseback. The same witness declared, however, that "He had the faculty of
                    inspiring the men with self-confidence, and, notwithstanding he was a most rigid disciplinarian, the
                    troops all loved him, for he was kindhearted, generous, and brave."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>Although English was not his native tongue, Hamtramck was able to express himself in that language
                    clearly, if somewhat quaintly. Judging by his correspondence, one might say that he had a peppery
                    disposition, he was quick to discover and denounce delinquencies of subordinates, and he drove
                    himself as hard as he drove his men. He was an able officer in whom his superiors, from <placeName>

                    </placeName> to <placeName>

            <p>Early in July, 1786, Colonel Harmar put Hamtramck in command of the companies of Captain John Mercer
                    and Captain William McCurdy, as well as his own, and sent him down the <geogName>Ohio
                    River</geogName> to Mingo Bottom to drive squatters from the public domain.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> In
                    obedience to his orders, detachments marched to the clearings where they burned the cabins and
                    destroyed the growing corn of illegal settlers.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This work was soon interrupted by an order from Colonel Harmar directing Captain Hamtramck to move at
                    once to the intersection of the western boundary of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> with the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> where he would find Captain Thomas Hutchins,

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, with his corps of surveyors.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> A military escort was essential if
                    they were to perform their task, for the Indians, understanding that surveying was the prelude to
                    settlement, resented the intrusion of these men; and their determination was strengthened by the
                    advice of Captain Alexander McKee, British Indian agent at <placeName>

                    </placeName>, who continued to urge resistance to American expansion north of the <geogName>Ohio

            <p>Captain Hamtramck joined Hutchins on August 5 with his three companies, to which Colonel Harmar soon
                    added that of Captain Jonathan Heart, when the Geographer asked for more soldiers. During the late
                    summer and early fall of 1786, Hamtramck kept detachments out in the woods with the surveyors and
                    moved his camp from time to time so that he was always in a position to send reinforcements to any
                    party that might be attacked.</p>

                    completed their houses. Reporting to Colonel Harmar, Hamtramck observed that "the

                    little command were in constant danger of being cut off by hostile Indians.</p>
            <p>Major Hamtramck immediately set the soldiers to work building a fort under the direction of Captain
                    Ferguson. Progress, however, was slow because timber had to be hauled from a great distance; and it
                    was not until April, 1788, that the palisade was in place and the blockhouses were completed to the
                    second story. Then the Major expressed confidence in his ability to defend the works against any
                    Indian attack if sufficient provisions were sent to him.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his new post which, by order of Colonel Harmar, he had named Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName>, Hamtramck found the contractor even less reliable than he had been on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. When his store of provisions was nearly exhausted, he appealed to François
                    Vigo, who willingly furnished supplies for the garrison on credit,<hi rend="sup">26</hi> despite the
                    fact that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government had not yet reimbursed him for the funds he had expended to assist George
                    Rogers Clark during the Revolution.</p>

                    </placeName> was not popular with either officers or men. The former complained that prices were so
                    high they could not live on their subsistence allowances. Recognizing the injustice of their
                    situation, the Major arranged for the issue to them of a soldier's ration in addition.</p>
            <p>The men disliked serving in this out of the way place where the food was scanty and of poor quality,
                    and their pay was always far in arrears. When their terms of enlistment ran out, it was almost
                    impossible to induce them to re-enlist, with the result that at times the garrison was dangerously
                    small. Besides, malaria sent many of them to the hospital every summer. The Commandant himself did
                    not escape the annual visitation, and the surgeon seldom had quinine or other medicines.</p>
            <p>Besides having to solve the problems incident to maintaining a distant outpost, Hamtramck was
                    burdened with governing the French civilians as well. Accustomed to being <list type="footnotes">

                    redress of all sorts of grievances.</p>
            <p>Their greatest complaint was against the magistrates whose principal occupation seemed to be
                    collecting exorbitant fees. In answer to a petition of the inhabitants, Hamtramck drew up a set of
                    regulations for a new judicial system. Five justices were to be elected by the people. Petty cases
                    would be tried by one justice, two would hear suits of more importance, and a bench of three would
                    sit as a district court in which trial by jury would be compulsory. The Commandant established a
                    scale of reasonable fees and required the magistrates to take an oath before him to administer
                    justice impartially.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sending a copy of the regulations to General Harmar, Hamtramck observed: "My Code of laws
                    will make you laugh, but I hope you will Consider that I am neither a lawyer or a legislator. I have
                    done it for the Best. One good thing is that there is not one amongst them that can find fault with
                        it."<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The people of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> country also appealed to Hamtramck for courts and for an officer and twenty men to
                    support the civil authority. Declaring that it would be impossible to continue living in a community
                    plagued by anarchy and confusion, they predicted that the few who remained would soon join those who
                    had crossed into Spanish territory. The Major was unable to send a detachment because many of his
                    men were ill, but he forwarded the petition to headquarters and expressed the hope that a garrison
                    would be provided.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

            <p>The people in the western country believed that they had been completely forgotten by the <placeName>

                    </placeName> government. On several occasions reports reached the villages that Governor Arthur St.
                    Clair would soon visit them, but they proved to be only rumors. In August, 1789, Hamtramck, almost
                    in despair, wrote to General Harmar: "If his Excellency does not come this year…
                    most people will go away to the Spaniards, for they begin to think that there is no such a Man as a
                        Governor…."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>Finally in March, 1790, the Governor reached Kaskaskis and established <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Clair County</region>
                    </placeName>; and Winthrop Sargent, as acting-governor, going to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

                    </placeName>, thus relieving the Commandant of the necessity of improvising civil government. The
                    French inhabitants were not unmindful of Major Hamtramck's labors in their behalf. They
                    handed Sargent a letter in which they praised the "just and humane attention"
                    which he had paid "to the rights and feelings of every individual craving his
                        interposition."<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In August, 1790, shortly after Sargent left town, Major Hamtramck married Marie Josepte Edeline
                    Perrot, a resident of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the widow of Nicholas Perrot, a trader of that place. For some reason, the Major
                    did not inform General Harmar of his marriage; but when the latter learned of it, he sent his
                    congratulations and Mrs. Harmar's to the groom and asked him to present their
                    "kind compliments" to Mrs. Hamtramck.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although the details of military administration and the troubles of the civilians kept Major
                    Hamtramck pretty busy, the Indians were his most serious problem. He maintained friendly relations
                    with the neighboring tribes, but he was powerless to prevent raids into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> by bands of savages, and they even attacked his own soldiers. In July, 1788, a party of
                    fifty ambushed a detachment of thirty-six men under Lieutenant William Peters, which was bringing
                    provisions up the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>

            <p>Hamtramck suspected that Frenchmen of <placeName>

                    </placeName> might have informed the Indians that the provisions were on the way, and after several
                    were apprehended carrying barrels of the contractor's flour into town at night, he
                    expressed the belief that some of them might even have participated in the fight.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> A year later, however, when he <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Major Hamtramck's task was made more difficult by marauding Kentuckians. One day in August,
                    1788, a ruffian who called himself Major Patrick <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> appeared at Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> with sixty mounted riflemen. Blandly announcing that he was hunting Indians and
                    boasting that he had killed nine that morning, he asked for boats to ferry his men across the river.
                    When the Commandant discovered that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> had no commission and that he had stolen horses from the French and the Indians of the
                    locality, he ordered him to give up the animals and be gone the way he had come.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> insolently refused, took the boats tied up at the shore, and crossed the river.
                    Hamtramck, who had just nine men fit for duty, could only stand and look on in impotent rage. To
                    General Harmar he confessed: "Never was my feeling [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] so much wounded
                        before."<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Recognizing the need for more troops, Harmar sent Captain James Bradford with his company of
                    artillery early in 1789. This reinforcement increased the garrison of Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> to 140.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In March, 1790, Hamtramck received from Governor St. Clair a speech to be sent by a trusty messenger
                    to the Indians of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and to the Miami, urging them to make peace with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Antoine Gamelin, who carried the speech, was courteously received by the tribes on the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, but they frankly told him that their reply would depend on that of the Miami. When
                    Gamelin delivered the Governor's message to the Miami chiefs, they refused to answer it

            <p>Hamtramck set out on September 30, 1790, with 330 men and advanced to the Vermilion towns without
                    opposition. The Indians, who had learned of the expedition, had withdrawn. Finding that his supplies
                    were running low, and failing to induce the militia to accept half rations for an advance to the Wea
                    villages, the Major turned back toward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, chagrined that he had marched so far for nothing. In his report to General Harmar he
                    declared that "had I to deal only with regular troops, I should order them to live on the
                    Barks [<hi rend="i">sic<hi rend="sup">]</hi>

                        necessary…."<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, General Harmar with his motley army proceeded to the Miami villages, which also had been
                    deserted. The troops destroyed cabins and cornfields; but after three separate columns which the
                    General sent out had been severely mauled by Indians lurking in the woods, he retreated to Fort <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>General Harmar's own experiences with militia on his expedition gave him an understanding of
                    Hamtramck's predicament. Consequently, in replying to the latter's report he
                    assured him that "your conduct during your tour has met my approbation."<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Governor St. Clair asked Major Hamtramck for his recommendations on Indian affairs in the West. In

                    </placeName> on December 2, 1790, the Major declared that "The Indians never can be subdued
                    by just going into their towns and burning their houses and corn and returning the next day, for it
                    is no hardship for an Indian to live without; they make themselves perfectly comfortable on meat
                    alone; and as for houses, they can build them with as much facility as a bird does his
                    nest."</p>

            <p>The only proper maneuver, he asserted, was a surprise attack upon the villages by a force of mounted
                    riflemen. He observed, however, that there would be no peace so long as the British held the western
                    posts and continued to encourage Indian hostility to Americans. On the other hand, if a treaty
                    should be made, he declared, the Kentuckians would break it and no jury in <placeName>

                    </placeName> would punish the offenders.</p>
            <p>Hamtramck summed up his findings as follows: "These combined circumstances, sir, make me
                    think that, until we are securely intrenched in the Indian country, we can never be sure that peace
                    is fully established; for as the thirst of war is the dearest inheritance an Indian receives from
                    his parents, and vengeance that of the Kentuckians, hostility must then be the result on both
                        sides."<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Five years' experience in the Indian country was condensed into these conclusions of Major
                    Hamtramck. His argument was sound, but the people clamored for vengeance: and so General St. Clair
                    set out with another army made up largely of undisciplined militia, which plodded blindly to its
                    doom.</p>
            <p>Major Hamtramck, commanding the First Infantry Regiment, was not present at the debacle of November
                    4, 1791. Ordered back from Fort Jefferson on October 31 by General St. Clair to capture sixty
                    deserting militiamen who had gone off swearing to plunder an expected commissary train, or at least
                    to protect the supplies and bring them in safely, Hamtramck with his regiment marched southward,
                    while the rest of the army advanced.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finding neither deserters nor the supply train, Hamtramck turned northward again to rejoin St. Clair.
                    Having passed Fort Jefferson and hearing the sound of distant cannon fire, he advanced until fleeing
                    militiamen gasped out the news that the army had been totally destroyed. Still more than twenty
                    miles from the battle and fearing for the safety of Fort Jefferson, which was garrisoned only by
                    invalids, he sent Lieutenant William Kersey forward with a detachment and retired with the remainder

                    assigned to it, he too would leave the service. As might be expected of an old soldier, Hamtramck
                    was skeptical about the effectiveness of the new invention, the Legionary Corps, and asked what

            <p>Late in June, 1797, General James Wilkinson, who had succeeded to the command of the army after the

                    garrison, and British subjects were enticing American soldiers to desert and cross the river.
                    Because civilians were involved, Wilkinson proclaimed martial law within the circuit of the palisade
                    around the town, thereby arousing the resentment of the merchants, most of whom intended to retain
                    their British allegiance.</p>
            <p>General Wilkinson had been dissatisfied with conditions at Fort <placeName>

                    </placeName> also. His solution for the problems at the two posts was to exchange garrisons and
                    commandants. Lieutenant Colonel Hamtramck with the First Regiment was transferred to Fort <placeName>

                    In his home he had a small library which contained among other books <hi rend="i">The Life of

            <p>In the spring of 1803, in obedience to orders from Secretary of War Henry Dearborn, Colonel Hamtramck
                    made arrangements to send a detachment under Captain John Whistler to build a fort at the mouth of
                    the <geogName>Chicago River</geogName>. No less an authority than Milo M. Quaife has held that

            <p>The Colonel, however, was not permitted to have any further hand in the work, for he died on April

                    ample precedent for his turning to America as the place to make the great social experiment. For two
                    centuries the disheartened and the disillusioned of Europe had been crossing the Atlantic to the new
                    Canaan to set up societies, theocratic and economic, on a soil untainted by the corruptions and
                    perversions of the Old World.</p>
            <p>In the promised land, where fertility and salubriousness were already legendary, new civilizations
                    were certain to thrive. Owen was no stranger to these visions. Furthermore, had not the inhabitants

                    Europe? John Q. Adams, among others, had listened approvingly as he poured the "new view of

            <p>James Kirke Paulding also belonged to this second critical group. While Fisher gently and effectively
                    undermined the philosophical foundations of Owenism, Paulding belabored them with sarcastic bludgeon
                    hoping to reduce them to ridiculous nonsense. Paulding's <hi rend="i">Merry Tales</hi>
                    satirized several prevailing notions. The three wise men of Gotham put out to sea in a bowl bound,
                    most naturally, for the Concentric Spheres, the area inside the hollow terrestrial globe seriously

                    make this wise decision. The first wise man, Mr. Harmony, told a tale about himself, "The

                    his history, "The Perfection of Reason" (Common Law); and the third, Dr. Spurrem,

            <p>The Man Machine had been born in a country "unworthy of his nativity," the son of a
                    poor man whose only wealth was a "fruitful wife and a great store of children." He
                    had been bound out from the ages of nine to thirteen to a factory owner who worked him fourteen
                    hours a day and even fined him for sneezing though he was choking from cotton dust. Then, a
                    celebrated philanthropist conceived a plan devoted to the production of cotton cloth and the
                    perfectibility of man. The Man Machine began working in the new factory after his old employer had
                    fined him for wiping away tears occasioned by listening to a bird singing outside the factory
                    window. His new employer gathered five hundred men, women, and children about him and made a speech
                    expounding his social theories. The "new view of society" was enthusiastically set
                    in operation.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Soon, however, "counteracting principles"
                    began to interfere with the philanthropist's schemes. To check these disturbing forces he
                    attempted to train the children <hi rend="i">ab ovo</hi>,<hi rend="sup">21</hi> though with
                    indifferent success. One such child was eventually brought to perfection; he would do only what he
                    was told to do and he met an early demise by being run over by a wagon since no one in authority was
                    near to tell him to get out of the way. Such things as emulation, imposition, preferences, and petty
                    inequalities continued to upset the master's schemes. Whatever success the project enjoyed
                    resulted from the efforts of the "committee of managment" which did all the
                    thinking, planning, and deciding.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> The workers accepted the rule of the
                    committee because the community's common surplus fund was steadily increasing. The

                            gay birds in all directions, leaving a disconsolate teacher without any scholars, but

            <p>Finally, the Man Machine came into a small fortune. Offered the position of treasurer if he would
                    invest it in the factory-community, he refused and returned to the world to put the "new
                    views of society" into practice on his own estate. He was soon mulcted of most of his
                    property and his own steward had him sent to a madhouse. When released, the Man Machine sold his
                    estate to the steward and set out for the new world with what remained of his wealth. Fleeced of
                    that remainder by a fellow passenger, he was thrown into jail. A kind American rescued him from this
                    predicament and gave him a home and employment. Unfit for any labor requiring individual
                    responsibility and unable to convert his American benefactor to his views, the Man Machine longed to
                    leave. Happily, he heard of the "sublime theory of Concentric Spheres" and set out
                    at once for that region to seek anew the "perfectibility of man." Such was the Man
                    Machine's story as he told it to his two companions in the bowl.</p>
            <p>Paulding's arguments against Owenism centered about three points: (1) Owen's denial
                    of inherent traits or passions, (2) his disregard of the natural inequalities in man, (3) his
                    failure to provide a positive incentive to virtue.</p>

                            those who left the colony the Man Machine has this to say: "What became of the
                            grown up children, thus putting themselves upon their country, destitute of the habits and
                            experience necessary to self-government, security, nay, existence in the wide world, I know
                            not to a certainty. I have heard that many were wrecked upon the unknown coast of the world,
                            and that the remainder, during a great part of their lives, were indebted for support, to

                    inner temperament of man. He returned to this problem no less than three times in the satire.
                    Typical of his argument is the following dialogue between the philanthropist (Owen) and the Man
                    Machine. What were the "counteracting principles"? the Man Machine asked. They are
                    "all those vices, folies, inconsistencies, absurdities, habits, principles, and feelings,
                    which an erroneous system of education for the last six thousand years has implanted in the human
                    race, so as to change, as it were, their very natures, making them almost unsusceptible of
                        perfectibility."<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What was an erroneous system of education? continued the Man Machine. "A system which
                    counteracts human nature." But, can there be such a thing if "human
                    nature" is merely wax? countered the Man Machine. <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Having thus made the Owenite philanthropist look ridiculous, Paulding, somewhat too smugly,
                    considering the weaknesses of his method, turned to the assumption that lay behind Owen's
                    denial of an inherent human nature. Owen maintained that the factors in human conduct that led to
                    evil—envy, ambition, malice, etc.—were primarily the result of inequalities.
                    Eliminate inequalities and much of man's "evil nature" will disappear. To

                    distinction based on property, there were still serious tendencies toward inequality that could not
                    be eradicated. Equality could not be achieved. The young men all wanted to marry the same girl and
                    could not be persuaded that another girl was equally good. The lady whose husband had a ten-year
                    claim on the surplus fund looked down on the lady with only a five-year stake in that fund. She
                    valued the difference as much as if she actually possessed it. Prettier children were another source
                    of inequality. The philanthropist could regulate the number of children but not their looks. A
                    dispute between two women arose over the position of their parlors; one faced north, the other
                    south. The dispute spread to the entire community; the factionalism was not ended by the
                    master's decision that to be in the sun in winter was equal to being out of it in summer.
                    Equality, not the exercise of talent was the purpose of the community; consequently, no system of
                    rewards could be employed. The Man Machine once tried to achieve the master's favor, but he
                    found that he was resented and hated. "Individual perfectibility was incompatible with the
                    perfectibility of the whole, and the only way to preserve HARMONY was to be no better than other
                        people."<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>Paulding, like Aldous Huxley, was intrigued with the idea that the collectivistic society destroyed
                    all incentive to complete, wholesome, virtuous living. As there were no "mutual wants,
                    mutual weaknesses, and mutual dependence, there was no room, nor indeed any occasion, for the
                    exercise of the social virtues, except so far as they are negatively exercised in refraining from
                    actual violence or injury." Only the chief and the planning committee exercised any powers
                    other than the capacity to work. There could be no use of virtue, talent, or intelligence by the
                    members of the community. <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>His later career may be divided into distinctive periods of business activity and can be understood

                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>

                    River</geogName>. He transacted business with the neighboring Indian bands, sent outfits to trade
                    for furs among bands farther removed from him, and supplied a few necessities to other white traders
                    and squatters of the area. His post was not a significant one for its financial returns. The post
                    was established to reach Indians who no longer came to Fort <placeName>

                    in the opening of northern Indiana to white settlers. The station must then be considered as an
                    infiltration move, and Taylor as an advance agent to prepare for white settlement. Taylor <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The partnership of Hanna and Taylor was ended in 1836. Hanna may have decided that it was time to

                    Taylor's affairs.</p>
            <p>The Panic of 1837 came soon after the firm's name was changed to The L. M. Taylor Store.
                    This was a period of severe struggle to find markets in which to buy at the most advantageous prices
                    and to collect on the credit sales made in the past. Taylor was so successful that he emerged in a
                    stronger financial position than he had occupied before the panic. He owed much of his success to
                    profits from fur trade and the certainty of collection of Indian accounts by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> treaties with the Indians. A movement to bring a bank to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> was an effort for financial survival. He relinquished the public offices of County
                    Clerk and Recorder that he had held, after attempting unsuccessfully to gain re-election to the
                    office of Clerk of the Circuit Court.</p>
            <p>A careful inventory in 1841 showed that he had survived the panic, and he once more interested
                    himself in community affairs. Railroad building was again possible. Taylor was an active leader but
                    was defeated in a factional <pb n="369" id="VAA4025-044-1-045"/> struggle for control of railway
                    routes in 1847. He sold his store and stock of goods to his brother, E. Pitts Taylor, a few months
                    later.</p>
            <p>The final chapter in his business career extended from 1847 to 1856, when he retired. He operated as
                    an independent fur buyer and handled more furs than before but without the other lines of the
                    general merchant. Despite the Potawatomi removals of 1838 and 1840, there were still Indian bands,
                    especially on the <geogName>Kankakee River</geogName>, and the white settlers added to the
                    winter's fur catch. The peak years of his fur trade were 1851 to 1853.</p>
            <p>Taylor was retired from 1856 to his death in 1892. He took no part in civic or business affairs
                    except to manage his estate. This was probably composed of some farm real estate and rental
                    properties in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was supposed to be modest and appears to have been well distributed and concealed.
                    He was content to be regarded as a survivor of the pioneer days.</p>
            <p>∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗</p>
            <p>Taylor was not the first trader or white resident to locate at the south bend of the <geogName>St.
                        Joseph River</geogName>. Antoine Leclare became the first resident of the <geogName>St. Joseph

                    married an Indian, bought furs, and practiced his blacksmithing trade. About 1791, William Burnett
                    of <placeName>

                    Bertrand in 1808. This was just below the mouth of Pokagon's Branch, near the crossing of
                    the Great Sauk Trail. He married an Indian girl, Madeline, the daughter of the Potawatomi chief,
                    Topenebee. He was the agent of the American Fur Company for a time. He died in <placeName>

                    the next resident of the valley and the first at the south bend of the river. He was sent there in
                    1820 as the agent of the American Fur Company. He remained about a year, sold his agency to Alexis

                    of the <geogName>St. Joseph River</geogName> to establish a trading station, a position similar to

                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> had built a substantial business. Taylor arrived at the south bend on September 25,
                    1827, to establish a trading station for that company, and he soon demonstrated his aptitude.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Taylor followed the system of maintaining a permanent location while supplying agents who traveled to
                    the Indian villages at their own risk. This is best illustrated by a note in the sales book:
                    "Navarre selling the goods to the Pottawatomies. To account to Taylor for the goods at
                    stated prices, but selling them at his own discretion for his profit."<hi rend="sup">12</hi> The station was a retail outlet of a diverse line of merchandise. The first outfit entered
                    in Ledger A, 1827, is that of Edward Smith, copied in Table I. It illustrates the goods stocked by
                    the store, as well as that which was supplied to the Indians. It also illustrates the degree to
                    which the Indians had adopted white people's commodities. There were several pairs of
                    blankets, graded as to quality by "points," probably thickness. List cloth is
                    frequently mentioned in Taylor's invoices but without explanation of its quality or use.
                    The Indians had apparently acquired a preference for cotton clothing and a willingness to sew, as
                    seen from the quantity of calico, shirting, and other cloth carried. There was the usual assortment
                    of decorative objects of high price, but the larger part of the goods was utilitarian.</p>
            <p>Smith was apparently successful in his trading, for his first outfit was supplied in the same winter

                    surprisingly large stock of goods stored in Taylor's little building. The difficulties of
                    transportation required that a business whose important seasons were the fall and the spring should
                    stock its shelves during the summer months. Apparently Taylor was able to get only a limited supply

            <p>The amount of the notes and accounts accumulated by the few whites of the area is indicative of
                    pioneer business methods. Accounts were purchases charged to the buyer for future collection. Notes
                    were time payments, usually for six months at ten per cent interest. They could be renewed for
                    years. Notes were used for large purchases and were sometimes used as currency. Drafts on firms were
                    more commonly used for currency, however. Lewis E. Atherton clearly states some of the evils of
                    credit sales by the western merchants,<hi rend="sup">15</hi> and Taylor's Letters and
                    Orders show many attempts to collect bad debts.</p>
            <p>The Indian accounts were small and resulted from Taylor's local trade at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This indicates the wisdom of dealing with the Indians through outfits which assumed
                    the risk of collection. As Taylor's business expanded he sent his own agents in charge of
                    his goods, and the duty of collection then became Taylor's problem. This procedure will be

                    the bands, and the sum paid Navarre was for furs which Taylor could not secure directly from the
                    Indians. It is plain that the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> station had a modest beginning in which it secured the less desirable pelts. It was a
                    beginning, which could be developed by establishing successful relationships with the Indians and
                    their trusted traders, such as Navarre. He was also engaged in trade with the white squatters of the
                    county, and in formulating plans for the future, when treaties would permit white land entries.</p>
            <p>Taylor sent fifteen packs of furs to Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, April 16, 1828. There is no record of the price credited for them or the contents of
                    the packs. This may have been the amount of furs accumulated to that time since later accounts show
                    that April and May were the months in which the winter's business was concluded.</p>
            <p>It is very difficult to assemble a satisfactory valuation of Taylor's goods, due to the
                    variation in quality. In 1841 the store carried thirteen grades of red flannel. The prices paid for
                    furs depended on many factors: the season when the animal was taken, the expertness of
                    "dressing" the skin,<hi rend="sup">16</hi> and finally the bargaining abilities of
                    the hunter.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> The price received by the hunter was affected by the number of
                    times his product paid a middleman's commission. The outfit secured the pelt and sold it to
                    the permanent station, which in turn sent it to the parent station and received credit. Then it was
                    resold to the American Fur Company, which transported it to the eastern markets for sale and
                    processing. Taylor later eliminated two of these steps by sending out his own outfits and selling
                    directly to the American Fur Company. This gave him opportunity to make a larger profit, offer
                    higher initial prices, or sell at a lower figure. In return he assumed the risks of theft, accident,
                    competition, and fluctuating prices. His position while agent restricted his methods of buying and
                    marketing. He was quite dependent on the main station at Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>

                    whisky from January to November, 1828. There were no purchases of whisky during July and August.
                    Several men bought small quantities at regular intervals, others occasional large quantities. The
                    latter were usually men whose names are also given as agents to the Indian bands at a distance from
                    the station. After Taylor became a partner of Hanna and in control of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> store, there were no sales of whisky directly to Indians.</p>
            <p>It is interesting to conjecture on other purposes which Hanna may have had in starting this station.
                    The treaties of 1821 to 1832 with the Potawatomi and Miami made them less accessible to the Fort <placeName>

                        Indiana.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> The part he played in the founding of the new town may have been
                    determined before he selected the site for his branch trading post, and he may deserve a great deal
                    of credit for foreseeing the strategic position of the site.</p>
            <p>Taylor's books are not satisfactory for the winter of 1828-1829. Monease (Monis) and
                    Sanscomb took outfits to the Indians in November and settled their accounts in April. The goods were
                    valued at $403.30.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> The invoice of goods at the station was valued
                    at $1,356 on May 23, 1829.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> This total is only slightly less than
                    that of the inventory of 1828, and the volume of business in the two seasons was probably about the

            <p>The Chandonnia outfit was charged with $588.33 in trade goods and Indian accounts,

            <p>The stock of goods for the next season was not yet purchased, so that Taylor's credit was
                    probably at its maximum. The debits were undoubtedly for goods purchased to replenish stocks during
                    the winter season and not yet deducted from Taylor's credit balance. Cyrus Taber had gone
                    to <placeName>

            <p>The credit extended to whites had decreased from the amount of 1828. The logical explanation is that
                    Taylor found collection difficult and attempted to limit credit sales. He could depend on his
                    familiarity with the settlers of the area after a three-year period. He did not abandon credit
                    sales, as later inventories show.</p>

            <p>Beaver skins were not a part of the fur trade of Indiana in 1830, and Taylor did not have an
                    opportunity to secure them. Deer, raccoon, and bear skins were still secured in large quantities. Of
                    the total value $915.12 was from bear and deer alone. This does not account for the
                    complete take of the season, as it does not include muskrat. The most significant features of this
                    list of furs is that it appears to be a transaction made directly between the American Fur Company
                    and Taylor, and that the less desirable varieties of skins were discounted five per cent.</p>
            <p>Taylor did not record previous fur sales in this manner. He may have been instructed to ship these

                    study of the "Gebo affair."</p>
            <p>A part of the original area of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> was obtained by Taylor from Peter Gebo (Jebo, Geboo) in 1830.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
                    There is no detailed account of the transaction, but the Taylor books give enough information to
                    stimulate speculation. This was undoubtedly one of Taylor's most important business
                    transactions and most profitable. It has a definite influence on the future settlement of northern
                    Indiana. Hanna and Company Ledgers A and B are the only ones showing accounts with Gebo. The time
                    extended from October 20, 1828, to April, 1830.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> In this period Gebo was
                    debited $189.10 and credited with the same amount. Credits consisted chiefly of ear
                    wheels, earbobs, and broaches brought to Taylor and repair of the same kind of articles. March 24,
                    1828, he sold Taylor four hundred pairs of earbobs. There are other similar entries. It appears
                    probable that he was a minor agent to the local Indian bands, but there were no fur transactions.
                    The most important items in the Gebo account are the whisky debits and the demand note for
                    $48.33 by which the account was balanced August 14, 1829. There is no clear record of the
                    original transaction by which Taylor secured the title from Gebo.</p>
            <p>Gebo bought the following whisky from Taylor during the eighteen-months period: 8 pints, 13 quarts, 1
                    gallon, 20 bottles—pint and quart—and 4 pints of wine. This was not a great
                    amount when compared to that purchased by some white individuals and may have been for his own
                    business. There is no trace of Gebo in the records after the compromise was reached with Elisha B.
                    Harris in 1832.</p>
            <p>Taylor was given financial backing by the partners of Hanna and Company as he and Coquillard laid out
                    the new town site on March 8, 1831,<hi rend="sup">34</hi> and made the necessary donations to
                    attract support.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> After the project had progressed through its preliminary
                    stages and considerable money had been expended, Taylor's claim was disputed and he was
                    unable to get title from the government. Finally a compromise <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> and became a partner in the local store. A brief comparison with the spring inventory
                    of 1828 shows: the store had made considerable expansion in goods stocked; the yearly credit with
                    Hanna was more than doubled; there were now several sources of wholesale supply in addition to Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, and credit extension was becoming large. A more detailed examination of this inventory
                    can be made. The silverworks on hand were for use in earbobs, broaches, arm bands, and other
                    trinkets. Taylor sold these to the Indians. He also bought other trinkets from them after they had
                    added their own workmanship. Gebo collected these trinkets by the hundreds for sale to Taylor and
                    was hired to repair many of them. Taylor then resold the silverworks to Indians of other villages.

            <p>The inventory lists about one-half of the white accounts as "bad." These were
                    probably cases where credit was given to people who then migrated without leaving any clue to the
                    new address. It is evident from his letters and orders that Taylor traced many delinquent debtors to
                    various parts of Indiana, <placeName>

                    manner by the government agents. Taylor was later called upon to prove some of his Indian accounts
                    and could not do so but this occurred only once, and the incident is explained in connection with
                    General William B. Mitchell's report of September 1, 1840. Taylor had forwarded sufficient
                    merchandise to Hanna to build up a credit of $2,670.65 by July 30, 1831. He purchased
                    $3,053.10 in new goods from Hanna the next month to begin the fall season with a balance
                    in the home company's favor. The other purchases were of articles which Hanna could not

            <p>The most important influence on Taylor's business career was the increased white population
                    due to the sale of public lands begun in 1830. This would alter his lines of merchandise and
                    products secured in exchange. The whites required many articles which he had not stocked for the
                    Indian trade, their products would likewise be more diversified. Taylor required a larger stock of
                    goods, more sources of supply, and more markets.</p>

            <p>Even if Lew Wallace had not been a most vital and interesting personality in his own right, the
                    recent popularity of fictional treatments of the life of Christ would warrant our taking another
                    look at the most celebrated writer of this genre upon our shores.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi rend="i">Ben Hur</hi> was only one incident. The challenge posed by Wallace's
                    crowded and eventful life is to find the motivating force, the source of the intense drive behind
                    his varied career. To discover that force, the first step was to seek out his old haunts, explore
                    the physical surroundings of his base of operations, and interview his surviving friends and
                    neighbors. The next step was to examine the readily available materials on his life including his
                    unfinished posthumous autobiography and look for a common denominator of motivation in the events
                    and actions. It also was helpful to find Wallace's own brief unpublished manuscript
                    biography of his wife which contains some revealing passages about its author.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are still residents of Wallace's home town of Craw-fordsville, Indiana, who recall the
                    old gentleman with the oddly thrust forward mustache and beard. They remember his stiff military
                    bearing and his imposing appearance on Sunday morning striding up the steps of the Methodist church
                    wearing the dark, broad-brimmed fedora of a Union veteran with a full, white-lined cloak flowing and
                    swirling off his rigid shoulders.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They see him as he sat under his favorite shade tree in the summer months clad in cool white linens
                    or pongee, or perched on the board fence that bounded his property fighting the Civil War all over
                    again with the town's G.A.R. pensioners. They tell how he would become so carried away by
                    his critique of the old campaigns that he would forget meal times, and <list type="footnotes">

            <p>It is difficult for these observers to be entirely dispassionate about Wallace. They tend to think of
                    him as an institution rather than a person. As far back as they can recall, he was the
                    town's first citizen and chief celebrity. Not many knew him well—he had few
                    intimates—and an aura of idealization compounded of local pride and a convention of <hi rend="i">nihil nisi bonum</hi> obscures the real man. Glimpses of a human Wallace appear only
                    from time to time. An old acquaintance recollects with a chuckle how horrified she was to hear the
                    General curse with eloquent and resounding oaths "after writing so beautifully about the
                    life of Christ." Another recalls his forthrightness on the subject of the bicycle craze.
                    "Monkeys on wheels!" he would snort.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some hold that Wallace was aloof, others speak of the affable nods he would bestow all around when he
                    dropped into Muhleisen's saloon for a pick-me-up. Close neighbors agree that, however
                    reserved he might have been to others, he was most gracious to them and most hospitable. The
                    wicker-wrapped bottle was always at hand ready for the refreshment of visiting comrades-in-arms.
                    Wallace had an engaging enthusiasm for showing callers about his estate, calling attention to items
                    of interest with sweeping gestures and discoursing the while with just the faintest suggestion of
                    the cicerone.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One somber note is present in these recollections of Wallace and that is <placeName>

            <p>With respect to Susan E. Wallace one finds less reticence. Her admirers are alert and on the

                    daughter of the house soon to be married. "No, thank you," said Mrs. Wallace,
                    "I have seen the glories of the earth." While generally "all buttoned
                    up," as a neighbor describes her, Mrs. Wallace had expansive moments. At times, she was
                    given to enigmatic utterances and darkly poetic turns of phrase. To a visitor who admired her
                    garden, she observed in a far-away voice, "beautiful, yes, but the trail of the serpent is
                    all about it."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>But Lew Wallace lived too long ago to be recreated satisfactorily from the recollections of those who
                    knew him only in his old age. He was born in 1827, and one should, therefore, look at the events of
                    his life. He had no real calling but was an amateur, at times a singularly gifted one, of half a
                    dozen professions.</p>
            <p>He is best known as a novelist, the author of the long-time best-seller, <hi rend="i">Ben Hur; A Tale
                        of the Christ</hi>, published by Harpers in 1880. Less popular was his earlier work, <hi rend="i">The Fair God</hi> (1873), a fictional treatment of Hernando Cortez's conquest
                    of Mexico based primarily on W. H. Prescott's historical account. Less successful also was
                    the later novel, <hi rend="i">The Prince of <placeName>
                            <country reg="ii">India</country>
                        </placeName>; or Why Constantinople Fell</hi> (1893). Wallace described himself as
                    "extremely literary" in the memoir of his wife, but writing was only one of many

                    lawyer." There was no very pressing economic need for him to pursue the profession
                    actively. His wife's family was well-to-do and when his father-in-law, Major Elston, died
                    in 1867, he left "a handsome inheritance for his family."<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>Wallace acquired an interest in politics from his father, although he himself never achieved an
                    elective public office higher than state senator (1856). He was raised a Whig, became a Democrat,
                    and in 1860 "took a walk" from the Democratic into the Republican camp. It was a

                    in charge of raising the state's first quota of regiments and was given command of the

                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>

                    day's engagement, and Grant publicly criticized his judgment. Wallace was deeply hurt by
                    this criticism and years later he wrote to his wife of "the old wound at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName>," a wound to the spirit.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Around the edges of these varied careers Wallace found time to play the violin and to paint pictures
                    and model in clay.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> In the biography of Mrs. Wallace he wrote confidently of
                    this phase, "In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>… Gen. Wallace and his wife have made their home, lovely without, delightful

            <p>In summarizing the events of Lew Wallace's life in this way, one notes he dabbled in
                    literature, the law, politics, war, and the arts. Yet he shied away from complete commitment to any
                    one of these professions. He was always seeking something further, something beyond what these
                    interests were capable of providing. One sees also an essential paradox between Wallace the dreamer
                    of dreams and Wallace the man of decisive action.</p>
            <p>It has been said that there is a little group of students of American history ready to
                    support—but only "off-the-record"—a tenuous but alluring
                    thesis on the state of mind contributing to the Civil War. These hold that a potent psychological
                    factor in the readiness of the South to embark upon the tragic and unnecessary struggle was the
                    strength of the appeal in that section of romantic fiction, particularly the Waverly Novels of

            </p>
            <p>Wallace had a very real flair for the dramatic which he could use to point up the significance of an
                    occasion. On the eve of departure for war he staged a brief public ceremony for the Eleventh
                    Indiana. Before a great crowd of spectators Wallace commanded every man in the regiment to fall upon
                    his knees, raise his right hand and while the onlookers stood hushed, swear a mighty oath to
                    remember the humiliation of the Indiana forces at Buena Vista in the Mexican War and wipe out that
                    shame in battle.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The romantic tendency can also be noted in Wallace's painting of the conspirators plotting
                    the assassination of Lincoln. The conspirators are shown in a range of poses from furtive to poetic
                    before a classical ruin, a favorite stage property of the age which revolted against the logic and
                    reason of classicism.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again one finds the love of the colorful in his description of his friend the Turkish Sultan Abdul
                    Hamid II. "The commander of the faithful wears the uniform of an army officer, without
                    ornament other than a slight dress-sword. His bearing is kingly, his face thin and colorless, eyes
                    black and keen as a falcon's. He rides a milk-white Arabian, which he manages with skillful

                    parading about in picturesque costume, as totally spontaneous and not selfconscious. It is clear
                    from the record that Wallace kept one eye firmly on the realities as they applied to his own career.
                    While Wallace enjoyed romance for its own sake, he possessed above all a romantic yearning for
                    immortal fame. This was the driving force that carried him from interest to interest, made his
                    successes so sweet, his failures so bitter, and caused him to put the best front on his achievements
                    before he had actually become famous.</p>
            <p>His autobiography is very enlightening on this point. Wallace stated that he saw the Civil War coming
                    and knew that it would be not only a long and bitter conflict but "that it would also be
                    crowded with opportunities for distinction not in the least inconsistent with
                        patriotism."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> This yearning for fame is also set forth in so many
                    words in Wallace's unpublished biographical sketch of his wife. He writes,
                    "probably no man, in his efforts to achieve renown, was ever better seconded by his wife
                    than General Wallace."</p>
            <p>The same memoir, which is more concerned with Mrs. Wallace's husband than with the lady
                    herself, acquaints one with the man's own estimate of his accomplishment before <hi rend="i">Ben Hur</hi> made him an international literary figure. "Her husband has had a
                    notable career, and achieved distinction in other lands beside our own. He has a permanent place in
                    history as a soldier; while in literature he is everywhere known as author of 'The Fair
                    God.'"</p>
            <p>Wallace's preoccupation with immortality in history explains the overwhelming importance
                    that Grant's censure took in his mind. <placeName>

                    northern reaches of the upper Great Lakes. Under the pressure of the Iroquois from one direction and
                    the Sioux from the other, the tribes began to move southward. The advent of the white man to this
                    region found the Potawatomi on either side of Lake <placeName>

            <p>After the Treaty of Greenville of 1795, to which they had been a party, the Potawatomi,
                    notwithstanding the protests of the Miami who maintained the whole region to be theirs, announced
                    their intent to move into the upper <geogName>Wabash River</geogName> region. Less than a decade
                    later they were in possession of territory around lower Lake <placeName>

            <p>Until 1763, the Potawatomi had been assiduously attached to the French, and their role in the
                    so-called "Pontiac's conspiracy" of 1763 was conspicious. During the
                    American Revolution, their hostilities were directed against the Americans, and they continued to
                    thus array themselves until 1795. Again, in the War cf 1812, the Potawatomi sided with the British.</p>

            <p>The daily "Journal of an Emigrating Party of Pottawatt-omie Indians, 1838," with
                    entries from August 30 through November 10, 1538, is printed in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                        History</hi>, XXI (1925), 315-336, from a copy made by Jesse C. Douglass, enrolling agent. A

                        <settlement type="city">La Porte</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, is a continuation of that journal through December 4, 1838. The handwriting
                    of the first and of that herein printed are not of the same scribe. Neither is written by Polke. The
                    latter apparently was dictated to or kept by a scribe, secretary, or some other member of the
                    emigration. While the orthography and capitalization are unpredictable and erratic, the eight pages
                    of manuscript are quite readable.</p>
            <p>The words printed through which a white line is drawn were crossed out in the original manuscript.

                        <p>It is known to you that volunteers to prevent difficultees between the Pottowotimy
                                    Indians &amp; our own Citizens 100 volunteers were ordered into service by the
                                    Govr of Indiana,<hi rend="sup">29</hi> no doubt was entertaned that they woud effect
                                    a removal of the Indians and as the volunteers were on thier march to the Indian
                                    village I was requested to accept the appointment of conductor shoud thiere be an
                                    Emigration not one day not an hour was left me to examin your instruction or forms I
                                    entered the service and in three days had the management of between seven &amp;
                                    eight hundred Indians my Clerks &amp; all assistents were to select nether
                                    disburseing officer of money except that furnished on the credit or from the pocket
                                    of a private citizen.</p>
                        <p>The volunteers acted as common labourers in hauling Indian Poneys collecting thier
                                    other property &amp; doing camp duty. These men were (many of them) of the first
                                    citizens of the State they refused to use the Indian ration. Bread bacon, Tea coffee
                                    &amp; sugar were purchased for thier use and forrage for thier horses.</p>
                        <p>I have never yet been furnished with a copy of the contract for transportation. The
                                    contractors believing that no Emigration woud be got up had no wagons ready until
                                    hundreds of Indians were reday to move they then hired some all the wagons and I was
                                    compelled to hire wagons to transport sick Indians the first 5 days of our march I
                                    hired wagons every day &amp; paid them off in a day or two or as soon as others
                                    could be procured I find by examining the roll which I send you to day that I have
                                    discharged ten wagons that have rendered service for short periods, to day I will

                                    transportation abandoned their contract &amp; I have entered into a contract

                        <p>Two days since, one of the principal chiefs, I-o-weh, who has assisted and taken an
                                    active part in forwarding the present emigration of the Pottawattamie Indians, was
                                    found to be without his horses, they having strayed away from the encampment. It was
                                    thought that to compel him to walk among those over whom he exercises such supreme
                                    control might prove unpopular to the cause of the emigration, and be the cause of
                                    such serious discontent as to effect much the ends and objects of the government, so
                                    far as his connection with his people might be brought to bear upon this and cases
                                    of a like character.—A horse, for which the Disbursing Officer paid
                                    $62.50, was accordingly purchased and given to him.</p>
                        <p>I have to hope that you will see the necessity of the course which has been adopted.
                                    I-o-weh has lately been zealously engaged in assisting the Officers of the
                                    government in the collection of the Indians, and aiding all in his power to bring
                                    about the present Emigration.</p>

                                    officers and teams attached to the party.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It affords me pleasure to say that the emigration has been conducted and finally
                                    concluded with the greatest promptitude. Not an unpleasant circumstance occurred
                                    during the whole of the journey, to affect the character or retard at all the
                                    progress of the party. All went off, and was settled with that harmony and good
                                    nature, which was and is best calculated to subserve the interests of government.</p>
                        <p>By the Journal you will observe that the Indians after arriving at their homes,
                                    preferred complaints against government for its non-performance of the stipulations
                                    of the treaties concluded with them for their removal west. Houses have not been
                                    built for them—lands have not been cultivated. They murmur at this, and
                                    perhaps with propriety. I would respectfully suggest that the promises made them
                                    both by government and Gen. <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                                    </placeName>, in regard to the improvement of their homes in the west, receive early
                                    attention. Such course may prevent future trouble and perhaps difficulties.</p>
                        <p>In a day or two, according to a promise extorted from me, I shall return to the
                                    Indians, and remain with them until the return of Mr Davis, the Agent, whose absence
                                    I have earlier neglected to notice. In consequence of Mr D's absence, the
                                    Indians have not yet been formally delivered.</p>
                        <p>During my stay with the Indians, I shall do all in my power to harmonize their
                                    feelings, and hope that the Department will see the necessity of an immediate
                                    compliance with its promises.</p>

                    because Slocum evidently used a free hand in editing the letter. One curious change, which either
                    Curtis or Slocum made, is the substitution of the word "Aborigines" for
                    "Indians"' in many places. Additions in the letter to Witherell are
                    indicated where they occur in the letter to <placeName>

                    locate the original manuscript of the letter to Witherell, if it still exists, so Indiana is the
                    richer for having the letter to <placeName>

                        <p>As our difficulties have in some measure subsided, and as I have been so fortunate as
                                    to survive the siege, it affords me the highest satisfaction to have it in my power
                                    to communicate to you some, among many, of the most important occurrences since my

                                    to be highly pleased with the place and my situation, except, perhaps I might have
                                    been better suited with a little more active employment than I have had till about
                                    twenty days past.</p>
                        <p>Nothing worthy of notice has transpired since my arrival here till the 7th Ulto. on

                           <hi rend="sup">11</hi> there were five hundred Indians encamped near the

                                    Kickapoos. The next day, which must have been on the 14th a council was called by
                                    Capts: Heald and Wells in which they used every exertion to persuade the Indians to
                                    let the troops depart in peace: they even agreed to give up all the military arsenal

                                    they consented; and the next morning while the bloodthirsty savages were killing and

                                    and the thirty five Indians with their pack horses bringing up the rear. They had
                                    not passed half a mile<hi rend="sup">12</hi> from their little assylum, when looking
                                    back they discovered the approach of the enemy about four hundred in number, with
                                    their tomahawks raised ready to give the fatal blow. A kind of hollow square was
                                    immidiately formed encompassing the women and children, and one round<hi rend="sup">13</hi> fired at the enemy, but being overpowered by numbers, the brave, the

                                    general shots, when I discouvered, from the flash of their guns, that they were
                                    secreted behind the buildings, fences, and shrubberies at some distance, and I
                                    having command of the musketry below, ordered them to cease firing till further
                                    orders, thinking the enemy would conclud that we were frightened or that we were
                                    tenacious of ammunition, and would probably venture a little nearer. Mr. Ostrander
                                    having charge of the Block rooms, above, as soon as the Indians had collected more
                                    in a boddy, sent a few shells among them which caused them soon to disperse, and we
                                    presume, must have raked the shins of many. Scattering shots were received for the
                                    remainder of the night. They kept up a firing the next day from behind buildings,
                                    fences &amp;c. till about three oclock P.M. in order, we presume, to disturb our
                                    rest, knowing that we had been all night on the alert. But when night<hi rend="sup">25</hi> came we were ready and active. And having heared, of old,
                                    "that caution is the mother of safty" we had the roofs of our
                                    buildings wet, also the pickets on the inside, our water casks all filled and every
                                    bucket and kettle arranged in the most convenient places. We had no apprehensions of
                                    danger except by fire, which they might have sat to the pickets, by creeping up, of
                                    a dark night with a bundle of light combustibles invelloping fire, and got off again
                                    without being discouvered till it had taken. In order therefore, to prevent them
                                    from approaching undiscouvered, to the pickets, I suggested a plan which readily met
                                    the approbation of Mr. Ostrander and others in the garrison and immediately put it
                                    in opperation. I procured from the Factor's Store, about thirty Bells of
                                    the size of a common half pt: tumbler, and collected a sufficient quantity of Bed
                                    cord and other ropes to reach round the garrison, on the outer side, about twelve
                                    feet from the pickets. The cord was stretched on crotches about ten inches from the
                                    ground, and the Bells suspended from it at convenient distances, so that anything
                                    touching the cord at any place round the works would cause the toll of at least two
                                    of Bells.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

                                            would show us what they could do. We answered them that we were ready, and

                                    and others, and was heard several times to exclaim "O my money! if I had

                                    the enemy without, he was the most troublesome and noysy within the garrison. Our
                                    apprehensions from the disorder and confusion he created among the men were our
                                    greatest fears; we had every thing prepared at one time during the siege, to silence

                                    for us) he was apprised by some of his friends, that something of that kind was in

                                    be obliged to surrender, and when told by his subalterns that the first man or
                                    person in the garrison who should offer or propose a surrender to the enemy, at the
                                    approach of no heavier mettal than three pounders, should loose his life, he offered
                                    no resentment, but remained silent on the subject. After the 10th we remained in
                                    tranquillity, but could see frequently large parties of Indians between that time
                                    and the 12th running across the river and the paries [prairies], and many of them
                                    without arms. We were at a loss to determine the cause of this singular movement,
                                    but concluded that they must have seen some movement of an army between this and
                                    Piqua, as they were running from that quarter. About three oclock P M. of the 12th

            <p>By way of introduction and first impression, this is the most beautiful book this reviewer has ever
                    been asked to describe, and in some respects one of the most complicated. It is made up of several
                    features, all essential to the complete work; an excellent introduction by Howard H. Peck-ham,
                    secretary of the Indiana Historical Society; a sketch of "Winter, the Artist," by
                    Wilbur D. Peat; and a biographical sketch by Gayle Thornbrough. Then follow two journals by Winter
                    himself. First, a "Journal of a Visit to Lake Kee-wau-nay and Crooked Creek,
                    1837," and second, "Journal of a Visit to Deaf Man's Village,
                    1839." And throughout, handsome reproductions of Winter's sketches and paintings
                    of Indians and landscapes of their country in Indiana.</p>
            <p>George Winter, the youngest of a large English family, was born near Southampton in 1809. His early
                    education, which included instruction in painting, seems to have been that of the average middle
                    class family of moderate means. Most of his family, including his parents, removed to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> early in the century, but George did not follow for some years, and during the next few
                    years continued in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> his study of painting.</p>
            <p>Winter arrived in America on July 11, 1830, while the press of the country was seething with the
                    controversy precipitated by President Jackson's message to Congress asking for legislation
                    to bring about the removal of the Indians from east of the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> to
                    the west of that stream. A short time before, on May 28, Jackson's Bill was enacted by
                    Congress with a majority of one vote. Winter was thus introduced to a field of interest that was
                    destined to influence his life profoundly. Immediately after the passage of Jackson's Bill,
                    removal of the southern Indians was begun, and before many years most of the Five Civilized Tribes
                    had been removed to the future <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>. During those years negotiations with the Indians east of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> were constantly under way, and the papers were filled with accounts of these
                    activities. Distinguished <pb n="420" id="VAA4025-044-1-096"/> writers visited the Indians and wrote
                    accounts that were published and widely read. Among these was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Irving, who visited the future <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName> in 1832 and wrote absorbing accounts of the Indians that were published in the
                    principal newspapers. In April, 1834, B. H. Coates delivered before the Historical Society of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> an address on the subject, which was widely circulated. On October 24 of the same year
                    a paper entitled "A Discourse on the Surviving Remnant of the Indian Race in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>" was delivered before the Society for the Commemorating of the Landing of
                    William Penn, which was published to the world. In that year, 1834, George Catlin came to the Indian
                    Territory and accompanied the celebrated dragoon expedition to the remote Comanche villages, and
                    during this adventure painted many Indian portraits that became part of the well-known Catlin
                    Collection.</p>
            <p>All these activities greatly interested Winter, who later was influenced to seek opportunities for
                    seeing these Indians and painting them—a scheme which became the great object of his
                    life.</p>
            <p>Winter, in 1835 or 1836, went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> while the people of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> were absorbed with the subject of the removal of the Indians from that state,
                    substantial part of Shawnee, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName>, and Seneca Indians already having removed to the west. During Winter's
                    residence in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, treaty negotiations under way continued to be of paramount interest. Emigrating
                    parties were slowly being organized and started on their way. By 1835 most of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Indians had passed out of that state. Whether this was the reason does not appear
                    positively, but at this juncture Winter removed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, where Indian removal was still a live subject.</p>
            <p>Eighteen treaties had been made with the scattered bands of Potawatomi Indians and spasmodic efforts
                    at organizing and removing parties of this tribe had accomplished little. When Winter came to
                    Indiana, he located at Logans-port which was a sort of center of Potawatomi population. Miami
                    Indians also were collected in that part of the state. Here Winter found himself in his element, and
                    in the surrounding country he did most of his painting and study of the Indians.</p>

                    printer's art, he will be charmed not alone by the overall beauty of the book and the

                    landscapes, but by spritely, absorbing, and authentic accounts of the Indians seen by Winter. But by
                    none more than that of Winter's account of the recent startling discovery of the long lost
                    Frances Slocum, the five-year-old white child, stolen by the <placeName>

                    member of the Miami tribe of Indians, the mother of grown Indian daughters. The reader will be
                    touched by the reply of the captive to her brother Joseph, of Wilkes-Barre, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>

                    'I cannot, I cannot,' she said; 'I am an old tree, I cannot move about; I
                    was a sapling when they took me away. It is all gone past. I am afraid I should die and never come
                    back. I am happy here. I shall die here and lie in that graveyard, and they will raise the pole at
                    my grave, and with the white flag on it, and the Great Spirit will know where to find me. I should
                    not be happy with any white relatives. I am glad to see them, but I cannot go. I cannot go. I have
                    done.'"</p>
            <p>One feels a particular sense of obligation to the Indiana Historical Soicety, to the Lilly Endowment,
                    and all others who contributed to the production of this lovely book.</p>

            <p>This is the story of how the Democratic party went to pieces in the period 1856-1860. It is also an
                    attempt to reveal the part which politicians played in bringing on the American Civil War. The
                    author confesses unblushingly that he is writing political history and implies, at least, that he
                    holds the politician responsible for pushing issues beyond settlement by the peaceful democratic
                    process. His thesis is that the American people have left the formulation and execution of policies
                    to political parties and those whom the parties put forward to hold office. So when, in 1860, the
                        <pb n="422" id="VAA4025-044-1-098"/> Democratic party, the last to represent the whole nation,
                    went to pieces and a purely sectional party triumphed, a stalemate developed in government and
                    progress by rational discussion and compromise became impossible. Then men resorted to force.</p>
            <p>The first part of the volume deals with the election of James Buchanan, in 1856, the problems he
                    faced in satisfying the demands of the local groups, and the difficulty of getting anything done
                    amid the press and pull of sectional rivalries. It then centers attention on the
                    "territorial nightmares" that came with <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> which prepared the way for a split in the party and its tragic breakup at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The work is rich in detail. With far better understanding than any previous historian, Professor
                    Nichols traces Buchanan's effort to reorganize the party and to restore its unity and
                    strength. He understands the problems of patronage, the power of money in politics, the influence of
                    weather and hard times and even of religious stirrings on the course of events. His story of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> comes nearer being satisfactory than any yet written. He sees the importance of lands,
                    speculators, adventurers, etc., in the troubles there and reduces slavery to its proper place. He
                    stresses the part which frequent elections had in stirring passions and keeping issues at white
                    heat. He knows that Republicans as well as Democrats were doing little to help the nation and much
                    to strengthen themselves.</p>
            <p>As Professor Nichols tells the story the quarrel between Stephen A. Douglas and the administration
                    was simply the focal point at which an impossible situation headed up. The nation was rushing ahead
                    towards complex interdependence in business and social relationships. The parties, however, were
                    still strictly local units loosely bound together. Economic interests, social values and the
                    fundamental assumptions which men made, not only produced a "federal republic" but
                    a "cultural federalism" as well. Something more than old-fashioned politics was
                    needed to meet the present and to face the future. The politicians of that era could not supply it.
                    They could only play the old game. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in 1860, the Administration forces joined the rabid Southerners against Douglas, while
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> delegation fished in troubled waters for their own selfish benefit. <pb n="423" id="VAA4025-044-1-099"/> Southern radicals left the convention with every expectation of being
                    recalled; the Douglas forces, with equal blindness, refused to seek unity. The last national tie for
                    most Americans thus broke and left no organized body working for the larger national good.</p>
            <p>And while the politicians played their game, the reformers north and south, charged every issue with
                    emotion. Every conflict was a struggle between "right and wrong."
                    "Hyperemotionalism," as Professor Nichols calls it, had prepared men for killing
                    but not for compromise. What the real public opinion was, no one will ever know. There was no way of
                    finding it out and the "blind operators of local political machinery" did not care
                    anyway.</p>

            <p>In this group of collected essays Professor Blegen makes an eloquent plea for the study of
                    America's truly forgotten men, the great undistinguished and simple folk of the past who
                    cleared the nation's first wilderness, plowed its fields, and built it cities. To
                    understand the much troubled and troubling foreign world today, the author argues, the American must
                    first understand himself. But to understand the American present, we must reach back through the
                    perspective of time, back to our very grass roots. And these are to be found not alone in the heroic
                    figures of past politics, battlefields, and polite literature. These are just the frosting, and to
                    get at the real American cake we must go back to the great masses of our immigrant fathers and their
                    sons and daughters, to their day-to-day lives, to their letters, their language, their amusements,
                    and folkways. It is only here that we will find the basic aspirations, prejudices, and assumptions
                    that explain what America was and is. The fundamental supposition upon which this volume rests is
                    that the American culture of today is the product not of the few but of the great masses, and that
                    we have as historians sinfully neglected these unimportant individuals who made an important many.
                    "The pivot of history," Professor Blegen <pb n="424" id="VAA4025-044-1-100"/>
                    writes, "is not the uncommon but the usual, and the true makers of history are
                    'the people yes.'"</p>
            <p>Upon the basis of the above assumptions, the author defends the study of regional and social history
                    against all comers. The charge so often made that regional and social history are provincial, he
                    says, arose from an inverted sense of what was important. "It rejected the near-at-hand as
                    local and insignificant" and "this cultivated the far-away without fully
                    understanding it because it did not understand the near at hand, without sensing too, that the far
                    away may in its inner meaning be near-at-hand." Therefore, in this search for the real
                    American past, the author argues, there is little that is too insignificant to pass by without
                    careful scrutiny. Catalogues of folk sayings, proverbs, dances, and even lists of cooking utensils,
                    textiles, and household wares may all be important to the quest.</p>
            <p>Having made this plea, Professor Blegen then presents a series of extremely interesting essays on
                    immigration and middle western regional history by which he seeks to prove his points. Included are
                    studies of immigrant songs, a field in which the author is an expert, immigrant letters, guidebooks,
                    and the contributions to frontier life by women and children. Among the essays on the regional side
                    are accounts of the fashionable travel on the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, of the first setting down of the Sioux language, of early life in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Paul</settlement>
                    </placeName> and St. Anthony as revealed in newspaper advertisements, and of frontier libraries. The
                    abstracts from an unprinted diary of Charles Francis Adams, Jr., written as he accompanied his
                    father on a stumping tour of the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> country during the campaign of 1896, seem to fall without the structure of the book.</p>
            <p>All of the included essays, many of which have been printed elsewhere, are extremely well-written and
                    highly entertaining. But one wonders at times whether some of them are really good ammunition for
                    the author's stated objective. There is no question about the historical interest of the
                    immigrant songs, for example. But what of their historical significance? Beyond the feelings of
                    local patriotism, loneliness, and occasional despair, what do they tell us about these long ago
                    folks? After all, did they sing them to register their real feelings or simply to give vent to their
                    desire for melody? In this light are they any more significant <pb n="425" id="VAA4025-044-1-101"/>
                    for their generation than the crooner's banal words of today are for ours?</p>
            <p>But this is democratic history. And in an age where the importance of the so-called
                    superman—whether he be the dictator, general, atomic scientist, or the college
                    administrator—is continually emphasized, these essays are a salutary influence. More than
                    that, they are sometimes a pointed answer to the Pareto's doctrine of the elite and
                    Toynbee's creative few. If we are to preserve democracy, we must respect it, and there is
                    no better way to obtain a brimming respect for the institution than to look at the whole of the
                    American past as Professor Blegen has done.</p>

            <p>The story of Lincoln's efforts to become a congressman, for which there had been no adequate

                    </placeName> was overwhelmingly Democratic; in the thirties Lincoln was in the minority as a Whig
                    member of the legislature. In all <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, though there were perhaps two other districts where a Whig might have a sporting
                    chance, there was only one "Whig stronghold"— the centrally located
                    seventh congressional district. It was a coveted prize to get the party nomination from that
                    district, and sometime in the winter of 1842-1843 Lincoln resolved to work hard for it. The idea
                    that Lincoln lacked ambition is simply one of those misconceptions that cluster around this
                    half-understood figure.</p>
            <p>Having shown this ambition, along with conditioning factors in state and district politics, Riddle
                    gives a detailed account of Lincoln's determined nomination drive. The treatment of this
                    phase involved the story of the "Whig junto" of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the delicate adjustment between three friendly rivals—Abraham Lincoln, John
                    J. Hardin, and Edward D. <pb n="426" id="VAA4025-044-1-102"/> Baker, all of whom were to meet
                    violent deaths—, maneuvers in the party nominating convention (a new device), personal
                    solicitation, and discreet use of every trick in the party game. Lincoln's chief obstacle
                    was the able and popular Hardin, against whom, but in a manner "scrupulously
                    fair," he applied the rule "Turn about is fair play." That Hardin
                    withdrew after striving for another term, and that Lincoln was nominated, are evidences of the
                    prairie lawyer's successful strategy, persistence, and timing.</p>
            <p>In the campaign Lincoln had to contend with the rugged and popular preacher, Peter Cartwright, and
                    strangely enough, he had to live down the accusation that he was "the candidate of pride,
                    wealth, and aristocratic family distinction." There was little in that contest that was
                    highly inspiring, but that belongs to the nature of the subject, and to the author's
                    faithful, unexaggerated reporting. It is pointed out, truly enough, that this and that subject were
                        <hi rend="i">not</hi> the "issues" of the campaign. <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> question had been settled by diplomacy; Whigs and Democrats were alike in favoring the
                    newly begun Mexican War so far as this congressional election was concerned; Lincoln even made a
                    "war speech" (pp. 169-170); both parties opposed abolitionism. (It was later that
                    Lincoln courageously contended that the launching of the Mexican War had been unjustified.) If the
                    tariff was an issue, it is doubtful how many votes in agricultural <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> were influenced in the Whig sense by that factor. After all, the story of the contest
                    boils down, not to issues, but to politics, parties, and personalities. One of the uninspiring
                    factors was the "whispering campaign" in which the effort was made to brand
                    Lincoln as an infidel. His convincing published answer, neglected until recently, is one of the
                    important documents bearing upon his attitude toward religion.</p>
            <p>In the election, Lincoln's plurality over Cartwright was 1,511; in the balloting he came off
                    much better than his Whig predecessors, Hardin in 1843 and Baker in 1844. Not only did this election
                    give him his sole national elective office prior to the presidency; his experience as leader in a
                    minority party—his strategy, tact, and maneuvers in that capacity— were a part
                    of his background as minority President. It should also be noted that in his Whig days he labored in
                    a party whose Southern connections were always of primary importance.</p>

            <p>It is a satisfaction to read the Riddle volume. With its close examination of sources, readable

            <p>Despite the limitation imposed by the title, this first book-length study of Thomas Gage (c.
                    1719-1787) is the nearest thing to a biography we are ever likely to see. Though the details of
                    Gage's early life remain somewhat meager, Dr. Alden has used the Gage Papers at the
                    Clements Library exhaustively, the family papers from Firle Place, Sussex, and the manuscripts of
                    many of Gage's contemporaries. His knowledge of the printed sources on American colonial
                    history is extensive, as has been demonstrated in his earlier work, <hi rend="i">John Stuart and the
                        Southern Colonial Frontier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The general who emerges from this intensive examination is a man of competence, moderation, good
                    sense, and considerable penetration. If he was not in advance of his time as a thinker on
                    imperialistic affairs, he was far from being an oppressive reactionary. But he almost constantly
                    occupied an embarrassing or impossible position. Gage was continually bossed by willful and
                    uncomprehending ministers who expected him to enforce their stupid policies, and by giving him
                    discretionary power hoped to evade responsibility if those policies backfired. Gage was not to be
                    caught in such traps and countered by insisting that ministers should make up their minds and
                    deliver him orders.</p>
            <p>He accurately assessed the problem of protecting the newly won West in 1763, but a dilatory and
                    changing cabinet came to no decision until 1768. After war began, he sat tight in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> because he was expected to subdue a rebellion with too few troops, but he suggested at
                    the outset the only alternatives to defeat: a naval blockade of the <pb n="428" id="VAA4025-044-1-104"/> colonies, or an army equal in size to the rebel forces. When he
                    returned to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> late in 1775, after twenty years of service in America, the author declares
                    "it was his hard lot simultaneously to be abused by his American enemies and to be deserted
                    by his compatriots." Dr. Alden's summary analysis of the man forms a splendid
                    commentary on colonial politics.</p>
            <p>The author's interpretation of Gage includes correction of an earlier belief that he acted
                    on his own initiative in ordering his troops to march to Concord in April, 1775. Gage's
                    great popularity in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, his headquarters for ten years, is made known, and it is denied that he accepted any
                    interest in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Company. Alden takes issue with a more recent characterization of Gage's power
                    and position in America as that of a viceroy. And in marking that Gage accurately prophesied what
                    would be required to subdue the Americans, the author labels him "the Cassandra of the
                    first British empire."</p>
            <p>Dr. Alden's style shows great improvement, perhaps because the book was not written for a
                    faculty committee. The new volume is highly readable. It has pace, smoothness, variety, and flashes
                    of humor. There are enough footnotes to satisfy the most scrupulous scholar—rather more
                    than might be expected after the author's declaration against making "a fetish of
                    documentation." The book can be recommended to other investigators who have thought of
                    preparing biographies of eighteenth-century characters. <placeName>

            <p>One of our prominent social historians has observed that in dealing with agricultural history
                    "there seems to be no substitute in first-class historical analysis for a high degree <pb n="429" id="VAA4025-044-1-105"/> of familiarity with the homely and intimate experiences of the
                    specific… period." If this is true there seems to be evidence that much of our
                    existing history of American agriculture suffers from this lack. In fact one can almost say that
                    many of the histories of farming were written without consideration of the farmer or the immediate
                    influences that surrounded him. With rare exceptions, one is left with the impression that new
                    crops, new farm animals and new types of machinery, just sprang into being and the factors or
                    agencies that motivated the farmer to accept these new ideas were ignored.</p>
            <p>This monographic study has not neglected some of these agencies of diffusion. The author's
                    purpose is to show the influences of various forms of agricultural literature on actual practices
                    upon the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> farmer during the first seventy years of the nineteenth century. Although he has
                    limited his study to the farmers of this state, the work will have a wider significance, for what
                    happened in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> was fairly typical of that which occurred in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as a whole. He makes no effort to cover all the agricultural agencies that came in
                    contact with the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> farmer, and he recognizes the influence of others such as the local and state fairs and
                    agricultural societies. He has, however, left them for a future study.</p>
            <p>Dr. Bardolph begins with a lengthy chapter devoted to the rise of books on husbandry, tracing the
                    evolution in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, with some account of English and continental antecedents. This was necessary since
                    these European publications served as the basis for agricultural knowledge in America for some
                    years. Following this chapter on books of husbandry, there are five more which are largely concerned
                    with the rise, together with an analysis of the content of the agricultural instruction provided in
                    the newspapers, advertising circulars, published proceedings and transactions of societies, and the
                    farm periodicals of the state. Much space is given throughout the study to leading personalities and
                    their works of the period, both within and without the state.</p>
            <p>The author has analyzed carefully the growth, as well as the content of these various publications.
                    From a selection of over three hundred various newspapers he found that about one-fourth carried
                    regular columns on farm life. The nature of the materials evolved with the years; in the early phase
                    of the journals they were apt to publish mostly the writings and <pb n="430" id="VAA4025-044-1-106"/> essays of "gentleman farmers, ministers, physicians, and other professional men, and the
                    general tone… was somehow detached and stilted." As the farm journals, however,
                    became more democratic, shedding their dilettante claptrap, they extended their range of interests
                    to actual farming practices and problems touching the farmer on the lowest levels. The columns were
                    never entirely free of such things as fads, frauds, and humbugs or of some lost cause that they were
                    advocating at the time. They periodically campaigned for some social or moral reform that may today
                    seem ludicrous. It must not be overlooked, however, as is noted in this book, that several of these
                    rather fantastic ideas came into reality because of the advocacy of these early journals. The death
                    rate of these publications was high; their span of life frequently running no longer than a few
                    months with but two or three managing to survive until the present time.</p>
            <p>The task of assessing the precise influence of these journals on actual farming practice was the
                    author's principal problem. It is in this phase of social history that the real test of
                    value presents itself. With the techniques now available to the author of this work, or to any
                    social historian as far as that is concerned, it is not possible to come to any very precise
                    conclusions. About all the author was able to say when evaluating the contributions of a particular
                    paper or book was that the "proportion of farmers who were influenced by it can not have
                    been large. Yet, to dismiss its importance it is to despise the day of small things."</p>
            <p>It seems to the reviewer that upon this problem of evaluation the future of social history must rest.
                    At the present time any one working in this field is handicapped by the inadequacies of the
                    available methodology. Those who glean the facts from the historical sources have done well, but
                    what to do with them and how to evaluate precisely the causal effects, is the task of the social
                    historian if his studies are to be of any importance to those who depend upon historical data. For
                    example, when a farmer changed his methods of reaping, adopted a new plow, or introduced a new
                    variety of seed, was this innovation due to "book learning" on his part or was it
                    the result of some form of social interaction? The anthropologist was up against a similar problem
                    some years ago; he roamed over rather large areas collecting data, describing and cataloguing facts
                    pertaining to early man and drawing his conclusions and generalizations on the basis of this type of
                        <pb n="431" id="VAA4025-044-1-107"/> study. But it was not until he changed his approach in the
                    form of a more detailed study of a limited area that he was able to gain the recognition that the
                    science of the study of man has now attained. The reviewer is only posing this problem that if
                    social history, such as is found in this monograph, is to be of real importance in the understanding
                    of human behavior, past or present, those who write it must develop a more precise method.</p>
            <p>Dr. Bardolph writes with a zeal for the subject and many of his phrases and quotations show a
                    liveliness that make for interesting reading. The monograph is free of errors, is well edited and
                    shows an immense amount of accuracy in dates and references; it literally bristles with footnotes
                    and there is appended an excellent bibliography of prominent American horticultural writers in the
                    period to 1870.</p>

                    into the tribe and who were the founders of the village. The French were chiefly interested in the
                    fur trade, but the fertility of the soil soon led them to agricultural pursuits. At first the
                    Jesuits tried to maintain order alone and then with the aid of troops. Government was extended in

                    the Smithsonian Institution one hundred years previously. These men "made the first

                    monumental. By the same token the subject volume is also monumental for it surpasses any similar

            <p>The volume is well-organized. A preface concisely states the intent of the contents, credits those

                    these accomplishments. Although it would, perhaps, have been out of place in this volume, this
                    chapter could have been expanded considerably to the advantage of all who are interested <pb n="433" id="VAA4025-044-1-109"/> in the history of American Archaeology. The span of time involved in
                    this chapter extends from 1772 when David Zeisberger "made the first record of
                    archaeological sites" in what is now the State of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to the contemporaries of the senior compiler. Many observers and observations were
                    involved in these one hundred seventy-five years, but in spite of the lapse of nearly two centuries
                    it will probably come as a surprise that there are 1,351 entries in the <hi rend="i">Bibliography.</hi> The entries cover all published items dealing with <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> archaeology "except references in newspapers, county and regional histories,
                    and atlases. As a result," in the words of the compilers, "it includes many
                    references of little or no scientific value to the archaeologist." This qualifying
                    statement is no doubt true but the shortcomings inherent within such a complete listing have been
                    largely obviated by Morgan's able comments and evaluations of a major portion of the
                    entries. Had newspaper, atlas, and county history references been listed, the volume would have
                    reached staggering proportions. Their omission was probably wise, but it has been this
                    reviewer's experience that county histories and atlases do often contain worthwhile
                    information, especially in the form of leads to archaeological sites and data derived from local
                    residents at an early date.</p>
