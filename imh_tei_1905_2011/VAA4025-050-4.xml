                    </placeName> increased, the market for art works of all kinds expanded. Museums sprang up, centers
                    of art instruction rose, and public buildings and monuments were constructed throughout the country,
                    broadening the field for painters, sculptors, and architects. The Centennial Exposition of 1876 at <placeName>

                    thereafter it was usual for anyone who could afford it to go to Europe at least once and bring home
                    one or more copies of work of the old masters. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> local painters were also patronized, and homes of means usually displayed one or more

                    especially so. Yet homes of the period though indicating some artistic sense lacked any unified
                    planning to make it effective. Each owner sought to build something that would be the handsomest
                    thing of its kind in the city and at the same time be as nearly unique as possible. Certainly the
                    result was the greatest possible degree of variety and originality. Some houses resembled castles or
                    fortresses, others looked like martin boxes or pyramids. Some seemed all roof, others all gables,
                    and still others appeared to be piles of assorted bay windows. Exterior decorations were glaring and

                    drab and green, and one literally showed all the colors of the rainbow. Cupolas, odd front doors,
                    and roof towers were distributed without much forethought. In the interior it was fashionable to
                    exhibit evidence of an artistic temperament. The young daughter of the household was encouraged to
                    develop her talents, and quantities of her work were on display in the parlors of her home and those
                    of her friends. Such examples were sure to include a magnificent oil painting on velvet, the current

                    twenty-five years the only painter there. There were some who came for brief periods to drift on to
                    other cities, but Cox stayed. His only absence was a short period in the forties when he maintained
                    a studio with John Dunn in <placeName>

                    ability to produce them. His pupils were not numerous; probably the most distinguished among them

                    Coburn, painted in 1883; but his landscape painting continued for several years, and he was invited
                    to send this work to local exhibitions. His painting of "The Old Swimmin'

            <p>Mrs. Lottie Guffin enjoyed considerable success during the 1880's. Her paintings were much

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and some of her pictures were sold abroad. She painted rapidly and conscientiously.
                    Most of her work was sold while still on the easel, so she rarely had any finished ones to show in
                    her studio. Her painting, "Lost," was sold to Mrs. Albert S. White (Julia Cox).<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

                    </placeName>, the "Indiana School of Art," 1877-1879, had closed, probably as a
                    result of hard times,<hi rend="sup">7</hi> although William Forsyth suggested other reasons: that
                    pupils dropped out when they found art was really difficult; that the time was not ripe for the
                    school; that Hoosier art students left for European studios; and that the school lacked solid
                    financial backing.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> In any case it lacked both sufficient pupils and funds to
                    operate and, therefore, closed. But its effect lingered on. A spirit had been awakened. For a time
                    interested students continued to paint in John W. Love's studio under his guidance.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> His skill in drawing, the seriousness with which he regarded artistic
                    endeavor, so inspired his pupils that his influence did not end with his death, June 24, 1880, but
                    carried over from one generation of pupils to another. After his death the little group that had
                    clung so faithfully to their palettes and brushes since the closing of the art school, formed a club
                    which gave them a reason, a time, and place to carry on their work. They called it the
                    Bohé Club, an accidental shortening of "Bohemian" when a painter was
                    told to cut that word in half so he would have space to paint it on the door of their club room. The
                    regular members of this little club were: Frederick A. Hetherington, Thomas E. Hibben, Charles

                    München." The catalog of the exhibit was illustrated with etchings from the
                    originals by the Bohé Club. (Unfortunately, no copies of this catalog appear to be
                    extant.) This Hoosier Colony was composed at first of T. C. Steele and William Forsyth, who were
                    joined later by J. Ottis Adams, Samuel Richards, August Metzner, and Miss Carrie Wolff.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> This occasion was a turning point in the affairs of art, for annual exhibits
                    were held regularly thereafter, and interest was so stirred in local artists and their work that
                    when the Hoosier Colony returned late in the eighties, sufficient patronage was available to insure
                    the permanence of art classes and exhibits. (In the mid-nineties Hamlin Garland first used the term,

                    the artists began to return from Munich, the promise of the decade showed signs of fulfillment.</p>
            <p>Many American painters returning from foreign study settled permanently in the East, but the Hoosier
                    artists returned to Indiana. In Munich, exhibits of the various countries had been shown in special
                    galleries and this national expression of art appealed to the Hoosiers. Why not, they thought, an
                    art of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, or of Indiana? With this common idea, and close association to strengthen it, they
                    worked toward this end. The experience they gained in landscape painting during vacation periods in
                    the towns and villages of southern <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> prepared the Hoosier artists for what was to be their prominent characteristic. They
                    found themselves enthusiastic about returning to Indiana and thought of going no further for
                    material, for they felt that a distinctive school of painting might be developed there.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> What made this thought so revolutionary was the fact that at that time
                    European scenes, whether well or poorly done, were extremely popular in <placeName>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> Hoosier artists had a common background, for all but Metzner had
                    been pupils of Ludwig von Löfftz, a prominent teacher of painting in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> at that time. Local landscape work was not new, for John Love had held sketch classes

                    summers since 1884. These returning artists were to have far-reaching influence on the home
                    community, for they had "gained culture in other ways than study at the academy. The

                    Artists' Club—the latter a common meeting ground for all students, English and

                    spent at Munich. During this time Herman Lieber rendered important assistance to young artists in
                    many ways. As Steele sent paintings back to Lieber, the latter would exhibit them in his gallery,

                    naturally included with theirs in exhibitions, so that he has always been considered as one of the
                    Hoosier Group. Probably his greatest picture was "The Drama of the Elements,"
                    which was purchased by Arthur A. McKain and placed in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Public Library. He was a popular painter and Forsyth suggested that perhaps more of
                    Gruelle's pictures were owned in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    Middle West to recognize and express purely local conditions in their motifs and coloring. One
                    writer commented: "They never fail to delineate the native charm, devoting their time to
                    the problems of light, color, and atmosphere, which has a peculiar fascination in early spring and
                    late autumn. These men never condescend to the general demand on the part of the public for work of
                    a popular nature; they are never accused of debauching public taste."<hi rend="sup">53</hi>

            <p>The Art Association held regular annual exhibits from 1883 to 1897, except in 1884. During those
                    years over one thousand paintings were shown, including a few masterpieces by American and foreign
                    artists. Minor exhibits of etchings, engravings, laces, fabrics, pottery, and casts were shown every
                    year, each exhibit lasting from three days to a week. By 1897, twenty-eight such exhibits had been
                    given, together with six courses of lectures and twenty-four separate talks.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>
                    The annual exhibits were full-dress occasions with musical programs and refreshments. Single
                    admissions were usually twenty-five cents, and for the exhibit in 1887, season punch tickets were
                    sold, twenty admissions for four dollars.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> Although a large annual exhibit was
                    not shown in 1884, as noted above, specimens of the work of some of the pupils were shown and
                        enjoyed.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> In 1885 paintings, etchings, and engravings by Thomas B.
                    Glessing, which were owned by his widow, were featured at the annual exhibit. Included with these
                    were paintings by the actor, Joseph Jefferson.<hi rend="sup">57</hi> It was hoped many pictures
                    could be sold, for only in that way could the annual exhibits be maintained.</p>
            <p>A group of paintings brought from the gallery of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> exposition proved an interesting feature of the showing of 1886. Again it was hoped
                    that some of the pictures would be purchased and remain permanently in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for it was felt that the continual presence of good works of art was the best way to
                    foster this culture. To set an example, the Art Association purchased one of the paintings, executed
                    by Gustave Werthheimer of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>, titled "The Kiss of the Siren."<hi rend="sup">58</hi> This marine
                    picture depicted a beautiful feminine nude amidst the waves luring a boatman to his destruction. The
                    luscious flesh tones of the nude combined with the sea green of the waves to create what current
                    observers felt to be a most entrancing effect. Lengthy descriptions appeared in the newspapers, but
                    the Art Association presently regretted its choice. Sometime after the initial enthusiasm for the
                    painting had diminished, the picture was quietly removed from its place in the gallery and
                    disappeared; where, <list type="footnotes">

                    a cynosure for all who have dwelt or travelled there. At a focal point in the plan of the city from
                    which main arteries of midwestern transportation radiate, the Monument was regarded by those who
                    designed it as the heart of the nation.</p>
            <p>The Circle had always been something of a problem. Early and somewhat unfortunately the site of the
                    Governor's Mansion, it was later suggested as a location for a combined public library and
                    memorial building. For a brief period, 1884-1888, Morton's statue alone graced the Circle.
                    In 1887, Professor H. J. Schonacker in a public address in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> made a plea for a monument to commend the loyalty and services of the soldiers and
                    sailors of Indiana, one that would be a real work of art, for as such it would be an important means
                    of education. As an illustration he reminded his audience that the work of Thomas Nast, cartoonist,
                    had been influential in putting Boss Tweed behind bars. He complained that the statue of Governor
                    Morton did not really do him justice, for the pedestal was too low. Efforts were already in progress
                    to influence the legislature to appropriate $200,000 for a soldiers'
                        monument.<hi rend="sup">79</hi> Shortly a bill was introduced in the legislature specifying that
                    a monument be erected in Circle Park, but not restricting the type of memorial it should be. A
                    writer in the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> felt some apprehension as to what might then become of
                    Morton's statue and suggested that if it must be removed from the Circle, it might be
                    located in University Park.<hi rend="sup">80</hi> Eventually it was decided to incorporate the
                    statue into the monument in the Circle, so it was moved to the southeast corner to represent one of
                    the four periods of Indiana's history, while John Mahoney was commissioned to execute
                    statues of George Rogers Clark, William Henry Harrison,<hi rend="sup">81</hi> and James Whitcomb, to
                    be arranged in the other three corners to commemorate their respective periods of the
                    state's history.</p>

                    within the capabilities of Schmitz, the commission sought the services of Frederick William
                    MacMonnies, the most outstanding sculptor in America at that time. Criticism of the designs he
                    offered caused him to give up his contract; then some persons desired that John Mahoney be given the
                    work, but the latter could not get along with one of the architects, so the work was left for Bruno
                    Schmitz, whose forte was architecture, not sculpture. Apparently, then, Schmitz sought out Rudolph
                    Schwartz, his former pupil in <placeName>

                    agreed with this general statement and further pointed out that Schwartz made the soldier figures
                    which stand at the entrances to the Monument.<hi rend="sup">83</hi> Mary Q. Burnet specifically
                    stated that Schwartz was commissioned, after winning in sharp competition, to do "The
                    Return Home" and "The Dying Soldier" figures just above the cascades, as
                    well as the single soldiers and sailors at the entrances. She also stated that the
                    "War" and "Peace" groups were designed by Herman N. Matzen, and
                    carved by Rudolph Schwartz.<hi rend="sup">84</hi> Anton Scherrer, architect and son of Adolf
                    Scherrer, the State House architect, relates that Herman N. Matzen did the high reliefs of the
                    "Peace" and "War" groups.<hi rend="sup">85</hi> The card
                    describing the Monument and issued by its board of control says simply that Rudolph Schwartz was
                    sculptor of the stone work and George T. Brewster of the bronze work. Thus it is not clear just how
                    much of the designing or execution of sculptural detail was done by Schwartz.</p>
            <p>Preliminary construction was begun on the Monument in 1888, and its thirty-foot-deep foundation was

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>

                    in any case the materializing of the desire to honor our soldier dead is a part of our national
                    growth. Even if too little time and money were given for the best thought and production, it is but

            <p>A modern architect writing of this period declares that in the eighties "our architectural
                    styles were a riot of unrest."<hi rend="sup">92</hi> But such form and pattern as there was
                    may be said to display the Romanesque style which was revived in America after the Centennial
                    Exposition of 1876. The hero of this revival was Henry Hobson Richardson, whose designs were widely
                    imitated throughout the country. The best material for this style was stone, but stucco and terra
                    cotta were both used as substitutes, as well as shingles cut into various patterns. Special features
                    of the Romanesque were rounded arches, rounded towers, and, especially in wooden houses, corner
                    towers and porte cochères. Churches in this style exhibited towers with dome-like cupolas
                    instead of spires. The buildings were square, with the pulpit, organ, and choir tucked into a
                    corner, the floor bowl-shaped, and pews curved. It was the "age of cat-a-corner."
                    Homes often had golden oak floors, woodwork, and furniture, with highly polished varnished finish.

                    favor, but Gothic and classic or French Renaissance were also used. Terra cotta was much in vogue,

                    comfortable houses surrounded by shrubbery and spacious lawns. No apartment houses had yet been
                    constructed, and the number of boarding houses was small. More people owned their homes in the
                    Hoosier capital than in the other cities of the state. By the end of the decade more were being
                    built and a similar increase was noted in the construction of business buildings, while real estate

            <p>"This house was the pride of the town. Faced with stone as far back as the dining-room
                    windows, it was a house of arches and turrets and girdling stone porches: it had the first
                    porte-cochère seen in that town. There was a central ‘front hall’
                    with a great black walnut stairway, and open to a green glass skylight called the
                    ‘dome,’ three stories above the ground floor. A ballroom occupied most of the
                    third story; and at one end of it was a carved walnut gallery for the musicians. Citizens told
                    strangers that the cost of all this black walnut and wood-carving was sixty thousand dollars. Sixty
                    thousand dollars for the wood-work <hi rend="i">alone!</hi> Yes, sir, and hardwood floors all over

                    upstairs and down, and stationary washstands in every last bedroom in the place! Their
                    sideboard's built right into the house and goes all the way across one end of the dining
                    room. It isn't walnut, it's solid mahogany! Not veneering—solid

                    coupé, run-a-bout, or other vehicles. The Major's was of brick, with four rooms

            <p>The English building was begun in 1880 in the northwest segment of the Circle, with the Opera House
                    the first portion to be completed. William H. English contemplated a later extension of the
                    building, part of which might possibly serve as a public library.<hi rend="sup">99</hi> He went on a
                    tour of buildings in the East to decide on the style and arrangement, and at that time announced
                    that his son, William E. English, would manage the theater, with J. L. Saphere from the East as his
                    assistant. Construction of the theater was planned to begin in April,<hi rend="sup">100</hi> and the
                    building was expected to be ready for use by September 1.<hi rend="sup">101</hi> The elder English

                    and he decided to build up the entire front of that segment of the Circle, making it into an elegant
                    hotel, superior to anything then in <placeName>

            <p>Many difficulties arose in the course of construction, and W. H. English sometimes dealt with his
                    contractors in a high-handed manner to secure prompt action in completing the work. He insisted on
                    the newest and best available type of equipment in such matters as the hydraulic elevator. Later,
                    Manager William E. English reported with satisfaction that stars performing in the theater
                    pronounced it the best one in the West.<hi rend="sup">103</hi>

                    the Soldiers' Monument construction, and the excitement over the discovery of natural gas,
                    it seemed only good business to provide some unique form of entertainment for the crowds. Several
                    persons thought seriously of promoting a cyclorama, a circular building peculiarly adapted to an
                    exhibition that would at once be artistic, dramatic, historical, and highly exciting. Some thought
                    it might interfere with the business of the theaters, though no one was deeply concerned about that.
                    Remarkably lifelike battle scenes were depicted in such arenas in other cities, and were highly
                    successful. Accordingly, permission was secured and the building was erected on West Market Street.
                    It was constructed of brick, 400 feet in circumference, 50 feet high at the edge, and 100 feet high
                    at the center of the dome. At the grand opening in May, 1888, the "Battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName>" was shown to visitors for fifty and twenty-five cents admission. Natural
                    scenery, trees and shrubs, were placed in front of painted scenery, blending with it in a manner
                    which presented an illusion of distance, making the whole scene remarkably real. The details were
                    authentic, and J. F. Gookins, T. C. Steele, and Rev. N. A. Hyde were much impressed with it.<hi rend="sup">113</hi> Those who afterwards recalled visiting the Cyclorama regarded it as an
                    exciting experience, for it seemed that the actual event had been brought to a reality before their
                        eyes.<hi rend="sup">114</hi> The building was later razed to make way for the Terminal

            <p>In 1888-1889 the Propylaeum was built on North Street opposite the Blind Asylum. It was constructed
                    by architects Adolph Scherrer and W. Scott Moore, of Indiana limestone in the prevailing Romanesque
                    style. Its assembly hall seated 600 people, and other rooms were used as parlors, committee rooms,
                    offices, dining room, and kitchen. It continued to serve as a meeting place for clubs, as an art
                    gallery, banquet and lecture hall, as well as provide a place for dramatic entertainments, concerts,
                    and private social affairs, until 1924 when it was torn down to make way for the War Memorial.<hi rend="sup">116</hi>

            <p>The completion of the State House was probably the most notable architectural work of the decade. It
                    proceeded under the watchful eye of Adolf Scherrer, who had become supervising architect after Edwin
                    May's untimely death in February, 1880.<hi rend="sup">117</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vexatious lawsuits plagued the builders. Notwithstanding the care taken by the commissioners to
                    examine thoroughly every plan submitted to them, the disappointed architects instituted suits to
                    restrain progress of the work on the State House. Though they also enlisted some newspapers in their
                    cause, their efforts were in vain and work proceeded.<hi rend="sup">118</hi> The usual delays caused
                    by cold weather and occasional failure of machinery held up operations at intervals.<hi rend="sup">119</hi> After some five years of work there was discussion concerning the mistakes in judgment
                    of the original planners, and there seemed to be some possibility that the contractors might throw
                    up the job. It was recognized to be impossible to complete the work according to the original
                    estimate, due to the increased cost of labor.<hi rend="sup">120</hi> In 1883 the commissioners
                    decided to abandon the contract entirely and gave notice to the contractors. After considerable work
                    making new plans with new specifications by the supervising architect and his assistants, work was
                    resumed. This had, of course, involved a delay of several months and added expense for new plans,
                    thus postponing the date of completion of the building. Work had been suspended so long that it was
                    nearly the last of September when it was resumed, and cold weather arrived before much was
                    accomplished that season.<hi rend="sup">121</hi> Thereafter work proceeded without serious
                    interruption.</p>
            <p>In 1887 part of the building was occupied, enabling the legislature to convene there for the first
                        time.<hi rend="sup">122</hi> In 1888 the rest of the building was finished and occupied, and by

                    the prospect is that the cost will be $136,000 less than the appropriation! The

            <p>The entire work had taken more than ten years, from September, 1877, when instructions were issued to
                    architects, to October, 1888, when the final report was made. It housed the various state
                    departments, including the State Library; it was heated by steam, ventilated by four huge fans, and
                    was lighted by artificial gas, though it was also wired for electricity.<hi rend="sup">126</hi> The
                    architecture combined the best forms of Greek and Roman classic styles. On the first floor columns
                    were of Doric order, on the second, Ionic, and on the third, Corinthian, with marble corridors
                        throughout.<hi rend="sup">127</hi> The exterior lines show the influence of Romanesque style
                    which was currently considered beautiful and practical.</p>
            <p>The Inland City was in 1890 dominated by the new State House and the Soldiers' Monument
                    still under construction, and it might be expected that future artistic developments would be
                    strongly influenced thereby. Yet somewhat primitive characteristics continued in evidence; for
                    example, the lamplighter still made his rounds each night with his ladder, lighting the
                    old-fashioned oil lamps.<hi rend="sup">128</hi> Lawns were still enclosed by picket fences, but

                    </placeName> might have more fertile fields. In only a short time, however, he discovered that it

            <p>The distribution of southerners in counties north of the Wabash River is worth noting. Probably
                    because of its location and accessibility from the South, Wabash County had the largest number of

            <p>Two other counties, Miami and Cass, just west of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, while Cass fostered a generous sprinkling of natives from <placeName>

            <p>Strangely enough, LaPorte ranked fourth with 924, of which over 62 per cent were from <placeName>

                    </placeName>. It is likely that the National Road was used by a large number and then some trail
                    followed which intersected with the great highway. In Indiana the <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Allen County</region>
                    </placeName>. No doubt, <placeName>

                    the choice of those who made part of the trek by water. If the immigrant proceeded as far north as
                    the present site of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Toledo</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he may have continued his journey into Indiana on the Vistula Road. Moreover, if the
                    newcomer had a definite place of settlement in mind, such as <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> County which was traversed by the <placeName>

                    </placeName> into the Hoosier State were used. In the case of Fulton and Marshall counties, the <placeName>

            <p>Both Lake and Starke counties had fewer than a hundred from the South. Since Lake had a large New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> population, it is possible that it was not sought by southerners. The ague-infested
                    swamps in Starke County, no doubt, served to turn the eyes of the southern immigrant to other
                    regions.</p>

            <p>Because of inadequate records, the complete story of just when and in what numbers southerners began
                    to locate in northern Indiana may never be told. Since national and local conditions stimulated or
                    retarded emigration, it would be erroneous to conclude that many people emigrated when the business
                    cycle was at its lowest ebb. In a number of cases, it was necessary to save some money before the
                    journey to a new settlement could be undertaken. Moreover, the land sales may serve somewhat as a
                    measuring stick for emigration. In 1818 a high mark was recorded for the country as a whole, but by
                    1819 there was a noticeable reduction. Obviously, the panic of that year in its early stages must
                    have effected this decline. Emigration in the thirties increased and northern Indiana became more
                    popular. Likewise, by 1836 the land sales had reached a peak. The following year, however, another
                    panic made its inroads, and for the next five years a sharp decrease in land sales was noted.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> After the country had recuperated from this hardship, many again sought new
                    areas in the hope that such an event might be averted in the future.</p>

                    revealed that 86 per cent were above the age of twenty. The largest number, 9,279, were between
                    twenty and sixty years of age, in the most productive period of their lives.</p>
            <p>These energetic southerners engaged in numerous occupations, but the majority were farmers. Many took
                    an interest in civic affairs and a number were active in state government. From 1825 to 1850
                    thirty-two southerners were in the Indiana house of representatives and nine in the state senate. In

            <p>When the constitutional convention of 1850 met, seven southerners from northern Indiana held seats in

            <p>Southerners of northern Indiana were active in the political life of the state, represented numerous

                    spoken in turn for an entire month. ‘This practice,’ continues the supervisor,
                    ‘is based on the principle that nothing is learned outside of the element that is to be
                    conquered. We regard our pupils as so many swimmers who perceive with astonishment that they are

                    European and, to a certain extent, in American schools. The feature common to these recent methods
                    consists in using the medium of communication between teacher and pupil. The most flexible as well
                    as the most comprehensive of the methods in question is known as the ‘direct’
                    method. The teacher using this method endeavors to equip the pupil with a practical vocabulary, to
                    develop in him what the Germans call ‘Sprachgefühl,’ and to
                    introduce him, at as early a stage as possible, to the study of the life and literature of the
                    people whose language is taught. In the attainment of these ends, the most valuable traits of the

                    takes in the acquirement of language ('reform' method); the conversational
                    exercises ('natural' method) are arranged in series based on the association of
                    ideas ('psychological' method); grammar is taught inductively; and translation is

                    story was read wholly or in part in dialogue form, sometimes even dramatized by the pupils, who then
                    memorized and acted out the several parts. Beginning with the sixth grade, the written exercises

                    well-known fact, that one who begins a modern language in childhood will acquire a thorough
                    knowledge. In childhood the organs of speech are in a plastic condition. Good habits are easily
                    formed; bad habits are easily corrected. Because the mind acts more naively and the memory is more
                    tenacious, forms of expression are readily mastered as simple facts. Later, when the mind grows
                    stronger and more rigid, when the period of analyzing and reasoning begins, and speech habits in the
                    mother tongue have been fixed, it is difficult to acquire even a fairly good pronunciation, and
                    thinking in the foreign language becomes a difficult task. ‘With the dawn of puberty
                    certain linguistic possibilities are lost beyond the power of retrieval. This, I think, is the
                    consensus on the continent and most here realize that we begin too late.’ (G. Stanley

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> of America is the English language. The ‘Star Spangled Banner’
                    and ‘America’ are national songs and should be invested with the same high
                    quality of affection and respect that is paid to the flag. They should no more be used as mere
                    exercises for the instruction of children in foreign languages than the flag should be used for
                    commercial purposes. They should be invested with only the highest patriotic significance, and such
                    school children as do not know the English words of these songs should be required to learn them and
                    be taught their meaning. We decidedly oppose the teaching of American children to sing American
                    patriotic songs in a foreign language at any time, but for American children to be taught to sing
                    the ‘Star Spangled Banner,’ ‘America’ and other

                    grave. Section 6582a Burns Annotated Indiana Statutes 1914 (being section 1 of an Act in force April
                    5, 1909) provides that the State Board of Education require the singing of ‘The Star
                    Spangled Banner’ in its entirety in the schools of the state of Indiana upon all
                    patriotic occasions. It is unbelievable that the Legislature, when it enacted this law, intended
                    that our national songs should be sung by our children in a foreign language.</p>
            <p>"We do not, of course, know that this practice has been sanctioned by your Board. We request
                    that the Board make an immediate investigation of the facts and that if they are found to be as
                    stated in the first paragraph of this letter, then, on behalf of this organization, which consists
                    of about five hundred American citizens and tax payers of this City, we demand that the practice be

                    by pasting together the pages on which it was written. By way of contrast, on that same date the

                    membership came no longer existed. The board wrote a letter of thanks in reply, <list type="footnotes">

                    control and direction of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>

            <p>"Be it further resolved, that the Marion County Council request the said Board to

                    continue to be thoroughly loyal to the <placeName>

                    democracy, and it is mutually agreed that any act, utterance, or association with others on the part

                    </placeName>, shall be sufficient cause for the termination of this contract." Again the
                    board concurred.</p>
            <p>Eleven days later there was a protest from L'union Fraternelle Franchise against the
                    appointment of Peter Scherer as Supervisor of French, he being of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The president of the board assured the petitioners that their petition would receive
                    consideration. The following month a delegation composed of Carl Lieber, Clemens Vonnegut, and
                    George Mueller "appeared before the board, in behalf of Mr. Scherer, asking that he be
                    retained in the position in which he had been employed the preceding year." The board
                    solved its dilemma by means of the following resolution by Clarence E. Crippin:</p>

            <p>"Therefore, be it resolved, by the Board of School Commissioners that the position known as
                    ‘Director of Modern Languages,’ be, and the same hereby is, now abolished. Be
                    it further resolved that Mr. Peter Scherer be, and he hereby is, employed as ‘Supervisor

                    </placeName> during the semester ending on or about February 1, 1919."</p>
            <p>This resolution "was adopted by a full affirmative vote of all of the members of the board,
                    although Commissioner Tutewiler being absent, communicated her vote in favor of the resolution
                    through Commissioner Crippin." After the resolution was adopted, the following clause of
                    loyalty was inserted into the teacher contracts: The undersigned teacher further agrees that

                    </placeName> of America on the part of the teacher either in spoken or written word or act, shall be
                    ground for the teacher's discharge "for cause" within the meaning of that
                    term as used herein.</p>
            <p>Peter Scherer was placed in charge of <placeName>

            <p>A correspondent to the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> recently asked about the story
                    of a township in an Indiana county which early in 1861 declared that in the event the Union was
                    divided and the township was required to cast its lot with one or the other portion, it chose to be
                    attached to the Southern Confederacy. Accordingly, we are printing the account of the meeting that
                    drew up "The Famous Boggstown Resolutions," written by William R. Norris,
                    secretary of the Boggstown Convention, as it appears in Brant &amp; Fuller, <hi rend="i">History
                        of Shelby County, Indiana</hi> (<placeName>

                    account by William R. Norris.</p>
            <p>A search of some contemporary newspapers does not yield any corroboration of this event. The <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> would welcome further information about it.</p>
            <p>The following is Norris' account and the resolutions:</p>
            <p>"The meeting of the citizens of Sugar Creek Township, that assembled at the school-house in
                    Boggstown, on Saturday, the 16th day of February, 1861, was the most notable one that ever met in
                    the history of that township. It had been well advertised throughout the township by written notices
                    posted up in all public places the week before, and a general turnout of the citizens was secured.
                    The school-house was full and overflowing. The evening was mild, but cloudy and threatening,
                    somewhat in keeping with the disturbed condition of the country at that time. The meeting was
                    promptly organized at I o'clock P.M., by the selection of W. C. E. Wanee for president or
                    chairman, and Wm. R. Norris as secretary, both citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>
                    </placeName> now, but who were then residents of ‘Old Sugar Creek.’ At this
                    time Sugar Creek Township possessed more debating talent to the square inch, and a better knowledge
                    of parliamentary rules and usages, than any other township in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Debating had been assiduously cultivated at Boggstown as the central point of the
                    township for years and years, until everybody that would talk or wanted to talk, could talk. All the
                    questions of the day <pb n="382" id="VAA4025-050-4-066"/> current in debating societies had been
                    discussed time and again by the debating society that flourished at Boggstown permanently, and it
                    took in the entire township. The consequence was that the old farmers and their boys were all
                    debaters, and all took a pride in extemporaneous speaking. Hence a lively time was expected, as it
                    was anticipated that the last resolution would provoke bitter opposition from the Republicans
                    present, and there was a general turnout of them as well as the Democrats, who were in a large
                    majority in the township, being then about three to one.</p>
            <p>"On motion, W. C. E. Wanee, Dr. J. W. Smelser and Wm. R. Norris, were appointed a Committee
                    on Resolutions. The committee retired behind the school-house for consultation. Dr. Smelser drew
                    from his, coat pocket the Resolutions ‘cut and dried’ already written out,
                    they had been prepared by him and a cousin of his, Mr. Fullalove, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Ky., who had been visiting his, Dr. Smelser's, family for some two or three
                    weeks, and who was very desirous to have them adopted by the meeting, that he might take them back
                    home with him as the popular expression of the true sentiment of the people in a township like Sugar
                    Creek, situate in the heart of Central Indiana. The debate was opened by Dr. Smelser, who read the
                    resolutions and supported them in a speech of probably fifteen or twenty minutes. Smelser was a good
                    speaker, well informed and thoroughly posted on the political news of the day, and as he eloquently
                    urged the passage of the resolutions, especially the last one, the attention of the audience was
                    intense, you could have heard a pin drop, the silence was so complete; he was followed by Norris who
                    advocated the resolutions likewise and urged upon the meeting the propriety of adopting them entire
                    and especially the last one as the most important of all. Mr. Wanee, the chairman of the meeting
                    then rose, and drawing from his pocket a small book, said: ‘My friends, we are all met
                    here to-day for a common purpose, not as party men, but for the consideration of the great questions
                    that now disturb our common country and threaten this lovely land with all the horrors of civil war.
                    I will thereby read you, some extracts from this little book I hold in my hand, which is a laconic
                    work, on the horrors and terrors of war. I think the writer so much better expresses and describes
                    the horrors and evils than anything that I myself could offer, that I will read it to you, his essay
                    on war.’ <pb n="383" id="VAA4025-050-4-067"/> He then read from the book an exceedingly
                    well written description of the calamities caused by war. This occupied about ten minutes, as Mr.
                    Wanee read very slowly and impressively, he being an excellent reader. Three speeches had now been
                    made in behalf of the resolutions, and all of them by the Committee on Resolutions, and it begun to
                    look like there would be no opposition to the passage of the resolutions, but at this juncture Dr.
                    Wm. G. McFadden, a young physician and Republican, who then lived about two and a half miles north
                    of Boggstown, on the old McFadden homestead, the Doctor is now and has been a well known citizen of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>
                    </placeName> for many years, arose from his seat in the audience and requested the secretary to
                    re-read the resolutions and particularly the last one, as he thought that he had some objections to
                    the last one. The secretary complied, reading the resolutions deliberately and the last one very
                    slowly, word by word.</p>
            <p>"Dr. McFadden then proceeded to state his objections to the last resolution, saying, that he
                    thought it inexpedient in the present disturbed condition of political opinion, and in view of the
                    heated and exasperated feelings of the southern people, especially the slave holders, to pass such a
                    resolution, as it would in his judgment already add fuel to the flame so fiercely burning in all the
                    states south of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River. That would encourage them and make them believe that they had abundance of
                    sympathy and support right here in Indiana, and it might be the cause of precipitating a dissolution
                    of the Union, they expecting in that event that Indiana and other western states would go with them,
                    and form a new confederation that would embrace the Southern States, the Western States, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, and would leave the Yankee or New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> States out in the cold. That for his part he preferred keeping all the states together
                    and not permitting any division of the Union, and that, if necessary to keep them in, he should be
                    in favor of the government using coercion, much as he deprecated war, and civil war above all wars.
                    The young Doctor's speech made a profound impression, and was received with many marks of
                    approval by the Republicans present, whilst the Democrats looked somewhat uneasy for fear the
                    resolution would encounter decided opposition. At this point, Secretary Norris sprang to his feet
                    and commenced a rapid argument in favor of the resolution, enumerating the many geographical,
                    commercial and business <pb n="384" id="VAA4025-050-4-068"/> advantages that would enure to our
                    people by going with the South in case of a dissolution of the Union. He said amongst other things
                    that the whole <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> valley should go together, that God Almighty and nature designed them to be one and
                    indivisible, that as waters of our State flowed to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> to the Gulf—nature herself had pointed out our destiny—that as
                    for his part he was born with southern blood in his veins, that he could never go back on his native
                    State, old <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, that he had lived as they were all well aware, for more than two years quite recently,
                    in the Land of the Border Ruffians, Western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, right in the hot-bed of negro slavery, where they all owned slaves—that to
                    his certain knowledge western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> was a perfect nigger's paradise, that the slaves were well treated, many of
                    them better than they deserved. That from his knowledge of southern slave holders he would much
                    prefer going with them if they did secede and leave the Union, to allying himself to the
                    hypocritical, cunning, crafty, foxy, blue-bellied Yankees of the New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> States—and a great deal more was said by the secretary in the same vein.</p>
            <p>"Dr. Smelser followed with an earnest appeal in behalf of the South, stating that he had
                    been in slave states, that he knew the condition of the niggers in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> was much preferable to that of many poor white men in the North, and a thousand times
                    better than the condition of the overworked and underpaid operators in the factories of the Yankee
                    States. That he would prefer, infinitely prefer, a union with Southern slaveholders to a union with
                    the hypocritical Pharisees of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, the cold-blooded calculating Yankees, whose only God was money, who first stole the
                    niggers from Africa and sold them to the south, and who now wanted to free the niggers, so that they
                    could get them to come North and work for them, and wait on them for little or nothing, pay them off
                    in old clothes and cold victuals, whilst pretending to be their friends—they would rather
                    steal a nigger from a good comfortable home where he was well treated and taken care of, than to pay
                    some poor white man good living wages to do their drudgery. The Yankees were nearly all
                    Abolitionists, and he hoped that Caleb Cushing, Ben <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> and all such good Democrats, who were willing to stand by the south in protecting their
                    rights to their slave property would move out, and go to the south or west, where the people would
                    welcome <pb n="385" id="VAA4025-050-4-069"/> them with warm hearts and open hands. The Doctor said
                    much more in a similar strain, advocating the passage of the resolution with vehement eloquence. He
                    sat down and Dr. McFadden undertook to reply, by saying that he had no love for the Yankees nor the
                    Abolitionists, but he thought the resolution was premature and imprudent in view of the excited
                    condition of the public mind both north and south, that it might hasten a dissolution of the Union
                    much sooner than we anticipated, etc.</p>
            <p>"At this stage of the discussion, Homer Palmeter, an old man, and a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> Democrat, who read the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                        </placeName> Day Book</hi>, an ultra fire-eating, Democratic paper, morning, noon and night,
                    took the floor. He was an old man whose soul absorbing passion was politics, and who kept posted on
                    its every kaleidoscopic phase. He said amongst other things, ‘Mr. President, we hear much
                    said about coishun (coercion) in the papers, they're full of it, both Dimekratic and
                    Rippublican. I say Mr. President, let's bring it right home to ourselfs. How would you, Mr.
                    President, like to be coished (coerced, he meant). I know you wouldn't. We all know you
                    wouldn't. Now if it isn't right to coish (coerce) a man, it ain't right
                    to coish (coerce) a State. What's right between man and man is right between States and
                    States. "Do as you would be done by," is the golden rule of Holy Writ, laid down
                    by Christ himself, and don't undertake to coish (coerce) our Southern brithrin.’
                    He then launched into a philippic against the Abolitionists for agitating the slavery question and
                    disturbing the harmony of the people and the States.</p>
            <p>"Speeches were also made by many others, as the Secretary persisted in calling on every one
                    present for an expression of opinion. The two brothers, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and John McConnell, made temperate and logical speeches in favor of the resolutions.
                    Young Robert McConnell, eldest son of John McConnell, warmly endorsed the resolutions. Armstrong
                    Gibson advocated them in an impulsive manner. David Smith earnestly favored their adoption and
                    thought it was high time to cut loose from the meddlesome and accursed Abolitionists of the Yankee
                    States. He was followed by Adam Smith, his brother, who has distinguished himself of late years in
                    advocating the theory that the earth stands still and the ‘sun do move’ around
                    it, in numerous debates with some of the scientific men of the age. Uncle Adam said:
                    ‘Gentlemen, I have <pb n="386" id="VAA4025-050-4-070"/> been much interested in the
                    discussion of the resolutions, and I for one, am emphatically in favor of their adoption. If it
                    comes to a sepperation of the States I prefer to go with the Southern nigger drivers all the time to
                    agoin' with the Blue-Bellied Yanks. By Griddy them's my sentiments,
                    gentlemen.’</p>
            <p>"A number of other short speeches were made, by Chairman Wanee, Secretary Norris, Dr.
                    Smelser, Homer Palmerton and others. The large and influential relationship of the Johnstons and
                    Carsons, who comprised the bulk of the Republican voters of the township, were out in full force,
                    and they at first supported Dr. McFadden, the Union-at-all-hazards champion, in his determined
                    opposition; but they were gradually won over to the affirmative by the continued argument and
                    persuasion of the Democrats, until finally Dr. McFadden was left solitary and alone in his
                    opposition. As a last despairing effort, he said: Gentlemen, the people of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> are not all Abolitionists, and they are not as bad as has been represented. The Yankees
                    were good soldiers in the War of the Revolution, they helped us mightily to achieve our
                    independence. The Revolution, you remember, began at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Bunker Hill. I for one am not willing to give up "Yankee Doodle, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Bunker Hill." At this point the secretary, who was familiarly known as
                    Dick Norris, called upon his fast friend and bosom crony, Ben Farmbrough, the great trading man of
                    the township, for an expression of his sentiments. Ben, surnamed ‘Old Sly,’
                    slowly rose to his feet, and in his peculiarly quaint and comical tone, said: ‘Gentlemen,
                    you all know I'm not speech maker; but at sich a time as this I thinks it stands every man
                    in hand to impress his sentiments. I know the Southerners well; I hev traded in Old Kaintuck; I hev
                    bot stock thar, and I hev sold stock thar. Whatever a Kaintuckian tells you, you can depend on;
                    he's fair and squar; his word's as good as his bond. I speak what I know; I hav et
                    at thar tables, staid at their houses of nights, and had lots o’ deelins with
                    'em, and thars not a more cleverer or a more honorabler set of people on the face of the
                    urth than they ar. As for the blue-belli'd Yanks, I've hed deelins with them too;
                    an you've got to watch ‘em all the time, watch ‘em as well as pray,
                    for prayin wont do no good; they'll cheet you enny how if they git the least chance, an if
                    they don't they make a chance. I tel you the Devil will never git <pb n="387" id="VAA4025-050-4-071"/> his own until he gits the Yanks, and he'll be mighty loth to
                    claim 'em for he knows 'em too well; he knows they wouldn't be in hell
                    six months before they cheet him out of his kingdom and set up a government of their own. No,
                    he'll not take 'em in if he can help it, he'll just shut the door in
                    their faces and tel ‘em thro’ the keyhole that he don't want em, for
                    'em to go on still lower down, and set up a kingdom of their own, and cheet it out among
                    themselves. If we had the few good Dimekrats out o' New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, I would say, go to thunder, we don't want to be associated with you
                    dead-beets and everlastin cheets no longer. I fer one am fer the south. Them's my
                    sentiments.’</p>
            <p>"It is needless to remark that Ben's speech brought down the house, and that a
                    motion was thereupon made to vote for the resolutions. The chairman put the question, shall the
                    resolutions pass, it was answered from all parts of the room as well as out doors by a stentorian
                    yes. He then said, are there any opposed to the resolution. Dr. McFadden rose and said, I vote no
                    against the last resolution; he was feebly seconded by two others, whose names I have forgotten, and
                    one young man, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Andrews, refused to vote either way. The chairman declared the resolutions passed by a
                    large majority, nearly unanimous—he regretted that it wasn't entirely unanimous,
                    but the minority, no matter how small their numbers, were entitled to vote their sentiments.</p>
            <p>"The resolutions as passed by the meeting were taken to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Ky., the next Monday by Mr. Fullalove, Dr. Smelser's cousin, and by him

                    </placeName> papers, with a report of the meeting. The resolutions were published in the papers of
                    that city, with glowing comments by the editors, who represented that this was a true exponent of
                    the sentiments of the Western States, and that Sugar Creek Township had simply taken the initiative
                    in giving voice to their sentiments. That Sugar Creek Township was situated in Shelby County, the
                    home of the distinguished Democratic politician the Hon. Thomas A. Hendricks, and that no doubt
                    these resolutions were a true reflex of the sentiments prevailing not only in Indiana, but in all
                    the Western States. They were published all over the country from the Atlantic to the Pacific and
                    from the Lakes to the Gulf, and were circulated broadcast over the entire South. There is no doubt
                    that they proved an important factor in stimulating the spirit of secession and hastening the advent
                    of the inevitable conflict.’</p>

            <p>"There were no further attempts to hold Union meetings in Shelby County for some time, and
                    things drifted along in this manner until the firing on Fort Sumter brought about the crisis.
                    Nothing can well exceed the excitement occasioned by that first act of the rebellion. Public
                    meetings were held in most of the villages and hamlets throughout the North, at which speeches were
                    made and resolutions passed, denouncing the secession movement in unmeasured terms. The
                    President's call for 75,000 volunteers was responded to with alacrity. No portion of the
                    country was more prompt in stepping forward in defense of the Union than was Shelby

            <p>These concluding volumes of the Theodore Roosevelt letters cover Roosevelt's hunting trip to
                    Africa, his triumphant visits to the countries and royal courts of western Europe, his break with
                    Taft, his campaign for the Republican nomination in 1912 and his defeat, the organization of the
                    Progressive party, the election of 1912, his South American expedition in 1914, the liquidation of
                    the Progressive party, Roosevelt's opposition to American neutrality after 1914 and his
                    attempts to arouse the country to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> threat, his campaign for American military preparedness, his part in the presidential
                    campaign of 1916, his earnest endeavors to get into the war himself as an organizer of four
                    divisions and how he was rebuffed, his furious hatred of Wilson, his ideas of a proper peace
                    settlement after the war, his part in the congressional elections of 1918, and the increasing
                    convergence of all the anti-Wilson forces around the name and activities of Roosevelt—a
                    convergence which probably would have made him the victorious Republican nominee for President in
                    1920 had he lived and had his health permitted. These final volumes are edited with the wit and
                    insight which characterized the editing of the previous six volumes.</p>
            <p>Roosevelt was both an ambitious opportunist and a sincere believer in causes (what politician of the
                    first rank is not?), but in Roosevelt both the opportunism and the belief in causes are much more
                    pronounced than is usual. This is what makes him so paradoxical and so controversial a figure. The
                    revisionist view of Roosevelt, popular after his death and reflecting the inevitable reaction from
                    his personal popularity while he lived, had emphasized his opportunism. The current rehabilitation
                    of Roosevelt rightly emphasizes his strong and remarkably coherent and consistent philosophy.</p>
            <p>Roosevelt's campaign for the nomination against Taft, his organizing of the Progressive
                    party, his remaining in the race against Wilson, and his liquidating of the Progressive party can be
                    put down as evidence of Roosevelt's vaulting <pb n="390" id="VAA4025-050-4-074"/> ambition,
                    of his determination to "rule or ruin." But these letters and other evidence can
                    be used to make a convincing case for the other side. There can be no doubt that Roosevelt was a
                    sincere social-minded and national-minded democrat. He was sincerely shocked by Taft's
                    ineptitude and truckling to the conservatives in the Republican party. He honestly believed that he
                    represented the rank-and-file progressive views of the average American of around 1910 and 1912,
                    that the Republican party had a better chance of winning in 1912 and of advancing acceptable
                    progressive principles with him as the nominee than it had with Taft or LaFollette as the nominee.
                    Also, his contention that the Democratic party was the party of the "rural
                    toryism" of the South and the victim of its antiquated states-rights doctrines was no pose.
                    The split in the Republican party had already occurred before the nomination of the progressive
                    Wilson took place. Indeed, it is not improbable that Roosevelt's impending candidacy on the
                    Bull Moose ticket prodded the Democrats into rejecting the more conservative Champ Clark and
                    nominating Wilson. (In a sense, Roosevelt played in the rise of Wilson the role Douglas played in
                    the rise of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, although Roosevelt would be exasperated at this comparison, since he loathed Douglas,
                    came to loathe Wilson, and on almost every other page of his letters compares himself to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>.) After Wilson's nomination it would have been difficult for Roosevelt to
                    retire, even had he desired to do so, for he had made too many commitments to his associates and
                    followers; besides, he still earnestly believed that Wilson's program was too states-rights
                    oriented, that it lacked a Hamiltonian centralization which alone could make it effective. Moreover,
                    there was real wisdom in Roosevelt's scuttling of the Progressive party after 1914. He saw
                    earlier than the other Progressive leaders the impact of the World War on domestic politics, how the
                    war and postwar atmosphere would not be conducive to the growth of the Progressive party. He
                    discerned, too, what Beveridge and other Progressive leaders chose to ignore, that the Progressive
                    party, in spite of its remarkable showing in 1912, had not elected enough congressional, state, and
                    local officials, that it had not taken sufficient root in the precincts and localities to allow it
                    to become a major party.</p>
            <p>Theodore Roosevelt was one of the few Americans of his time who understood the international balance
                    of power. He <pb n="391" id="VAA4025-050-4-075"/> warned, particularly in his long and vivid letter
                    to George Otto Trevelyan describing his travels in Europe in 1910, that the new and astonishing
                    industrial efficiency of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName>, belatedly built on feudal class structures and combined with anachronistic
                    authoritarian traditions, might lead to wars of aggression for which Britain and America were
                    unprepared. His insights into <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>'s industrial and social structure anticipated by many years the brilliant
                    interpretations of Thorstein Veblen's <hi rend="i">Imperial <placeName>
                            <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                        </placeName>.</hi> Roosevelt believed that the world situation required and would continue to
                    require a close paralleling of British and American foreign policies, with universal military
                    service in both countries; and he even suggested, as early as 1914, that after the defeat of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> the Western powers might have to rebuild <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, with safeguards, to stand against Russia and the Slavs.</p>
            <p>However, along with this clear-headedness about the balance of power, Roosevelt was singularly blind
                    to some other aspects of international relations. He did not understand at all the anti-imperialist
                    revolutions, already taking place in his own day in <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName> and in Sun Yat-sen's <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName>. He did not understand the strength (and the underlying reasons for it) of the
                    collectivist movements in the Europe of his own day, and he did not at all understand or anticipate
                    the strength (and the underlying reasons for it) of the collectivist movements inside the
                    anti-imperialist revolutions of his day and a later day. Finally, Roosevelt was almost completely
                    unprepared for the growing tendency of all nations, both old and new, to cooperate, even federate,
                    in international organizations.</p>
            <p>There is no denying that Roosevelt, because of a mixture of personal ambition, hatred for Wilson, and
                    sincere belief in nationalism, encouraged some dangerous tendencies in American life. He led the
                    pack in the domestic anti-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> hysteria of 1914-1918. He was for loyalty oaths, the dismissing of teachers, the
                    banning of books. He would investigate historians like Robinson, Beard, and Shotwell; he would expel
                    LaFollette from the Senate; he would hang Viereck. After the October Revolution in Russia, he also
                    led the anti-Communist hysteria. He would send an American army to Russia to back the Cossacks and
                    the counter-revolution. His domestic enemies became Bolshevists, no better than Dantans,
                    Robespierres, <pb n="392" id="VAA4025-050-4-076"/> Marats, Lenins, Trotskys. He was not content
                    merely to cast out the I.W.W. or even Debs, Berger, and Hillquit as Communists. To this category,
                    from time to time, he consigned the Nonpartisan League, Hearst, LaFollette, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fremont</settlement>
                    </placeName> Older, Amos Pinchot, Rudolph Spreckels, Felix Frankfurter, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Baker, Woodrow Wilson. His hatred of Wilson knew no bounds. To Roosevelt, Wilson was
                    callous, perfidious, sinister; he was an empty rhetorician and a hypocrite; he was without
                    intellect, morals, or patriotism; he was a pacifist and even a traitor; he was by all odds- the
                    worst President in American history, much worse than James Buchanan. In numerous private letters to
                    British and French officials and leaders, Roosevelt, in the midst of the war, spewed out his savage
                    characterizations of the President. Often he would preface such letters with: "I hope the
                    censor won't see this." When Roosevelt's correspondents would suggest
                    that perhaps Wilson's timing of America's entry into the war was sound, that at
                    least he carried with him a fairly united nation, Roosevelt would reply that the nation was more
                    unified for war at the time of the sinking of the "Lusitania" than it was in 1917.
                    When Roosevelt's correspondents would hint at Wilson's brilliant use of the
                    pre-armistice negotiations with <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> to talk directly to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> people and undermine the Hohenzollern regime, Roosevelt would reply that Wilson was
                    merely attempting to doublecross the Allies, make a soft peace with <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, and win personal glory for himself. This "outrageous plan" of
                    Wilson, Roosevelt maintained, miscarried only because of the Republican congressional victory of
                    1918.</p>
            <p>By 1918 Roosevelt had become the symbol and the converging point of the anti-Wilson reaction. For
                    this role he was a "natural": his flaming hatred of Wilson, his shrill
                    anti-Bolshevism, his intense nationalism. It is safe to say that the "pro-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> isolationists" whom Roosevelt so severely castigated during the
                    war—the LaFollettes, the Hearsts, and the Vierecks—would have been
                    Roosevelt's allies by 1920, united by their common anti-Wilsonism and their nationalism.
                    Indeed, even during the war itself Roosevelt was flirting with some extreme opponents of the war,
                    among them Tom Watson of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> and Ernest Lundeen of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>. This was a foretaste of what would have come on a large scale had Roosevelt lived
                    until 1920. As early as 1918, Roosevelt was <pb n="393" id="VAA4025-050-4-077"/> preparing to wage
                    the campaign of 1920 on the issue of nationalism versus internationalism. In a letter to Beveridge,
                    Roosevelt gave assurances that anything he (Roosevelt) said which indicated sympathy for
                    internationalism was merely "a platonic expression" designed to mollify Taft and
                    other internationalists in the Republican party. And yielding to expediency on a measure which would
                    have been consistent with nationalism but not with isolationist nationalism, Roosevelt, usually so
                    clear-headed on the balance of power, indicated that he would oppose any American-British-French
                    alliance designed to protect <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> from renewed <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> aggression.</p>
            <p>Had Roosevelt lived on to 1920 and been elected President, it is possible that the conservative
                    reaction in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> would have been given a more articulate, decisive, and ideological orientation. On the
                    other hand, Roosevelt in power probably would have relaxed, become more objective. His bite was
                    never as formidable as his bark. There was something Gallic about Roosevelt. Like the politicians of
                    the Third French Republic, he liked to engage in polemics, personal controversies, fierce
                    journalistic onslaughts. In deeds French politicians are apt to be much more moderate than in words.
                    Roosevelt resembles Clemenceau; there was a strong similarity of outlook, manner, and methods.</p>
            <p>These letters testify that after 1910 Roosevelt was more frustrated than even the general public
                    supposed. They also testify to what the public did not suspect: that after 1910 Roosevelt was a
                    tired and in some ways a prematurely old man, that after 1914 he was a sick man.</p>
            <p>The eight volumes of letters reveal that Roosevelt was a man of considerable intellectual stature.
                    His first love was not biology but history, and while his earlier works, like the <hi rend="i">Thomas Hart <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Benton</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi>, were often superficial, had he gone into history writing as a profession, as
                    he once contemplated when he was Vice-President and saw little prospect of political advancement, he
                    might have developed into a historian in the grand manner. His description of the various stages of
                    historical development of the peoples along the Nile in his day and his account of the royal courts,
                    dynasties, aristocracies, and plain peoples of Western Europe in 1910 show much historical insight
                    and narrative power. Roosevelt the reader of literature and history was never as cock-sure as
                    Roosevelt the public man. (The years he occupied the Presidency, the <pb n="394" id="VAA4025-050-4-078"/> years in which he read less, were the years of his most irritating
                    intellectual cock-sureness.) Intellectually, Roosevelt showed considerable capacity for objectivity
                    and for changing his mind. In a letter to William E. Dodd, Roosevelt, always antagonistic to
                    Jefferson, reveals a genuine interest in Dodd's favorable interpretation of Jefferson; and
                    in Roosevelt's later life he largely rejected the racist theories of Lothrop Stoddard and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> Grant, theories with which in earlier life he had flirted.</p>
            <p>Students of Indiana history will be interested in the interchange of letters between Roosevelt and
                    famous Hoosiers like William D. Foulke, Lucius B. Swift, Charles W. Fairbanks, Will Hays, John W.
                    Foster, and Albert J. Beveridge. There is a series of curious and impudent letters between Foster
                    and Roosevelt. Roosevelt and Beveridge were never really close, not nearly so close as their
                    political collaboration would seem to justify, but in the final years both men were brought closer
                    together by their mutual distaste for Wilson, their hostility to internationalism, and
                    Roosevelt's genuine appreciation of Beveridge's first two volumes of <hi rend="i">The Life of John Marshall.</hi>

            <p>One finishes James D. Horan's long account of his search for new material with the feeling
                    that industry rewarded him. He had the use of the Baker-Turner Papers in the War Records Office of
                    the National Archives, which he says were still under lock and key when he first sought access to
                    them in 1951. While some documents dealing with the conspiracies in the North during the Civil War
                    were published in the <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi> of the war, the bulk of them were not.
                    Horan also used the papers of Thomas H. Hines, the hero of his book, that are in the Margaret I.
                    King Library of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, as well as some letters that passed between Hines and Nancy Sproule—whom
                    Hines married during the war—that are privately owned.</p>
            <p>Thus Horan had very important sources not used by Mayo Fesler for his basic study, "Secret
                    Political Societies <pb n="395" id="VAA4025-050-4-079"/> in the North during the Civil
                    War," that filled the September, 1918, number of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                        History.</hi> (That excellent article is cited in Horan's bibliography but with the
                    author's name incorrectly given as Fesley.) Nor were the two sources described open to
                    George Fort <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> when writing his very readable <hi rend="i">Abraham <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                        </placeName> and the Fifth Column</hi>, which appeared in 1942, nor to Professor Wood Gray,
                    whose well-documented <hi rend="i">The Hidden Civil War—The Story of the Copperheads</hi>
                    was published the same year.</p>
            <p>In view of what was previously known about the conspiracies, one reads with surprise the words,
                    "A Discovery in History," below the title of Horan's work. He certainly
                    did not discover Hines, for that plotter is a prominent character in both the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Gray books. Gray in fact states that Hines' "wartime exploits
                    would merit the pen of an E. Phillips Oppenheim"—as Horan himself notes.</p>
            <p>Horan is a newspaper man and novelist and he understands how to handle dramatic material and how to
                    write a lively story. Immediately, however, one is forced to feel that he lacks precise background
                    knowledge, wrote in haste, and did very inadequate checking.</p>
            <p>The book opens in the last of April, 1861, when the "Buckner Guides," captained by
                    Hines, rode south from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, on the Newtown pike. About noon the
                    little cavalcade turned into a side road, splashed across a creek, and rode up a little hill. The
                    wind apparently being in a friendly quarter, the riders were greeted with "the savory odor
                    of frying bacon and pork roasting over a spit." From the eminence, the camp of General
                    Albert <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Sidney</settlement>
                    </placeName> Johnston "spread before them." Pleasing details of the camp are
                    given; then one reads: "'Please tell General Johnston Buckner's Guides
                    are reporting for duty,’ Hines told the orderly who greeted them."</p>
            <p>That is pure fiction. In April, 1861, Albert <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Sidney</settlement>
                    </placeName> Johnston was in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. He reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> on September 14, and after spending some time at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, where
                    the Confederates erected a great work in the hopes of closing the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, he went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bowling Green</settlement>
                    </placeName>, arriving on October 28. He never had a camp near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. (The biography of Johnston by his son is a standard work.)</p>
            <p>In the section devoted to sources for the different chapters, Horan writes: "The description
                    of Buckner's Guides, <pb n="396" id="VAA4025-050-4-080"/> who joined General Albert <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Sidney</settlement>
                    </placeName> Johnston's command in April, 1861, is taken from the long, unpublished story
                    of Hines' life by Doctor James Blanton, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cumberland</settlement>
                    </placeName> County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, [written?] in 1864, hereafter known as the Blanton Mss. Much of the material was
                    contributed by Hines, General John Hunt Morgan and a Captain Cunningham. Blanton was probably trying
                    to sell the story to the <hi rend="i">Atlantic Monthly."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It looks as if the doctor compounded a strange concoction. And what about the trustworthiness of
                    Hines, if he contributed extensively to Blanton's piece? On the copy of the <hi rend="i">Atlantic Monthly</hi> article for July, 1865, entitled "The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Conspiracy," that is in the Hines Papers—one page of which Horan
                    reproduces—there are marginal notes by Hines. Apparently he made no repudiating comments
                    on the Blanton Manuscript. It may be noted that on page 78 Horan states that Dr. Blanton was a local
                    historian of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>; so one can stop blaming <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In treating Morgan's raid, Horan says, "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was Morgan's for the taking but for some reason he turned east from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>." A few sentences later he says, "With pursuit hot on their trail,
                    and no Copperhead underground army to aid them, the Confederate raiders were now averaging
                    twenty-one hours a day in the saddle." If Morgan was trying to get away, why speak as if
                    there were mystery in his eastward turn?</p>
            <p>Horan says, "Only eleven hundred raw recruits answered Governor Morton's call to
                    arms." That is not what Lew Wallace—summoned by Morton to take command of the
                    situation—whom Horan seems to use as a source, says in his <hi rend="i">Autobiography.</hi> The Hoosier general states that within twenty-four hours 65,000 men responded
                    to Morton's call "with arms," and cites the report of the Adjutant
                    General of Indiana. As to the 1100—that was the number of men that Wallace says he
                    entrained, with provisions, on the evening of July 10 [11?] at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Wallace also points out that Morgan did not even attack General John Love and his
                    State Legion at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He sent a surrender demand, but getting a sharp refusal, Morgan decided he had
                    business in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Why must we eternally have the picture of the Indiana capital saved by a quirk of the invader? Why
                    could not Horan have elaborated on the truth, which he seems to have <pb n="397" id="VAA4025-050-4-081"/> seen? Of course it makes one quiver to think of the helpless Hoosier
                    city just waiting to be plucked—almost asking for it. But there is plenty of high drama
                    in General Hobson's splendid pursuit of Morgan with 2500 well seasoned, well armed, cavalry
                    in blue, as well as in Love and his Legion, and in the brand new 102nd, 103rd, and 104th Infantry
                    regiments, that did not stay to defend <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but went to meet Morgan, and finding him gone, joined in the pursuit.</p>
            <p>Horan gives a "Timetable" in the front of his book, as a device to help the reader.
                    But he failed to consult a timetable himself, and he is badly confused when on page 41 he links
                    Morgan's raid into Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> with his absence from the battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Murfreesboro</settlement>
                    </placeName>. That battle occurred six months before the raid across the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and while Morgan was on a short raid into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. It was pursuant to General Bragg's orders, not contrary to them, that Morgan
                    was away "when Rosecrans rolled out" (of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>), as Horan picturesquely puts it.</p>
            <p>On page 79 Horan has Hines arrive in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Toronto</settlement>
                    </placeName> on April 20, 1864, with orders from the Confederate Secretary of War to work with the
                    Mission to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. He had gone by land, and on May 29 he met Commissioners <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> (Clement C.) and Thompson (Jacob) in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Montreal</settlement>
                    </placeName> (page 84). The commissioners had left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> on May 3 and had run the blockade to Bermuda, where they took ship for <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. Thompson went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Toronto</settlement>
                    </placeName> with Hines and the latter spent considerable time rounding up escaped Confederate
                    prisoners. Forgetting when the conspirators reached <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, Horan says (page 88), "In the <hi rend="i">winter</hi> [italics mine] of
                    1864, when he returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Toronto</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Hines was horrified to learn how easy it was to get gold out of Thompson."</p>
            <p>On page 83 we read: "On May 9, Morgan and his troopers had defeated the Union columns
                    marching on Saltville, in Western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>…. That night in the bar at the Queen's in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Toronto</settlement>
                    </placeName> men in ragged gray lifted their glasses to toast the gallant Morgan and roar out the
                    words of ‘The Raiders Ride Tonight’"</p>
            <p>The Confederates did use some submarines. But it is not in the record that they had radios, and it is
                    absurd to assume that there was a telegraphic report in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Toronto</settlement>
                    </placeName> of a minor action near Wytheville, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, on the very day it took place.</p>
            <pb n="398" id="VAA4025-050-4-082"/>
            <p>The Federals also did some rapid communicating. According to Horan, Colonel Jeffrey Sweet, commanding
                    the Confederate prisoner of war camp in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, learned the final details about the planned liberation of prisoners about midnight of
                    November 7-8, 1864 (page 190). The coup was to take place the next day, November 8, Hines being the
                    mastermind in the plans. Sweet wrote a dispatch to Brigadier General John Cook in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>, outlining the plot and asking for re-enforcement, since he had only 800 troops to
                    guard 8000 to 9000 prisoners. He was afraid, however, to use the telegraph, and Horan says (page
                    191), "Sweet sent the message to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> by a special courier on horseback." The courier must have made it, for we read
                    on page 199 (the time now being the 8th), "Additional troops arrived during the morning to
                    augment Colonel Sweet's men."</p>
            <p>Horan not only gives the wrong volume, but the wrong series of the <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi>
                    for Sweet's dispatch. It was not written near midnight on November 7, but at 8:30 P.M. on
                    November 6. Sweet explained that he was using a messenger, partly because he was afraid of the
                    telegraph, and partly because he could write more at length. Presumably the courier rode comfortably
                    behind an iron horse on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and A#2 R.R. General Joseph Hooker, in Sandusky at the time, had to make the final
                    decision, and on November 7 he telegraphed Sweet, "I have directed General Cook to
                    re-enforce you with two companies from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to join you as early as sundown tomorrow." Cook, on his part, telegraphed
                    that the governor had directed that the militia of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> should be held subject to Sweet's orders, and he told Sweet to command them at
                    once. So everything had been well provided for before Horan's messenger started his
                    180-mile gallop.</p>
            <p>Horan's book will probably have more readers than those by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Gray, because he has made the story vivid. He states that in the writing, it was
                    "the novelist versus the historian," and that though he felt the
                    "creative urge" he restrained himself; "at every step the historian would
                    silently point to the facts." Such a statement should have obligated the author to more
                    than ordinary care. In view of errors such as have been pointed out—and more that were
                    passed over—the assurance that even the conversations with which the book abounds-are not
                    "Actionized," but are based on documents of some kind, is not impressive.</p>
            <pb n="399" id="VAA4025-050-4-083"/>
            <p>Undoubtedly Horan was in possession of fresh material, and his book is made more interesting by
                    reproductions of some of it. It is a pity that the manuscript was not carefully edited and checked,
                    for Horan might have made a really valuable contribution. Inasmuch as the book was not adequately

            <p>Throughout the Civil War the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government wrestled with the problem of setting up tests which would prove the loyalty
                    of its citizens, and when the war was over and the Reconstruction period set in, the problem
                    remained as vital as ever. In the one period, loyalty and the knowledge of who was loyal were
                    necessary to win the war; in the other, they were equally necessary to win the peace.</p>
            <p>The authorities never got beyond the oath of allegiance in their quest for a test, but for
                    twenty-three years, from 1861 to 1884, which might be called the "Era of the Oath"
                    in American history, they devised one oath after another and fought over methods of applying it. By
                    the first few months of the war, the old oath of allegiance had come to be considered insufficient,
                    and although the executive departments had devised new oaths or had reapplied the old oaths,
                    Congress in August, 1861, passed a law setting up a uniform new oath. The next year Congress devised
                    an oath for jurors, but by far the most important of the oaths Congress adopted was the famous
                    "Ironclad Test Oath," passed on July 2, 1862. This was the oath which became so
                    important in Reconstruction times, for it not only related to present and future loyalty, but also
                    included past loyalty.</p>
            <p>It was this oath which became the most potent weapon in the hands of the Radicals in establishing
                    their control over the South. It was a great political weapon in the fight between the Radicals and
                    President Johnson. The President attempted <pb n="400" id="VAA4025-050-4-084"/> to build his
                    reconstruction program on present and future loyalty, but if this oath were applied, the base of his
                    government crumbled; for nearly all southerners had given aid and comfort to the Confederacy. The
                    Radicals by administering this oath sifted out of the South for the foundation of their governments
                    the unterrified southerners who had never bowed the knee to Davis.</p>
            <p>Practically everybody in the North and in the South at one time or another was required to take an
                    oath. If he were a federal official, a soldier or sailor, a member of Congress, a state official, a
                    postmaster, a steamboat captain, a country merchant, or whoever he might be, sooner or later he was
                    confronted with an oath to take.</p>
            <p>What was the purpose of all this oath-taking? Apart from the politics which was mixed up with it
                    during the Reconstruction, it was an attempt to establish a person's loyalty. Was the oath
                    a success in establishing loyalty? The author concluded that it was not. An investigation of the
                    facts of a person's life would have been a much more potent method, for many people were
                    willing to take an oath lightly with many mental reservations. Yet that person was accepted, whereas
                    the conscientious person who put the sanctity of an oath above all else, and refused to take it, was
                    rejected. It is an interesting fact that John F. Potter, a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> Congressman, headed a committee to ferret out the disloyal, but its methods gained for
                    the committee a reputation reminiscent of a present-day committee headed by another <placeName>

                    </placeName> member of Congress.</p>
            <p>Harold M. Hyman, the author of this book, has made a remarkably complete and scholarly study of the
                    oath. He has presented his vast body of factual material in a logical and readable arrangement and
                    has throughout shown a mastery of his subject.</p>

            <p>The role of British politics in the imperial convulsion of 1763-1783 has been described by many
                    historians, but by <pb n="401" id="VAA4025-050-4-085"/> none as succinctly and accurately as by
                    Charles R. Ritcheson. Twenty-five years ago Sir Lewis Namier published his classic description of a
                    fractured political system, and if Ritcheson has not improved on that picture, he has, unlike
                    virtually all of his predecessors, utilized it in his narrative. As an analysis of the American
                    problem in British politics this modest volume is incomparably better than anything in print. It
                    incorporates the latest available research and makes use of manuscript sources not hitherto open to
                    workers in the Revolutionary vineyard.</p>
            <p>The broad outlines of the story are well known. George Grenville stirred the sleeping dragon of
                    discontent, and Rockingham won but a Pyrrhic victory in 1766. Chatham's ministry was
                    disastrous and North hardly the man to teach George III the beauties of a "federal
                    empire." Neither America nor the Opposition could unseat North's majorities,
                    however, and too late he extended the hand of conciliation. Within this framework Ritcheson
                    carefully elucidates the development of American policy by the shifting ministries of 1763-1778, and
                    describes the manner in which factional antagonisms weakened and ultimately defeated each succeeding
                    effort. For perhaps the first time in one volume Grenville, Pitt and Shelburne, Rockingham and
                    Burke, all receive equally fair treatment. Ritcheson demonstrates clearly that British statesmen
                    were very much aware of the problems of empire and that the best made every effort, according to
                    their views, to implement one solution or another. Their programs, which are the author's
                    chief concern, are judiciously described and North's conciliatory proposals carefully
                    evaluated. The terminal point of 1778 is selected on the ground that the dispatch of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Carlisle</settlement>
                    </placeName> Commission "represented the end of an historical process, which had begun with
                    the first impact of the American problem on British politics" in 1763. Ritcheson credits
                    the destruction of the old Empire to "the splintered condition of the Whig Party"
                    and the rise of "a new conservatism" that could not comprehend "the only
                    permanent solution of the tangled problem… the federal principle."</p>
            <p>As far as "American" politics (i.e. policy) was a predominating element in
                    factional intrigue (and to the extent that British imperial policy contributed to the emergence of
                    the American nation) Ritcheson's work may stand unchallenged. <pb n="402" id="VAA4025-050-4-086"/> The boundaries, unfortunately, are far from clear, and the complexities
                    of personal politics cannot be illuminated by a few swift strokes. Ritcheson's characters
                    move across the scene with great precision but without that clash of personality with which the
                    period was replete. Brevity in historical writing is often a blessing, but had the author availed
                    himself of greater pen-room he would have secured a better perspective. It is not sufficient to
                    point out that factions differed on American issues; there were factions long before 1763, and they
                    remained at odds long after 1778 for good English reasons. Ritcheson but mentions in passing those
                    matters which often threatened to obscure the American problem altogether. Still less does he
                    delineate the "new conservatism" which provided North with majorities after 1770.
                    This new conservatism ofttimes appears old King writ large. It was the King, not Lord North, who
                    rose above Saratoga's stricken field, and it was the reaction of 1780, not 1770, that
                    enabled George to weather Yorktown. As neither British imperial politics nor the American Revolution
                    ended in 1778, the subject may be considered open for further discussion.</p>
            <p>In brief, though "The American Problem in British Politics" might have been a more
                    accurate title, this book will stand forth with pride of place between Alvord's and
                    Harlow's massive volumes as a work of sound scholarship and lasting merit.</p>

                    </placeName>: Vantage Press, 1954, pp. xi, 160. Illustrations and index. $3.00.)</head>
            <p>Christiana Knoedler, in this little book, has recreated the life of one of the most interesting of
                    the many socio-religious communities that were established on the frontier early in the nineteenth
                    century. The book is scarcely a history of the Rappites or a reminiscence of the way of life of the
                    Harmony Society in its declining years. It is rather a combination of brief historical or background
                    chapters and sketches of biographical or descriptive nature. The author, after all, is describing
                    her own beloved home and the experiences, in part, of her own family and its associates. When she
                    writes: <pb n="403" id="VAA4025-050-4-087"/> "Often as I sit at the organ, softly playing
                    the prelude for the service in fancy I see the meetings of years gone by," she indicates
                    the method by which the book was written. As some episode, individual, or landmark occurs to her, it
                    is lovingly described, given a chapter title, and fitted into her book.</p>
            <p>The Harmony Society, fortunately, has had rather more written about it than have many of the
                    communitarian settlements. Its longevity and economic success, its connection with Robert Owen, its
                    colorful leader, all combined to make it interesting, and the contemporary material for many
                    episodes in its history is ample. The Society has been fortunate, too, in having two fairly detailed
                    histories written nearly eighty years apart by men long intimately connected with the settlement:
                    Dr. Aaron Williams, whose book, <hi rend="i">The Harmony Society</hi>, was published in 1866, and
                    Dr. John Duss, one of the Society's last trustees whose account (published in 1943) covered
                    its whole span from its <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> origin to its dissolution in 1905.</p>
            <p>This new book adds nothing to the evidence already available for the history of the Rappites. Its
                    value lies in its intimacy and in its detail. Other books on American communities have given this
                    society its place among the nineteenth century experiments or "Utopias." All that
                    can be discovered, probably, about George Rapp and the society he founded has been published. Their
                    place in the group of communities with religious or social objectives—or
                    both—is secure. In the period when the Harmony Society flourished, Utopianism and
                    perfectionism were marked phenomena of American life. This account adds a little more detail for the
                    social historian and furnishes, with its profuse illustrations, one more reminder of a past when
                    America was willing to permit a wide variety of social experimentation.</p>

            <p>The thirty-five chapters deal with legal, economic, social, and political conditions aiding and
                    hindering the establishment and development of a public high school, and with specific discussion of
                    buildings, locations, faculty, students, boards of education, curriculum, five wars, athletics,
                    music, drama, parent-teacher relations, and alumni. An appendix of six sections gives lists of
                    principals, oldest living alumni, distinguished alumni, officers of PTA and Student Government,
                    current faculty, the Centennial Class of 1954, national affiliations, publications, benevolences,
                    honors and awards, and a chronological table of important events of the first hundred years.</p>
            <p>The research done for the book withdraws a previous belief that Central is the oldest high school in
                    Indiana, but substantiates its claim to two important firsts: (1) "Central of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> is the first free public high school in Indiana to remain in continuous existence,
                    never having closed during its <pb n="405" id="VAA4025-050-4-089"/> hundred years of
                    existence." (Preface); (2) "The first known junior high school now an accepted
                    part of secondary education, was established in Central in 1912." (p. 51)</p>
            <p>Credit for (1) is given "to the courageous first Board of School Trustees" for
                    "the momentous decision" in 1854 to establish a high school, and especially to H.
                    Q. Wheeler, head of the board. "There is no doubt that it was the sincerity and zeal of H.
                    Q. Wheeler which swayed his colleagues to… the idea." (p. 25) It was Wheeler who
                    the previous year "was actually the father of the plan for free education for all"
                    when the first free public grade schools were opened in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>

            <p>Credit for (2), the junior high school, goes to Ernest P. Wiles, principal of Central from 1910 to
                    1916. Wiles became interested in the junior high school theory while doing graduate work at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> University before coming to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Meyer says: "Attendance beyond the eighth grade was optional with the
                    students in those days, and each year hundreds of them rejected the chance to enter high school.
                    Principal Wiles knew that those boys and girls needed the high school. The problem was to get them
                    into the school before the ninth grade, thus interesting them in the activities of the high school
                    so that they would be eager to stay through the next four years. He succeeded in convincing the
                    Board of the merits of his plan and got them to agree to make the radical move. <hi rend="i">Thus
                        was born the junior high school movement, not only for <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                        </placeName> but for the entire <placeName>

                        </placeName>."</hi> (p. 51)</p>
            <p>Letters from Wiles, who is now past eighty years old, received by Meyer during 1953, say: "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> can well boast… the first junior high school in
                    Indiana—America—and the world…. Of course it was only the
                    beginning, and since then the movement has spread over the land and has taken on maturity of form as
                    it should." (p. 53)</p>
            <p>Central has had and still has many great teachers, whose names and work Meyer records, too many to
                    list here. Myself a member of the Class of 1901, I recall after more than half a century mathematics
                    learned from Miss Sarah Vickery (Miss Sadie to us) and Mrs. Adelia Hornbrook; Latin from Mrs.
                    Augusta B. Corsett; English literature from Miss Daisy Flower (Mrs. Henry B. Veatch, Sr.) and Miss
                    Edith Reilly, who lent us classics to read during summer vacations; and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> literature from Karl Knortz, though it was not until <pb n="406" id="VAA4025-050-4-090"/> many years later in my own Indiana University teaching days that I knew Herr Knortz, as we always
                    called him, was then a recognized authority in both America and <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> for his translating and editing of the works of Walt Whitman, which introduced the
                    great poet to European readers.</p>
            <p>Henry A. Meyer is particularly qualified to serve as the author of the history of Central High
                    School. He is a lifelong resident of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, having received his grade and high school training there, as did his mother and father
                    before him. He graduated from Central in 1912, and has taught in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> from 1913, since 1926 at Central, where he now teaches mathematics and <placeName>

                    </placeName> and southwestern Indiana. He is an expert in pictorial and technical photography, and
                    an authority on philately. He has done much research on the postal history of southwestern Indiana,
                    especially on mail carried by <placeName>

                    old-time river steamboats.</p>
            <p>Meyer gives generous credit in his book to many persons and organizations assisting him in research
                    and in supplying material, but he is the one who organized and directed all the research and did all
                    the writing, except for three chapters on vocal and instrumental music and drama, which were written
                    under his direction by three Central students of the Class of 1955. Much of his material was used
                    when <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> celebrated in 1947 its centennial as a chartered city. During the next half dozen years
                    he concentrated on collecting material on Central High School. The volume here reviewed is evidence
                    of his effective work.</p>

            <p>In publishing this reprint of Indiana's first gazetteer, one of the earliest books produced
                    in the state, the Indiana Historical Society has made a significant contribution to the observance
                    of the 150th anniversary of the free press in the Hoosier state. It was in 1804 that Elihu Stout
                    brought the first printing press into Indiana Territory.</p>
            <p>The reprint contains an excellent introduction of twenty-three pages by Gayle Thornbrough, editor of
                    Indiana Historical Society publications. Not only does Miss Thornbrough give a detailed description
                    of the work of John Scott from the time he emigrated to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1816 to his death at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1838, but she also includes a critical analysis of the <hi rend="i">Gazetteer</hi>
                    itself. A reviewer could hardly improve on the evaluations given in this introduction.</p>
            <p>John Scott was one of Indiana's foremost printers, at least in the pioneer period. He grew
                    with the state which entered the Union in the same year that he arrived within its borders. He and
                    other early printers were largely responsible for raising the cultural level in the raw West,
                    although it is not known how many copies of the <hi rend="i">Gazetteer</hi> were sold for
                    twenty-five cents each or two dollars for a dozen.</p>
            <p>The original work has been reproduced as nearly as possible. Apparently the volume which was used in
                    this project is in good condition. Only in one or two instances did the editor encounter any
                    difficulty due to illegible print or worn paper where the type was lost or obscured. The reviewer
                    feels, however, that the original pagination should have been followed in the reprint. It would have
                    made easier reading, and the general appearance of the pages would have been improved. However, the
                    editor may have had some practical reason for this decision. Three photostats from the original
                    indicate the type and page form.</p>
            <p>The original <hi rend="i">Gazetteer</hi> contains a title page, a copyright page, and three pages of
                    preface by Scott. A general description of the geological, political, religious, cultural and
                    economic conditions of the state is given in the next twenty-one pages. The following 107 pages
                    contain descriptions of all the <pb n="408" id="VAA4025-050-4-092"/> towns, counties, lakes, rivers,
                    streams, etc., listed alphabetically from Abington to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Winchester</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Two pages of <hi rend="i">Appendix</hi> give a list of several of the principal roads
                    and distances in Indiana. There are four pages of <hi rend="i">Addenda</hi>, "consisting of
                    several items of information received too late for a place under their proper heads." The
                    book concludes with nearly two pages of "Recommendations" from Governor James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> Ray and other state political leaders.</p>
            <p>As a companion piece the Indiana Historical Society has published a reprint of Scott's 1826
                    map of Indiana. This is a fascinating map, partly because of its inaccuracies, but it also has value
                    in showing the political subdivisions as they existed at the end of Indiana's first decade
                    of statehood. The Indiana Historical Society has rendered a real public service in publishing the
                    reprint and the accompanying map.</p>

                    presented have not been known, and some of the ideas and theories already in common currency will
                    now have to be changed.</p>
            <p>In the proceedings of the <placeName>

                    concerning "a [projected] Town to be called Saltsburg" (pp. 147-148). It was to be

                    notice that Croghan chronology will now have to be revised (note 78, pp. 478-479). These are
                    illustrative <pb n="409" id="VAA4025-050-4-093"/> samples of the sort of information to be found in

            <p>George Mercer and his father, John, were intimately connected with the <placeName>

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> to get clear titles for the lands the company was originally granted in 1749. Original
                    documents, official copies of others, official correspondence to Mercer, and the records of his
                    dealings with the Walpole Company make up the corpus of the manuscripts printed in this volume.
                    There is also a facsimile reproduction of a unique George Mercer pamphlet concerning the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Company.</p>
            <p>The nature of the documents printed in the volume is such that they contain considerable information
                    on the economic and social history of the eighteenth century especially in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. This material, although of considerable value, has not been subjected to editorial
                    scrutiny in the notes because, Lois Mulkearn explains, it is not relevant to the story of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Company.</p>
            <p>Despite the significance of this volume and the reception which its contents warrant, there are
                    certain characteristics of its editing and general make-up which are both awkward and confusing. The
                    order in which the contents of the volume are presented, for example, is rather unfortunate. Of its
                    four parts, the first and second are the documents and the third and fourth are notes and comments;
                    but part three is related to the second and part four to the first.</p>
            <p>Within the first section itself, the documents are not printed in the usual chronological order. This
                    situation occurs because a number of documents, in turn not in chronological order, are printed as
                    enclosures of letters. The section is prefaced by a "Chronology of
                    Communications," in reality an analytical chronology of the documents themselves. The
                    arrangement of the documents lessens the value of the analytical preface, whose value in turn is
                    lessened by errors it contains.</p>
            <p>The location of the notes apart from the points in the documents which they concern lends to further
                    confusion. This is too bad because they are meaty and obviously the work <pb n="410" id="VAA4025-050-4-094"/> of painstaking and prodigious scholarship. The notes are numbered but
                    the page to which each refers is not indicated. Further, one note often refers to more than one
                    place in the documents. This leads to a curious situation. For example, one is confused to find on
                    page 234 in the documents superior figures for notes 687, 7, 688, 9, and 11, in that order. Further
                    confusion is afforded in the index where it is usually necessary to give dual page references, one
                    to the document section and the other to the note section.</p>
            <p>Another aspect makes for awkwardness. The second part of the book is a facsimile reproduction. The
                    pages of the facsimile, of course, carry the numbers of the original document. Then there is a
                    multi-page appendix to the facsimile whose pagination is yet a separate one. The absence of
                    additional continuing pagination of the text, which is only assumed in this case, is resumed (with
                    an error) after the facsimile insertion. In the index then, for example, there are many entries of
                    this nature: "Potomac River (Va.): 69, 241, 249, <hi rend="i">fac. 2, 8, fac. app.
                        25." "Fac"</hi> and <hi rend="i">"fac. app."</hi>
                    mean "facsimile" and "facsimile appendix" respectively. If the
                    pagination of the volume were carried through the facsimile the index entry cited above would take a
                    much simpler form: "Potomac River (Va.): 69, 241, 249, 332, 338, 391."</p>
            <p>In the bibliography, there is a section called "Calendar of Communications." This
                    seventeen page calendar lists almost four hundred documents covering the period from 1682 to 1905.
                    Only about one-third of these, however, are labeled as "manuscript material
                    consulted." The remainder are supposedly of some pertinence. Relevance may be stretched to
                    mean "universal" but it is not always relevant to do so.</p>
            <p>From an editorial standpoint a number of ambiguities and practices detract from the utility of the
                    volume. It will suffice to mention some by way of illustration. There is no distinction made between
                    italicized statements which are editorial and those which are not. Also, without explanation, while
                    some passages are italicized others are underlined. Further confusion is produced from the frequent
                    use of brackets, parentheses, and "&lt; &gt;" marks. Again, some seem to
                    be editorial and others do not. Lined out portions from the original documents are reproduced, and
                    some of these contain brackets which are also lined out. Are they, in the ordinary usage of
                    brackets, editorial, or not?</p>
            <pb n="411" id="VAA4025-050-4-095"/>
            <p>An index entry "Bloody Run (Pa.): junction of Indian paths, 474; <hi rend="i">see also</hi>
                    Everett." leads one to the unrewarding entry "Everett (Pa.). <hi rend="i">See</hi>
                    Bloody Run." Further comments might be made about bibliographical notes, consistency of
                    citations, and other of the mechanical aspects of the volume, but these will suffice to illustrate
                    the unfortunate things which will hinder rather than expedite use of this valuable collection of
                    documents.</p>

            <p>Phelps Dodge &amp; Co. has meant to the American public a vast western mining empire, but this
                    development did not take place until after the death of William E. Dodge. While he was a partner,
                    the main business of the company was the importation of tin plate, and the allied activities made
                    the organization sound like a country store, with dealings which ranged from other metals to tea and
                    rugs, and from cloth to beeswax. Particularly important was the export of cotton from the South, for
                    cotton provided return cargo for ships which had brought metal from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. The operations ranged as far afield as <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName> and the East Indies, while in America selling agents covered the entire nation, and

            <p>The interests of Dodge and of the company moved rapidly into various more or less related fields,
                    with investments in iron and copper mines; in brass, copper, iron, and glass manufacturing; in
                    timber land and other real estate; in railroads, insurance, telegraph, and cable enterprises. Dodge
                    himself seldom did any direct management, but now and then he intervened to be sure that the
                    directors followed his general ideas. Most of Dodge's investments turned out well, but
                    there were the inevitable failures, particularly with the various fluctuations of general
                    prosperity. Dodge's success can be credited mainly to his own efforts, even though he by no
                    means started as a penniless immigrant, and even though he followed an old recipe for success by
                    marrying the boss's <pb n="412" id="VAA4025-050-4-096"/> daughter. His estate at the time
                    of his death was estimated at between five and ten million dollars.</p>
            <p>Dodge was an able businessman, direct, orderly, and clear thinking. Apparently he had high integrity,
                    for while he was several times accused of bad practices, there apparently was little justification
                    for the charges. In fact his moral principles sometimes hurt his profits, as when he sold railroad
                    stock because he did not approve of trains running on Sunday; in one such case, however, the moral
                    principles were financially profitable when he sold such stock between $110 and
                    $120, with shortly thereafter the railroad going bankrupt and stock falling to ten cents
                    a share. Basically, he was convinced that there were "other and more important
                    things" (p. 189) in life than the making of money. A profoundly religious man, he not only
                    joined and contributed to various religious and philanthropic enterprises, but also devoted great
                    personal efforts to their promotion. Among his interests were the Sunday School Union, the American
                    Bible Society, the American Tract Society, and the YMCA. For over twenty years he was vice-president
                    of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. He helped several theological
                    seminaries, participating in the founding of Union Theological Seminary, and then sitting on its
                    board of directors. Temperance enlisted his greatest reforming zeal, and temperance was transformed
                    into prohibition by the end of the Civil War. He opposed slavery, but his position was moderate,
                    with at times exasperation for what he felt to be the extremist positions of many abolitionists; for
                    twenty years he was vice-president of the American Colonization Society. Other benefactions covered
                    a wide range, including such varied projects as the American Geographical Society, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society, the Metropolitan Museum, the Museum of Natural History, and the
                    Mercantile Library. He was always greatly interested in education, and in his many benevolences gave
                    particular attention to Negro education.</p>
            <p>Politically, Dodge remained an inactive Whig until long after that party was practically moribund.
                    His political interests were greatly roused by the difficulties of 1860, and while at first he
                    favored the Union Party as representing a calm middle position, he soon swung to the Republicans,
                    with the presumption that they had promised not to interfere with slavery in the states. When war
                    loomed menacingly, he did <pb n="413" id="VAA4025-050-4-097"/> everything possible to encourage a
                    compromise of sectional differences—and certainly he was not uninfluenced by his business
                    interests, of which many were in the South. When war came he supported the Northern point of view,
                    and was particularly active in the Christian Commission, which was a rival of the Sanitary
                    Commission. His support of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1864 was lukewarm because he wanted greater efforts to end the war.</p>
            <p>Political interests led Dodge in 1864 to become a last-minute candidate for Congress. His Democratic
                    opponent was declared elected, but because of the closeness of the vote and the obvious frauds, the
                    election was appealed to Congress, which finally decided in 1866 that it preferred a Republican to a
                    Democrat. In Congress, Dodge represented the businessman's viewpoint, favoring sound money,
                    aid to the railroads, and a high tariff; this last preference was at least startling, since Dodge
                    was primarily interested in international trade. Concerning Reconstruction he was on the side of
                    moderation, favoring a quick reconciliation between North and South. He refused a second nomination
                    in 1866, but as an indirect result of his short political career, plus his well-known philanthropic
                    impulses, he was appointed by President Grant in 1869 to the Board of Indian Commissioners.</p>
            <p>The present biography of Dodge is based largely on the Dodge papers and other comparable collections
                    of documents. It is meticulously detailed, with often little distinction between the important and
                    the trivial, and the organization is sometimes a trifle confusing. The style is adequate. Seldom
                    does the author make any important effort to sketch the backgrounds and larger implications of the
                    topics about which he talks, and in the places where he makes some such attempts, as with the work
                    of the Board of Indian Commissioners, he frequently leaves much to be desired. Generalizations are
                    few, but they would seem to indicate that while Lowitt is sympathetic to Dodge as an individual, he
                    has an inherent distrust of businessmen—at least of the past century. For example, he
                    makes sweeping criticisms of businessmen in their attitudes toward labor (p. 287) and toward the
                    general public (p. 310), both without supporting evidence. Putting the matter a little more broadly,
                    Lowitt seems to this reviewer not to have a very good grasp of the complexities and contradictions
                    of human nature. All of which should not obscure <pb n="414" id="VAA4025-050-4-098"/> the real
                    services of Lowitt. He has worked diligently on important material, and has made available the
                    details of a significant life. This type of information has been appearing with increasing frequency
                    during recent years, to the pleasure of every student interested in economic trends. Before long it
                    should be adequate to give the basis for a much more valid characterization of the nineteenth
                    century American businessman than any which has appeared to date.</p>

            <p>This volume, the most significant publication connected with <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s sesquicentennial celebration, is basically a reprinting of the earlier
                    one-volume history written by the same authors in 1934. The original printing was exhausted some
                    years ago and it is good to know that so valuable a book is once again available. The six volume
                    history of the state, to which these authors contributed, had not appeared when the original work
                    was published and in the past twenty years many important monographs on <placeName>

                    </placeName> history have been written. The text remains essentially the same, for it was written
                    with care in the first place. Revisions are to be found in the chapter which deals with early <placeName>

                    </placeName> Indians, significant additions have been made to the chapters on social and cultural
                    history, and a final chapter summarizes the events of the past twenty years. Excellent
                    bibliographical essays are included in an appendix.</p>
            <p>The first sentence of the text reads: "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> is a political, not a geographical, unit." Roughly three-fourths of the volume
                    deals with political happenings and these are woven into a clear narrative: a masterpiece of
                    condensation. With the year 1850 this narrative is interrupted by a two-chapter description of
                    social and cultural life and a similar survey entitled "Cultural Progress since
                    1850," is placed towards the end of the book. Chapter XIV deals with "Economic
                    Progress, 1850-1880" and the final chapter contains a survey of the economic woes of the
                    1930's. It is this final chapter <pb n="415" id="VAA4025-050-4-099"/> which caused a mild
                    critical reaction at the time the book appeared, yet the facts presented could be easily
                    substantiated, in the opinion of this writer, and there are remarkably few indications of bias on
                    the part of the authors other than a sympathy for the victims of the Great Depression.</p>
            <p>It is clear, even to the cursory reader, that the authors succeeded admirably in doing what they set
                    out to do. And each reader will think of phases of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s history that have been omitted. The reviewer, because of his own interests,
                    wishes that space might have been found for a chapter on economic problems of the early decades
                    comparable to that for the period 1850-1880. It seems regrettable that no description of the trade

                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> is to be found. One may be certain that the authors felt these omissions even more
                    keenly than does the reader.</p>
            <p>It is a pleasure to praise the format of this book in highest terms. James H. Rodabaugh of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> State Museum served as editor and had supervision of the choice of illustrative
                    materials. The meticulous care given to proofreading and to press work are abundantly evident. The
                    text, as it appeared in 1934, was small octavo and had no illustrations other than maps. The present
                    volume is in the popular quarto size with heavy coated paper admirably suited for the reproduction
                    of half-tones, of which there are approximately three hundred.</p>
            <p>The illustrations are a supplement to the text and little effort is made to tie the two together
                    otherwise than by chronology. For this reason it is to be regretted that a few lines of comment or
                    description were not placed below each cut. To one who is familiar with books about <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> it is refreshing to see pictures which have not before appeared in print. One is
                    especially impressed with the excellence of the drawings which Thomas K. Wharton made of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> country in the 1830's. Few readers will find fault with the choice of pictures
                    and no one can criticize their reproduction. This writer can see no merit in the depiction of Simon
                    Girty (p. 38) and wishes that the cheaply humorous portrayal of the burning of Crawford (p. 42) had
                    not been included, especially since there is reason to question the antiquity of the "old
                    print." He questions the date, "about 1840," of the river scene at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Marietta</settlement>
                    </placeName> painted by Charles Sullivan (p. 92). Full-rigged sea-going vessels, such as are shown

            <p>One might continue this game of minor criticism (why-Governor Ethan Allen <placeName>

                    staff, and craftsmen, for producing a thoroughly satisfying book.</p>

            <p>For some time, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> has needed a general history for both student and non-student. There have been
                    available an ably written college text and several elementary chronologies or histories. The
                    testamentary bequest of John M. Munson, who was long active in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> education, provided that a history of the state be published as well as a history of
                    education in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>. This fund was placed under the trusteeship of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Commission which selected F. Clever Bald as the author for such a project.</p>
            <p>The writing of a general history is a difficult task. Because of its very nature it tends to satisfy
                    fully very few. The professional historian has his special fields of interest and they are seldom if
                    ever covered to the extent or detail of his desire. Even the general reader has local interests and
                    topical prejudices which he often thinks the author should have expanded more completely. Bearing
                    all of these items in mind, <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                        </placeName> in Four Centuries</hi> is a very good general history of the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>One factor which is designed to intrigue and invite the general reader is the liberal use of
                    illustrative materials. Not only are there a substantial number of photographs, but there are also
                    interspersed among the pages a very interesting group of pen drawings by William Thomas Woodward on
                    subjects for which there are no photographs available. Thus is filled a gap, often found in many
                    general histories, which is usually very annoying to the non-professional reader.</p>
            <pb n="417" id="VAA4025-050-4-101"/>
            <p>The photographs themselves are largely a new selection and must not have been used previously in
                    publications. This gives the book a fresh appeal; it is evident that the selection was based on the
                    text of the book, rather than determined by pictorial material readily available.</p>
            <p>There are ten maps included, all of which were executed for this book and, therefore, are integrated
                    with its text rather than being photostats or modifications of existing maps produced for another
                    purpose. This, again, gives clarity to the text and provides a basis of understanding for the
                    reader.</p>
            <p>Bald is to be commended for the intellectual and moral courage needed to write on the more recent
                    past, where the opinions of many readers are rather pronounced and prejudices tend to run strong.
                    Nearly one half of the book deals with the period from the Civil War's beginning to
                    contemporary times. The most common fault of many general histories is that the early period is
                    treated extensively while the area of controversy of more recent years is carefully avoided. Bald
                    has dealt extensively with the more recent past, both with facts and with judgment in selecting
                    fields to be covered. The greatest growth of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> has taken place during this past century, both in population, material and economic
                    development, and institutional and cultural flowering. It is encouraging to read a book for the
                    general reader that is balanced in time and balanced in perspective of the relative importance of
                    the subjects covered. The first chapter, with the intriguing title, "When Elephants Walked
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>," gives an introduction to the geology and physical history of the state. The
                    twenty-nine additional chapters range from Indians to "Armorer to the United
                    Nations." The economic and social history are given significant emphasis, and in an
                    interesting rather than a dutiful manner. Politics and politicians are not eliminated by any means,
                    and their struggles, achievements, and failures are continued up to the very last chapter.</p>
            <p>The including of the chronology is a very real benefit to either the student or the casual reader.
                    Yet, of course, it is a pitfall for the author. Almost every reader will know of things from his
                    experience, his locality, or his travels that he feels should not have been omitted. For instance,
                    the "Griffin," the upper Lakes' first sailing ship, and its voyage of
                    1679 is of <pb n="418" id="VAA4025-050-4-102"/> significance to many. Similarly, the coming of the
                    telegraph to the state, the events of the Civil War, and the coming of the first railroad car ferry
                    in 1869, are matters of interest and curiosity, I am sure, to certain readers. Yet, the chronology
                    is good and is probably already longer than the author would wish.</p>
            <p>The bibliography is entitled, "A Selected List of Books on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> History." It makes no attempt to be an exhaustive bibliography, or to describe
                    the character and scope of the several titles. It is a reading list of general interest on the
                    subject, of titles which might be expected to be found in many local libraries. It is, therefore,
                    tailored for its anticipated reader—to be an asset rather than a source of frustration.
                    The index of fourteen pages should prove very adequate for the students and general public for whom
                    the book was intended.</p>
            <p>I feel that this book will fulfill the hopes of Munson, who made it possible, and the expectations of
                    the Historical Commission of <placeName>

            <p>Through the interest and generosity of the Mayo Association, Philip D. Jordan was provided with the
                    opportunity to write <hi rend="i">The People's Health</hi>, a history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>'s public health program. The writer, an established author and historian,
                    expresses his own basic ideas on the subject by quoting from a recent national report which
                    declares: "Health is not the mere absence of disease but a positive state of body and mind,
                    conducive to full and productive life"; and from Henry I. Bowditch who said that public
                    health is "the most important matter with which any community could concern
                    itself."</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The People's Health</hi> tells about the, unfolding of a great public
                    enterprise in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>. It gives an account of the continuous expansion of the effectiveness and range of
                    sanitary science and preventive medicine. The reader is <pb n="419" id="VAA4025-050-4-103"/>
                    encouraged and inspired by this public health narrative which once more tells how sanitarians have
                    accomplished so much with so little. Though a wide gulf separates the people's
                    understanding from that of their better informed public health leaders, the public plods along,
                    always increasing its pace to provide public health with more active cooperation and better
                    financial support.</p>
            <p>The first two chapters, on the salubrity of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>'s first secretary of the State Health Board, provide a slow start for the
                    monograph. Quickly recovering from these asides, the author writes an unusually fine history. His
                    plan is topical, but he writes at length about the public health activities of three secretaries to
                    the State Health Board: Charles N. Hewitt (1872-1897), Henry M. Bracken (1897-1919), and Albert J.
                    Chesley (1921-). Each of these able men has provided leadership on the national level as well as on
                    the state.</p>
            <p>Although the author immediately calls attention to the omission of a full discussion of finances,
                    organization, and administration, a chapter on each would greatly help the reader and strengthen the
                    book. Judging from material given, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> public health system, administratively, is a state-level organization with little in
                    the way of a local base. Public health officials throughout the state are usually state appointees,
                    and the influence of two large cities has kept the program primarily urban rather than rural. When
                    the legislature rejected the State Board of Health's proposal to establish the county
                    health unit, a plan of eight districts was tried. As is the case in several other states, the
                    district did not prove to be local enough and failed to meet high expectations. Internally, a
                    standard public health organization evolved and, after several reorganizations, on January 1, 1947,
                    there were five sections, as follows: (1) Departmental Administration; (2) Medical Laboratories; (3)
                    Environmental Sanitation; (4) Preventable Diseases; (5) Special Services.</p>
            <p>Quite accurately, the rise and growth of public health nursing are appraised as the foremost of all
                    hopeful developments in public health. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>'s great public health leaders and their achievements are warmly commended, but
                    the writer finds more to condemn than to condone in some phases of his state's public
                    health record. He finds fault with his fellow citizens for tolerating polluted water supplies and
                        <pb n="420" id="VAA4025-050-4-104"/> impure food products and for defeats that public health
                    programs have met in the state legislature.</p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">The People's Health</hi> the reader is given a uniquely comprehensive view
                    of what is taking place in the field of public health generally and what is on the threshold. People
                    are becoming aroused, and part of their concern, identified as a facet of their search for security,
                    is a fear of private medical practice on the one hand or a fear of government intervention on the
                    other. Between these polar positions, according to a statement quoted from a recent federal study on
                    health, "group hospital programs offer the only satisfactory solution." The author
                    sees the federal government as one of the main opportunities to increase the number of physicians,
                    dentists, nurses, health institutions, and hospital beds; and to make these health essentials
                    available to all who need them. Certainly the rapid appearance of hundreds of hospitals and
                    thousands of hospital beds in the last few years seems to justify his viewpoint. The writer takes
                    special note of a recent report made by eight hundred distinguished national leaders which stated
                    "that only a combination of the efforts of local, state, and federal units could possibly
                    result in a major improvement in public health."</p>
            <p>The monograph is a desirable departure from the technical pattern of public health history which
                    prevailed until the First World War. <hi rend="i">The People's Health</hi> is wide in scope
                    and high in reader interest. Its influence will doubtless be very significant as it is a much-needed
                    instrument in behalf of a valuable social program which is dependent upon public appreciation.</p>

            <p>Historians have made a practice to don the hairshirt periodically to force themselves to re-examine
                    the nature of their craft, or is it their art? In 1946, under the auspices of <pb n="421" id="VAA4025-050-4-105"/> the Social Science Research Council, Bulletin 54 appeared: <hi rend="i">Theory and Practice in Historical Study.</hi> It stimulated much discussion and spurred further
                    self-examination. The present cooperative project has for its purpose the "exploration of
                    how historians and other social scientists can better attain profitable intellectual cooperation
                    through more effective knowledge and use of ideas and methods dominant in the various social
                    sciences." From such exploration the authors of the bulletin are hopeful that the
                    boundaries of historical thought will be extended, its purposes clarified, its perspectives
                    sharpened.</p>
            <p>Historians are urged to make more use of the concepts of other social sciences to reorient their own
                    interests and to re-examine their procedures. "Training in thought about history,"
                    say the authors, is "as important as training in any particular type of analysis."
                    But the historian is enjoined to make himself more proficient by levying upon specialized studies of
                    economists, sociologists, statisticians, psychologists, anthropologists, etc. The more the historian
                    concerns himself with interpretation the more needful will be his understanding of the social
                    sciences. Here this bulletin is reaffirming an injunction made familiar to historians these many
                    years through well justified repetition.</p>
            <p>The Bulletin reminds historians that "the central problem of history is the analysis of
                    change," its rate, volume, and direction. And it is their writings which "furnish
                    the materials to guide or at least to justify policies, opinions, and predictions."
                    Historians perform this latter function because they are committed to the belief that
                    "history is not exclusively chaos or chance: a degree of observable order and pattern, of
                    partially predictable regularity, exists in human behavior."</p>
            <p>There will probably be substantial agreement with most of what is presented in this provocative
                    volume. There may be bewilderment, as the authors themselves concede, over the meaning of many of
                    the terms and concepts they have referred to, but the historian is comforted by the observation that
                    in this respect "he is in no worse situation than other social scientists." It
                    seems to this reviewer that insufficient consideration has been given to this problem: how is a
                    historian to gain enough mastery of other fields to be able to distinguish between the sound and the
                    unsound? A little <pb n="422" id="VAA4025-050-4-106"/> knowledge is a dangerous thing, for
                    historians as for others.</p>
            <p>There is an inclination (at least on the part of one contributor) to be too cavalier in dismissing
                    "mere narrative history." He granted its value as
                    "entertainment" but doubted its contribution "toward building a body of
                    scientific knowledge about human behavior." Though Parkman and Henry Adams (to take two of
                    the best of the "narrative" historians) were without benefit of advantages enjoyed
                    by later social scientists, can we truly say our volumes display greater knowledge about human
                    behavior than theirs? Desirable as it is to increase our scientific knowledge about human behavior
                    let us not depreciate the artist to whose vision is often revealed human secrets locked against the
                    tools of the social scientist.</p>
            <p>Many years ago Carl Becker, himself a strong supporter of "the new history,"
                    suggested to a colleague in a tone of mild irritation it was time to produce some of it instead of
                    proposing to one another how it should be written. Possibly the same thought occurred to
                    participants in this enterprise. Indeed some of them have attempted to practice what is preached.
                    Bulletins such as this will surely prompt historians to study their respective fields with greater
                    penetration. More and more the tendency will be to study problems rather than periods. But
                    eventually the effort must be made to synthesize separate studies into a comprehensive narrative.
                    When that work is produced, will our familiar landmarks—the American Revolution, the
                    French Revolution, etc. etc.—look very different than they do now? It will be worth
                    waiting for.</p>

            <p>Largely uninscribed in history books is the variety of beliefs and experiences which make up the
                    lives of ordinary people. Out of the innumerable lives and events of this unrecounted history, a
                    single life or a particular event may be illuminated, partially and arbitrarily, by the inscription
                    on a grave.</p>
            <pb n="423" id="VAA4025-050-4-107"/>
            <p>In this collection of epitaphs Charles Wallis has brought together with a pleasant and informative
                    commentary some 750 inscriptions from American cemeteries. Although epitaphs in general employ
                    traditional forms and sentiments, they are more often than not altered to personal circumstance:
                    Individual attainments, weaknesses, desires and attachments, as well as the whole range of emotional
                    reaction enter into their idiom. Often the comments are blunt and free of the conventions of tact
                    and etiquette within which daily life is hemmed; they express, without restraint, personal hatreds,
                    accusations of crime, extreme egoism, cynicism and even indifference. At the same time, love, faith,
                    grief and individual heroism are amply recorded; the style may be pompous or it may have the awkward
                    simplicity that is so effective and moving in much folk art.</p>
            <p>Religious sentiments range from bright cynicisms such as "Haine Haint" to quiet
                    assurance such as that expressed on a grave in a Friends' cemetery: "I See
                    Daybreak." In between is the whimsical questioner: "Went Away/Mar.22,1921/I
                    Wonder/Where He/Went." Aside from religious sentiment, good deeds or qualities of character
                    may be chosen to record. Sometimes all the memorable aspects of an individual may be listed
                    indiscriminately: "A truthful child, mild tempered, quiet disposition, nearsighted, strong
                    mind." Crimes may also be selected; the dead do not forgive the ill deeds of the living,
                    nor the living the ill deeds of the dead. A <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName> grave recalls: "Henry N…. Murderer of/Sevilla Jones,"
                    while the grave of Warren Gibbs in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> accuses his wife of poisoning the oysters. Those who died unnatural deaths are usually
                    immortalized by them. One cannot fail to be impressed by the marvelous death of one lady of the
                    "Old West": "Margarita/Stabbed by a Gold Dollar." But the
                    ridiculous and the recriminitive are matched by epitaphs of simple pathos and dignity, as these
                    lines on the grave of a young mother: "You must talk to the children/as I should have done
                    had I/lived."</p>
            <p>As in much folksong, there is no avoidance of the morbid. Indeed, the treatment of morbidity may be
                    extremely effective. An epitaph on a child's grave in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> expresses almost a despairing compulsion to view the horror of death: "Oh
                    would that I could lift the lid and peer/within the grave and watch the greedy worms/that eat away
                        <pb n="424" id="VAA4025-050-4-108"/> the dead." Rime may give an unintentional
                    "Charles Addams" kind of humor to a horrible death: "How shocking to the
                    human mind/The log did him to powder grind." Characteristic of these epitaphs is the
                    faculty evident in folk art generally, which combines almost in the same breath and without comment,
                    the sublime with the ridiculous, the individual with the ‘made to order,’ the
                    fantastic with the ordinary.</p>
            <p>The author's commentary which threads these inscriptions together, although at times
                    stilted, adequately fills in the factual background. The book is organized rather loosely by subject
                    matter and the type of sentiment involved; a geographical index at the end of the book is convenient
                    for locating all epitaphs cited from one area. The work makes no pretenses of being other than a
                    pleasant afternoon of reading; it is not directed towards the professional folklorist, although it
                    may well be suggestive to him.</p>

            <p>As a means of making the government records in its care more easily accessible to libraries, research
                    centers, and scholars the National Archives in 1940 instituted a program of microfilming selected
                    groups of its holdings. By June 30, 1953, 4666 rolls of master negative microfilm containing
                    reproductions of more than 3,000,000 pages of records had been completed. These master negatives are
                    kept in the National Archives, but positive prints from them, known as microfilm publications, may
                    be purchased at moderate cost. Whole series of basic documents in American, European, Far Eastern,
                    and Latin American history can thus be obtained at relatively small expense for use outside of <placeName>

            <p>As a part of its program of analyzing and describing the permanently valuable records in its care the
                    National Archives continues to issue Preliminary Inventories and Special Lists. The more recent
                    numbers of these series are listed above. The Preliminary Inventories are of a provisional nature
                    and are issued as soon as possible after the records are received before screening out of disposable
                    material has been finished or the arrangement of the records has been completed. They are primarily
                    for the use of the National Archives Staff in servicing and controlling its materials, but each will
                    be valuable to the scholar interested in the particular records which it covers. The Special Lists
                    are more detailed than the Preliminary Inventories and furnish fuller descriptions of the important
                    record groups included in the series.</p>

            <p>If this mass of 37,000 could be redeemed from anonymity there would be found in it the sternly

                    the trip alone in February, 1856, to join his family. The father had made some name for himself in
                    Indiana as an editor and Whig leader; he and his sons were to become notable figures in <placeName>

            <p>Coker Fifield Clarkson<hi rend="sup">3</hi> (1811-1890), the Hoosier who became a Hawkeye as if to
                    the prairie born, had a career of several phases which contributes much to the theory that in the
                    development of American culture "the wind blew from the East." He was born a
                    down-easter in the Penobscot country<hi rend="sup">4</hi> and might well have grown up to be a

                    who actually in later days was one of the household gods in the Clarkson family and who corresponded
                    with and visited in the home of his son James. On the testimony of this son James we have it that
                    Coker F. Clarkson "loved his birthplace and kept on his tongue always the brogue of the
                    broad a's, o's and r's of the Yankee, and every day of his long life in

            <p>The first phase of his career is that set of forces which we delight to call Heredity and in this
                    case might well be conjured up as The Best of English Middle Class History. Son James was so
                    impressed with this hereditary factor that in 1891 he made a trip to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>

                    rolls, cemeteries, and all other possible sources. If we cannot accept unreservedly the ecstatic

            </p>
            <p>James S. Clarkson, the genealogist of his family, was always eager to claim the name of the famous
                    British abolitionist, Thomas Clarkson (1760-1840), as a forebear, and to rhapsodize over Playford
                    Hall, Thomas' home, as if it were an ancestral seat of the family. This is claiming too
                    much. We may admit him as a collateral member of the line but no more. Thomas Clarkson was the son
                    of a Reverend John Clarkson who kept a free grammar school at Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> According to the tradition handed down to Coker Fifield and from
                    him to others, the American branch of the family traces back to a seventeenth century Clarkson who
                    left Wisbech for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cornwall</settlement>
                    </placeName>; two generations later a son, Richard, came to America as a volunteer member of the
                    forces of Sir Henry <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Clinton</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was wounded in the third and victorious charge made against our men at Bunker Hill;
                    after a period of invalidism he was returned to Britain where shortly he fell in love with a Miss
                    Olivia Perkinhon. Now a bit of old-fashioned romance enters into the story. Olivia was the daughter
                    of a family of some wealth and station who disapproved of her match with the patriotic but probably
                    impecunious soldier. The couple lived up to all the reader's expectations: they eloped and
                    married and came to America. Their first permanent home was in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName> and here their first child was born, a son named Richard Perkinhon in spite of the
                    refusal of the Perkinhons to forgive their headstrong daughter. Four daughters were also born to
                    this union but they do not enter into this story.</p>
            <p>There were other Clarksons who came to America but this Richard Perkinhon, born October 2, 1782, at
                    Stratham near Exeter, <placeName>

                    worker and a tailor. It could not be said of him that he did not try to find a place for himself in

            <p>Now begins another phase of Richard P. Clarkson's career: life on the Indiana frontier. His
                    family seems to have had a normal existence. For some years he rented land, first one place and then
                    another, until 1828 when he bought a farm near <placeName>

                    and wide for his feats of weight-lifting. He was said to have been able to lift a weight of 1400
                    pounds without the aid of straps or any other artificial devices. His eldest daughter, Pamela,

                    he worked in the slack seasons as a laborer on the Miami Canal and whatever he could save went into

                    young man's life; the Clarkson urge to write could not be resisted. In 1838 he asked for

                    sister of his brother-in-law, Joseph Goudie, and yet one more year and he had purchased the paper in

                    1852 the canal's promoters gave up the struggle against nature and the railroad."
                    These years, 1836 to 1852, are the very period when Clarkson was most active as an editor and as a
                    political power who wanted nothing for himself but a great deal for his fellow-citizens. <placeName>

                    better placed for political journalism. As an active and zealous Whig he voted for Henry Clay in
                    1832 and spent much time as his regional campaign manager and tour conductor. He reluctantly
                    switched from Clay to General William Henry Harrison in 1836, feeling that Clay could never bring
                    success to the party. He helped to nominate Harrison again for the 1840 campaign that proved to be
                    so memorable. He entertained General Harrison in his home and helped to direct the canvass in the
                    Western states and might later have claimed a reward had he been interested in that angle of
                        politics.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>Coker F. Clarkson we would call a self-taught and a self-made man. In his <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> days he knew more or less well all the great Whig leaders of the 1830's and
                    1840's; as an editor and an active correspondent seeking out the talent of the times he had
                    contacts with many of the literary lights of the country. He not only survived these tests but came
                    through with honors. We can only marvel at his wide knowledge and his powers of succinct expression.
                    He himself attributed much of his education to his work as a printer at the case and he saw to it
                    that both his sons were well-grounded in the printer's trade.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, home and church life had not been neglected. Four children were born to him and Elizabeth
                    Goudie: Pamela, Frances, Richard Perkinhon (1840), and James Sullivan (1842). The town and
                    countryside were full of the children's relatives. Their father's older sister,
                    Pamela, wife of Goudie, had children who would be "double cousins" to them.
                    Undoubtedly they were brought up in a strict regime. Their father had joined the Methodist Church in
                    1830 at the age of nineteen and remained a loyal member, almost a zealot, until his death in 1890.
                    But we cannot imagine him as one of the "shouting Methodists" so vividly described
                    by R. Carlyle Buley<hi rend="sup">13</hi> and certainly not among those despised by the Quakers, as
                    related by Bernhard Knollenberg.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Of all the "causes" of the
                    times, temperance (later prohibition) was Coker F. Clarkson's greatest love. He helped

                                    instance last year I had rented out considerable of my farm, and my 1/3 of the wheat
                                    amounted to 7 bushels per acre. This at $1.00 per bushel, which is the

                                    worth more than $5 per acre. The same with corn. For my 7/3 of corn I
                                    received 25 bushels per acre. This at 35 cents per bushel is over $8 per

            <p>But politics was James Clarkson's first love and the field of his greatest activity. Like
                    his father before him, he wanted nothing for himself (at this stage) but had very firm notions of
                    what was good for the people. He believed in the divine mission of the Republican Party and in
                    Protection as its gospel. James G. Blaine was his idol and no revelations of irregular sales of
                    railroad bonds ever swerved him from devotion to the man from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName>. Blaine visited him in his home in Des Moines and fully acknowledged his debt to him as
                    his foremost Western spokesman and manager.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1888 the exigencies of local politics plus the unavailability of Blaine made James Clarkson the
                    manager of Senator William B. Allison's effort to secure the Republican nomination for
                    president. He conducted a strenuous pre-convention campaign for Allison against such figures as John
                    Sherman, Walter Q. Gresham, and Benjamin Harrison with Blaine's shadow always hovering over
                    the field. When the convention met in one of the most open contests in Republican history it seemed
                    that any one of the above named plus several lesser lights had a fighting chance to come off with
                    the prize. The final result owed much to Ret Clarkson's surrender to pure
                    sentiment—some would say maudlin sentimentalism. After seven futile ballots spread over
                    several hectic days, he gave the word that shifted <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>'s votes from Allison to Harrison and started the Harrison bandwagon on the
                    road to victory.</p>
            <p>In later years he attributed his action to his love for old Hoosier friends, Louis T. Michener and
                    William W. Dudley, Harrison's managers, and to his desire to fulfill his father's
                    pledge of devotion to the Harrison family. Just as his father had helped to nominate William Henry
                    Harrison in 1839, so <list type="footnotes">

                        <p>"You will never know how much good you did me in your good letters of April
                                    26. They made me feel almost as if I had had a visit with you.</p>
                        <p>"Yes, I remember the conference you and I had in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                                    </placeName> in 1888 a few weeks before the Repn Natl Convention of that year, and
                                    when we practically reached an understanding that my second choice would be Harrison
                                    and that your second choice would be Allison, although we made no positive
                                    agreement; but I always felt after that that if we could not nominate Allison I
                                    would be with you for Harrison. In a way our little visit then saved the final day
                                    for Harrison. For, with my liking for you and other Hoosiers, and my
                                    father's desire to have me support Harrison, I always felt throughout the
                                    long contest at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, when there was so much pressure on me to favor
                                    Sherman—(particularly from his two brothers then living in Des Moines)
                                    and so kept the way open for that. After the last rally on Saturday, after we had
                                    balloted all week, and had failed to form a union on Allison,—which union
                                    came within a breath of accomplishment, and was defeated only by Chauncey Depew
                                    refusing to join the three others of the Big Four of the N.Y.
                                    delegation—and the Convention had met on Monday, Senator Hoar, of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                                    </placeName>, came to me and said ‘I think it is time some one gave way
                                    for the party.’ I said I thought so too, and that I had a letter in my
                                    pocket from Allison authorizing me to withdraw his name whenever I thought it should
                                    be done, but that I would not do that unless we could get a majority of delegates
                                    pledged to some one before we made the new move. He asked me who I thought was the
                                    best man to unite upon, and I told him Harrison, and went on to tell why I thought
                                    so, and told him how much I believed you and Dudley and other Hoosiers had told me
                                    of Harrison that I believed, and then referred to my father's friendship
                                    for the Harrisons and spoke of how my father had gone on <pb n="442" id="VAA4025-050-4-126"/> horseback from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> over the Alleghenies to Harris-burg, Pa. in 1839 to help nominate the
                                    elder Harrison for 1840, and he exclaimed ‘Why my father was a member of
                                    that Convention too, and if the Harrisons were good enough for the elder Clarksons
                                    and Hoars they were certainly good enough for the later ones.’ So we
                                    finally agreed—although the Senator at first was pretty strongly inclined
                                    to Sherman, as they were kinsmen in some degree, and Sherman was very strong in New <placeName>
                                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                                    </placeName>, but we finally agreed we would go together. Then I said ‘if
                                    you will canvass the Eastern delegations I will canvass the Western ones and if we
                                    get a majority of votes pledged I will withdraw Allison's name at the close
                                    of the next ballot, and announce that <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                                    </placeName> was going to support Harrison.’</p>
                        <p>"We made the canvass and after that and after consulting you and Dudley and
                                    finding how many votes you had pledged, found we had a majority for Harrison, and
                                    then proceeded to carry out our programme. My effective plea with the other
                                    delegates was that if we could get a majority of the delegates to go with us, <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                                    </placeName> would withdraw Allison and cast its vote for Harrison. As I was going
                                    back to my seat with the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                                    </placeName> delegation, Senator Quay, who had seen us at work among the delegations
                                    over-took me and asked ‘What are you and old man Hoar up to?’
                                    I told him, and he said it was impossible, and that we hadn't had time to
                                    get such an agreement with so many men. I told him that we had, and added,
                                    ‘We have 18 votes pledged from your own State, headed by Oliver, and you
                                    had better get on the wagon.’ But he wouldn't and stuck by
                                    Sherman. Senator Hoar, in his Autobiography, tells of how nearly we came to
                                    nominating Allison, but I do not remember if he tells our final work together for
                                    Harrison.</p>
                        <p>"This is my recollection of it. At Des Moines that night when the news of
                                    Harrison's nomination came a big crowd of <hi rend="i">enthusiastic

                                    were surprised and of course disappointed over Allison's defeat, and failed
                                    to cheer. My father was in the <hi rend="i">Register</hi> office, and seeing this,
                                    went out on the walk, and hired an express wagon, got into it, and had the driver
                                    drive him into the center of the crowd, and said: ‘Gentlemen, I want to
                                    tell you that no mistake has been made in getting a good candidate for President. I

                                    I want to tell you the kind of men the Harrisons are,’ and then he told

                        <p>The remainder of the story is anticlimax and in many ways a study in frustration.
                                    Half a loaf is poor compensation when one feels entitled to a whole loaf and that
                                    well buttered and sweetened. Ret's old habit of self-denial was no longer
                                    his mood. He wanted and expected a cabinet place as a reward for his key votes in
                                    the convention and for his valiant work as virtual campaign manager carried out in
                                    great difficulty due to a siege of sickness. After many conferences and a strained
                                    relation with Senator Allison, who was playing a very cagey game for himself,
                                    Clarkson ended up with a place as First Assistant Postmaster General in charge of
                                    patronage, with John Wanamaker as the Postmaster General. Clarkson soon acquired an
                                    unsavory reputation for his extreme spoilsmanship, although it must be asserted that
                                    he played the game just like his predecessors and successors, Republicans and
                                    Democrats alike.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>Now he decided to give up the editor's chair at the <hi rend="i">Register</hi> and make his
                    home in the East. This was a momentous decision and was protested by many of his friends. A long
                    study of his papers and some insight into his character leaves this writer with the conviction that
                    Clarkson thought he had outgrown Des Moines and <placeName>

                    Republican League, at best an empty honor. In 1892 he suffered a severe attack of rheumatism and

               </placeName>, was the butt of a strange and
                    unexpected denunciation by Senator Allison, creating a breach which was never fully healed. He
                    accepted Allison's apologies and acted as his manager in the campaign for the nomination in
                    1896 but rather half-heartedly. Perhaps he sensed the futility of it in view of Mark
                    Hanna's masterly campaign for William McKinley.</p>
            <p>In the meanwhile he had to take up other work. He became the president of a bridge construction
                    company which had a contract for a bridge across the Hudson River. He divided his time between <placeName>

                    in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Senate and failed to get even this small plum. In 1900 some of his old friends made an
                    effort to get for him the post of Secretary of the Senate and again failed. This failure he felt
                    quite sure was due to the apathy of Senator Allison who denied the charge. In 1902 his friends tried
                    one more possibility and finally succeeded: President Theodore Roosevelt appointed him to the post
                    of Surveyor of Customs for the Port of <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>From this vantage point he again became a man of some power and of considerable influence in the
                    councils of the party. He seems to have been a personal favorite with President Roosevelt and was a
                    frequent guest at the White House. Among other accomplishments was his introduction and sponsoring
                    of an interesting Hoosier-Hawkeye, Leigh Smith James Hunt, who had made a fortune in Korean
                    gold-mining and Sudanese cotton plantations. Hunt was probably one of those who planted the notion
                    of an African big game hunt in Roosevelt's head and certainly was one who gave expert
                    information to the planners of the trip. A fortunate investment by Clarkson in Hunt's

                    momentum under Ret that it could carry on for years as the leading paper of the state. R. P.
                    Clarkson, as he was known, was a man of the finest character and highest ideals and firmest will
                    imagineable but he lacked the sparkle of Ret's literary style and he suffered from an air
                    of reserve brought on by deafness. After running the paper since 1888 he finally brought himself to
                    part with it in 1902 by selling to a syndicate headed by George E. Roberts of Fort Dodge, Director
                    of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Here he and his wife, Anna Howell Clarkson, lived with their son, Coker Fifield
                    Clarkson and his wife, Lucy Miller Corkhill Clarkson, granddaughter of Justice Samuel Freeman
                    Miller, and their daughter, Olivia, on whom he doted in the best grandfatherly fashion.</p>
