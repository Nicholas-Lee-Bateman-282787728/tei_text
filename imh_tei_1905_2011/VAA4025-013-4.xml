                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, uncle of the President, to Indiana was some four years prior to
                    the admission of the State into the Union. It appears that he, like many others
                    who lived in slave territory, hearing of the fine prospects in the
                    "Indian country to the north," joined the tide of emigrants
                    coming up from the south, and with no particular objective in view journeyed out
                    into this wilderness, not knowing whither he went save that, in common with
                    substantially all of the pioneers, he did not stop until the great oak forests
                    in the hills were reached, where there was abundant, ever-flowing springs of
                    clear water.</p>
            <p>The location chosen was in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harrison</settlement>
                    </placeName> county, where, at the little town of Corydon, was then located the
                    seat of government of the territory, which four years after his arrival became
                    the capital of the State. The land which he selected was originally covered with
                    a heavy growth of timber, was well watered and doubtless was considered a good
                    location by the pioneer; but it is now largely barren and comparatively
                    valueless.</p>
            <p>Thomas <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, the father of the President and younger brother of Josiah, came on
                    a visit to this section of the State <pb n="308" id="VAA4025-013-4-002"/> a
                    short while prior to his own removal from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer</region>
                    </placeName> county, Indiana. The inhabitants of the territory at the time of
                    Thomas <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s visit were looking forward to its early admission into
                    the Union. It was while visiting his brother that Thomas <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> decided to seek a home in the wilderness of Indiana, making choice
                    of a place a few miles farther west.</p>
            <p>Comparatively little is known of Josiah <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>. However, what is remembered possesses at least some value as
                    setting forth certain family traits. In personal appearance he somewhat
                    resembled his brother Thomas, being rather rugged, compactly built, of dark
                    complexion—as were all of his descendants. Moreover, he had a broad,
                    hearty laugh and was given to story telling. The writer personally knew the
                    older descendants of Josiah <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, as well as those of the generation following.</p>
            <p>All of the Lincolns in Indiana during the campaign of 1860 were Democrats and
                    voted for Judge Douglas for President in preference to their illustrious
                    kinsman, with the single exception of Benjamin. He was early influenced
                    politically and otherwise by his mother's relatives, who were
                    Republicans, and this accounts for the support given to his relative rather than
                    any ties of consanguinity or mere family loyalty. Moreover, the larger portion
                    of the younger Lincolns have ever been and are now Democrats. Only one of this
                    branch of the family became a Civil war soldier, and he, Warden <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, having volunteered and been mustered into the ranks under the
                    excitement of the times, found occasion later, as claimed by some of his
                    relatives, to express regret at having enlisted, but he made a good soldier,
                    serving as a private. He had the misfortune of being taken prisoner and for a
                    time was in Libby prison, but being later placed on Belle Isle, was exchanged
                    and reached home. Doubtless, had it been known by those in authority at the
                    prison that he was a cousin of the Abolitionist in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> House, he would not have been granted his freedom.</p>
            <p>Mordecai and Joseph, brothers of Warden, were drafted. Mordecai, not desirous of
                    personally serving, sent a substitute, while Joseph, entertaining the same
                    attitude in the <pb n="309" id="VAA4025-013-4-003"/>

                    <pb n="310" id="VAA4025-013-4-004"/> matter, and not being possessed of
                    sufficient means to obtain a substitute, took French leave, so his relatives
                    assert, of Indiana and succeeded in eluding the authorities by repairing to the
                    State of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> until after the close of hostilities. The political attitude of
                    these Lincolns toward their kinsman in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> House, and their criticism of the conduct of the war by the
                    administration, were in keeping with the attitude of many of their neighbors in
                    southern Indiana, and indeed of many throughout the entire North.</p>
            <p>Southern Indiana and southern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, both having been very largely peopled from the South, it was not
                    strange that there was a large element whose sympathies were favorable to the
                    Southern Confederacy. But there were large numbers in both States, many of them
                    friends and supporters of Judge Douglas, who were intensely loyal to the Union.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, however, was more fortunate than was Indiana in one very important
                    particular, in that General John A. Logan, a Democrat up to the fall of Fort
                    Sumter and for some time thereafter, resided in that section of the State, and
                    being loyal to the flag wielded a salutary influence over his followers.</p>
            <p>The southern portion of Indiana did not possess a leader of the prominence of
                    Logan to turn the tide in favor of the Union in this crisis. There is small
                    wonder that the Knights of the Golden Circle and kindred disloyal organizations
                    flourished. But notwithstanding this, the majority of the soldiers who went out
                    from first to last during the great war from southern Indiana were Democrats.</p>
            <p>The writer's father was a Douglas Democrat, casting his vote for the
                    "Little Giant" in preference to the
                    "Railsplitter," and never manifested at any time any
                    partiality for <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>. While he saw no military service, being an invalid, three of his
                    brothers served the Union.</p>
            <p>Practically all of the numerous descendants of Josiah <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> were and are rather short of stature, maintaining to the latest
                    generation those characteristics manifested in their progenitor and which may be
                    said to be distinctively <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> traits.</p>
            <p>They almost uniformly have coarse black hair, dark eyes, <pb n="311" id="VAA4025-013-4-005"/> and somewhat given to humor which in certain
                    instances has been quite marked. For the most part they have been small farmers,
                    the exception being that two of them for a time, like their cousin Abraham,
                    attempted to keep a general store, and it was attended with about as much
                    success as was his venture—"it winked out." One of
                    the younger generation, Joseph, the son of Mordecai, is an auctioneer, and he
                    especially possesses some degree of wit and humor.</p>
            <p>This branch of the President's family have always been regarded by their
                    neighbors as good citizens, possessing splendid neighborly qualities. All of
                    them have been, and are poor, yet honesty has ever characterized them. They have
                    always had the reputation of being peaceful and inoffensive, possessing in
                    substantially every instance a high sense of honor; and if any liberties were
                    attempted with this, or intentional provocation in any form given, it was met
                    with a challenge to a personal encounter. The absence of personal fear or
                    cowardice is very marked among them and in certain ones there was a venturesome
                    spirit. The writer well recalls hearing "Mord" <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> say: "My rule for fording Big Blue when she's on
                    a tear is: watch for the hosses' ears and as long as I c'n see
                    'em I'm all right."</p>
            <p>While none of the Indiana Lincolns possessed unusual physical strength or marked
                    mental ability, yet they were generally hardy and rugged, and occasionally there
                    was one who in the common schools gave evidence of possessing more than
                    ordinary, ability. However, their schooling has been confined to the grades in
                    substantially every case.</p>
            <p>They have maintained certain family names, such as Mordecai, Joseph, Thomas and
                    Benjamin, but there has never been an Abraham among them, and it is highly
                    probable that there never will be. It should be stated, however, that one son of
                    Warden, who served in the Union army during the Civil war, is called
                    "Abe," not by the family, but by his schoolmates and others
                    merely as a nickname.</p>
            <p>During the Civil war when there were those in this section of the State
                    accustomed to indulge in caustic criticism of the administration at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> in conducting the war and of Mr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> in particular, calling him "the Black
                    Abolitionist," <pb n="312" id="VAA4025-013-4-006"/> etc., none of his
                    Indiana relatives resented this, and while they did not agree with their kinsman
                    in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> House politically, they refrained from indulging in the use of
                    severe and clearly objectionable personal remarks themselves. Yet they were
                    pleased rather than not when others pointed out mistakes of the administration.</p>
            <p>After the close of the war they assumed an attitude of silence to the rising fame
                    of the President, neither manifesting pleasure nor indicating any displeasure,
                    and this attitude has been kept up to the present time; so much so, in fact,
                    that in almost every instance when approached and engaged in conversation
                    concerning the Great Emancipator they assume a listening attitude, apparently
                    proud of the great fame of their kinsman Abraham, but loath to say anything
                    themselves, The writer does not recall ever hearing an Indiana <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> indulge in any language that could by any possible construction be
                    construed to mean a boast of his relationship to the President.</p>
            <p>It may be said, therefore, that the attitude of this branch of the Lincolns
                    toward the President is that they are proud of the fact that their kinsman
                    became illustrious and made for himself a great name, but they are in every case
                    quite content to look upon this in common with the millions, not desirous at all
                    of receiving any notoriety by reason of their kinship to him. This rather
                    exceptional disposition is not due to any petty jealousy, certainly not
                    attributable to ignorance or any remnant of ante-bellum political prejudice, but
                    is rather due to a distinctive family trait so remarkable as to be true of all
                    of them; that is, they possess a mingled modesty and honesty which forbids undue
                    personal exaltation or any disposition whatever to reap where they have not
                    sown.</p>
            <p>The political predilections of the Indiana Lincolns is not a thing to be regarded
                    as at all strange or such as to occasion wonder, since the earlier members of
                    the family, including Thomas, the father of the President, and even the
                    President himself, were all Democrats in politics originally. Before his leaving
                    Indiana for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Abraham was a pronounced Jacksonian Democrat, priding himself in
                    this, and John Hanks is the authority for saying that he offered to whip a man;

            <p>The manner of life of the older members of the Indiana Lincolns, their personal
                    appearance, their contentment and indeed joy amid struggles with poverty, bear a
                    marked similarity to that of Thomas, the father of the President, so that it may
                    be said that their life was lived on a somewhat similar plane to his. Although
                    the location of the President's boyhood home in <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> settled and where may still be found many of his descendants, yet
                    none of these has ever visited this section, and not one of them was present on
                    the occasion of the unveiling of the Nancy Hanks <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> monument in the year 1902. Likewise, none of these Indiana
                    relatives has ever made a pilgrimage to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> to see the grave of the President, or gone to the nation's
                    capitol.</p>
            <p>If there is discerned in the President's paternal relatives a reticence
                    somewhat exceptional, as well as a disposition to avoid any accusation of
                    desiring to take advantage of or in any way profit by the good fortune of a
                    kinsman, it certainly stands out in bold contrast to the behavior of all of his
                    maternal relatives, the Hankses, who straightway importuned Mr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> to befriend them on his accession to the presidency, a thing,
                    however, which he failed to do. The Indiana branch of the President's
                    family never so much as wrote him a letter or in any other way attempted to
                    communicate with him for any assistance looking to the liberation of Warden <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> from a southern prison, where he was known to be undergoing all of
                    the usual discomforts of prison life, perhaps suffering some indignities by
                    reason of his name and blood.</p>
            <p>In seeking to account for Mr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s greatness it is therefore not at all necessary to resort
                    to certain doubtful <pb n="314" id="VAA4025-013-4-008"/> expedients or envelop
                    his fame in mystery, as smoe have been disposed to do. Such persons have gone to
                    the extreme of lightly esteeming both his maternal and paternal ancestry, and
                    have attributed his uncommon endowment to the example and influence of his
                    stepmother, Mrs. Sally Bush <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>. Others, by reason of the obscure origin of his mother, Nancy
                    Hanks, have supposed that his greatness is traceable to this source, and yet
                    still others, going on the theory that it was necessary to have a great ancestry
                    in order to account for such a remarkable man as was Mr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, eagerly sought to trace some connection with the noted <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> family of the East, and when it became apparent that they were of
                    common origin this was seized upon and became all that in their estimation had
                    hitherto been found wanting. The proper attitude concerning the matter, it
                    seems, would be that Mr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> was indebted equally to both the Lincolns and the Hankses for
                    certain well-known traits of his character, but since the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> traits unquestionably predominated in him and his connection with
                    the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Lincolns has been established, the historian is relieved from the
                    temptation of overshadowing his life with certain elements of mystery. For no
                    matter what currents swept into his blood, and whatever in his character may be
                    attributable to these, the fact remains that the President possessed those
                    well-marked family characteristics, both physical and mental, so peculiar to the
                    Lincolns.</p>

                    </placeName>, father of Thomas, appears to have been a man of passing wealth for
                    that day. On his reaching <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> from <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the year 1780, he entered on large tracts of land, and was
                    apparently destined to prosper; but subjected as the pioneers were to the
                    depredations of marauding Indians, he fell a victim to these vindictive and
                    merciless foes in the year 1788. The story of the manner of his death and some
                    of the attendant circumstances have often been related by biographers of his
                    grandson.</p>
            <pb n="315" id="VAA4025-013-4-009"/>
            <p>This story was one of the legacies of pioneer days bequeathed to his sons by
                    Josiah <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>. This and other stories, they allege, were often related by him
                    about the fireside on winter evenings, describing somewhat in detail this
                    particularly tragic scene. He told of the father being shot and killed from
                    ambush by the bloodthirsty savages while he was laboring in a clearing a short
                    distance from the house, accompanied by his three sons, Mordecai, himself, and
                    Thomas, the father of the President. When the shot was fired and the father
                    fell, both Mord and Josiah immediately fled, Mord going to the house to secure a
                    gun. Taking deliberate aim at an ornament on the breast of an Indian brave, who,
                    with uplifted tomahawk, was in the act of dispatching his baby brother Thomas,
                    he fired, killing him instanly. Josiah having left his brother Mord to the
                    protection of the two sisters and his mother, ran for neighborly aid, which he
                    straightway procured, and on their return all the Indians had departed, save a
                    wounded one, who had crawled into the top of a fallen tree. No quarter was shown
                    to this unfortunate, and while the circumstance produced in Mord such
                    ungovernable hatred for the redskins as to cause him to slay them on the least
                    provocation, or no provocation at all, ever afterward, yet it does not appear
                    that it so affected either Thomas or Josiah.</p>
            <p>Although the elder <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> possessed large tracts of land, yet the old law of primogeniture
                    caused his entire estate to pass into the hands of his eldest son, Mord, who, it
                    appears, did not in any way aid his brothers. He managed so poorly as to possess
                    but little more than either Josiah or Thomas on the occasion of his removal from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, which date is not certain, but is known to have been after
                    approaching old age.</p>
            <p>At the time of the father's death in the year 1788, Thomas, the fourth
                    child and youngest son, was ten years of age. Thus? left fatherless at the same
                    age that his illustrious son was bereft of a mother, he led a somewhat checkered
                    career. He became more or less a wanderer, for we catch glimpses of him visiting
                    and laboring as a "hired man" for his uncle Jacob on a
                    tributary of the Holston river in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>; then in Breckenridge county, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, where at one time he whipped <pb n="316" id="VAA4025-013-4-010"/>
                    a noted bully in "just three minutes," coming out of the
                    encounter without a scratch. In 1803, at the age of twenty-five, he purchased a
                    farm, and in the year 1806 he was in Hardin county, learning the
                    carpenter's trade with Joseph Hanks. His vagrant and wandering career
                    had given him a plentiful supply of anecdotes and yarns, which it is said he
                    could tell very cleverly, and which was perhaps one of the best, if not the
                    only, trait ever certainly bequeathed by him to his son Abraham.</p>
            <p>The father of the President has been described by numerous writers as being in
                    person comparatively short and stout, standing five feet, ten inches in his
                    shoes. His hair was dark and coarse, complexion brown, his face round and full,
                    his eyes gray, and his nose large and prominent. He weighed at different times
                    from one hundred and seventy to one hundred and ninety-six pounds. He was so
                    "tight and compact" that Dennis Hanks declared, "he
                    never could find the points of separation between his ribs, though he felt for
                    them often." He was a little stoop-shouldered, and walked with a slow,
                    halting step. He was sinewy and brave, but his habitually peaceable disposition
                    once fairly overborne, he became a tremendous man in a rough-and-tumble fight.</p>
            <p>At the time of his marriage to Nancy Hanks, June 12th, 1806, Thomas <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> could neither read nor write, an accomplishment that his wife
                    possessed, thereby causing her to be esteemed and looked upon with more or less
                    wonder by the illiterate pioneers. This circumstance, by way of contrast with
                    her husband's deficiency in this and certain other things,
                    unfortunately caused many of her son's biographers, in attempting to
                    eulogize the wife and mother, to esteem lightly whatever of excellence Thomas <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> possessed.</p>
            <p>It has been the fashion of many of these biographers of President <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> to speak disparagingly of his father, and no word in any caricature
                    of his supposed shortcomings has been used more often than that of
                    "shiftless." They have accused him of improvidence; made the
                    occasion of his learning the carpenter's trade a mere pretext; and
                    refused to allow that he was anything more than a pretender with tools after
                    actually learning the trade and doing more or less work. They <pb n="317" id="VAA4025-013-4-011"/> have found fault with his lack of ambition. They
                    charge him with inability to pay for a farm of some two hundred acres which he
                    purchased at the age of twenty-five years, three years prior to his marriage.
                    They have professed to see in his three removals in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, his going from that State to Indiana, thence to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and two or three changes of location in that State, nothing but
                    evidence of a confirmed nomadic wanderer. These and many similar accusations
                    against him have been made from the first biography of his son to the last.</p>
            <p>When the governor of a certain State on one occasion expostulated with his aged
                    mother for granting certain indlgencies to his little son, she straightway
                    admonished him by saying: "When you, sir, shall have reared as good and
                    great a son as I have, then you may come to me with your theories and they shall
                    receive due and proper consideration, but not before." So in like
                    manner, when these ruthless, not to say heartless, critics of Thomas <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, the father of the President, shall take into consideration the
                    fact that while he did have certain defects of character, even to the point of
                    being actually shiftless, yet be it said to his everlasting credit that no man
                    since the world began has ever been father of such a son.</p>
            <p>It is submitted that for a boy fatherless at ten, "kicked and cuffed
                    about from pillar to post", with no money nor influential friends, with
                    absolutely no school advantages—certainly not having the chance that
                    his son had, and yet accomplishing certain things—he deserves some
                    credit at least. He appears to have been steady enough and sufficiently settled
                    in life not only to learn a trade, but to become the owner of a farm at
                    twenty-five, which fact alone indicates at least that he had some native ability
                    and force of character. It is related that he possessed the best kit of
                    carpenter's tools in his county. He was regarded as a man possessed of
                    sufficient ability to warrant the civil authorities in appointing him road
                    surveyor or supervisor, which, while a position of no great moment, meant
                    something in the way of leadership and responsibility. When all these facts are
                    taken into consideration it must be said that Thomas <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> was a man of some <pb n="318" id="VAA4025-013-4-012"/> ability, and
                    certainly not deserving the treatment that he has received at the hands of the
                    biographers of his son.</p>
            <p>Some time during the late summer of the year 1816 Thomas <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> built a raft on Rolling Fork of Salt river, on which he loaded most
                    of his effects, consisting of a tool chest, a number of barrels of whiskey, and
                    such other things as he possessed, save a few lighter and more needful household
                    articles which his family would make use of in his absence. He proceeded to make
                    a journey down Salt river to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and thence to Indiana, where he had decided to seek his fortunes in
                    an effort to better his condition.</p>
            <p>That the elder <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> was of a restless and roving disposition is beyond dispute, and his
                    repeated removals "to better his condition" to some extent
                    justify the many charges of his biographers of his being a mere wanderer and
                    squatter. In spite of the apparent justness of these accusations, most of these
                    proposed ventures promised well, and certainly in some one or two instances
                    there was abundant excuse for the venture made. We have the best of
                    authority—his illustrious son—for believing that he was
                    actuated by good and sufficient motives for his removal from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> to Indiana; and it appears that no better reasons were ever offered
                    by any pioneer for a change of location than those in favor of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s removal from Indiana to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> in 1830. President <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, in discussing the reasons for their leaving the State of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, said that it was "partly on account of slavery, but
                    chiefly on account of the difficulty in land titles in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>." It should be remembered also that for some seven
                    generations the family had been pioneers in as many States or counties, and
                    Thomas <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> was but manifesting the same disposition that appears to have
                    possessed his forbears.</p>
            <p>Being a carpenter, it is to be presumed that the elder <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> had no difficulty in constructing a craft that under ordinary
                    circumstances would prove seaworthy. It is believed that in view of the fact
                    that he had made at least two flat-boat trips down the <geogName>Mississippi
                        river</geogName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he was a fairly good waterman. On this trip soon after entering
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> from the mouth of Salt river his boat or raft capsized, causing the
                    loss of the larger part of his cargo. We are told, <pb n="319" id="VAA4025-013-4-013"/> however, that he succeeded in righting the raft,
                    fishing up some of the whisky and tools, and contenting himself as best he could
                    with the loss of the remainder, he continued his journey, finally docking at
                    Thompson's, now called Gage's Landing, a short distance below
                    the town of Troy, Indiana. His reason for choosing <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer</region>
                    </placeName> county rather than settling near his brother Josiah in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harrison</settlement>
                    </placeName> county was largely due to the fact that he was dependent upon the
                    river for conveyance of his effects to a new location, and having "run
                    the river" he had some knowledge of this region where he eventually
                    located.</p>
            <p>After making his lonely journey and effecting a safe landing at
                    Thompson's, he placed his cargo under the care of a settler by the name
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey</region>
                    </placeName>. Since this man preferred the river front to the interior, and
                    could make use of the boat, it was sold to him, and the pioneer "struck
                    out on foot" in the wilderness in search of a new home. After going
                    inland some fifteen miles he met with a man by the name of Carter, with whom he
                    had more or less acquaintance. (<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> City is in Carter township.) This circumstance seems to have
                    largely determined his choice of the location which he made in the
                    "midst of the bush". There were seven families residing in
                    this region when Thomas <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> made choice of his future home.</p>
            <p>The site chosen by Thomas <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> was admirable from every standpoint save one, and that defect
                    outweighed all of the splendid advantages it otherwise possessed. It did not
                    have a never-failing spring; in fact, there was not at that time any water on
                    it. Later, as Dennis Hanks stated, "Tom <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> riddled his land like a honey comb for water, but did not succeed
                    in finding it."</p>
            <p>Although <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> proceeded to take possession of the quarter section of land in true
                    pioneer fashion by cutting and piling brush at the corners, he became in fact a
                    squatter until the month of October, 1817, when he journeyed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and formally entered the land, although the patent was not issued
                    until June, 1827.</p>
            <p>The site chosen for his "camp" was on a rather high knoll
                    sloping in every direction. In ten days after landing his craft <pb n="320" id="VAA4025-013-4-014"/> at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey</region>
                    </placeName>'s he announced that his "half faced
                    camp" was ready for occupancy, having in that time cut the poles or
                    logs and notched them, doubtless being assisted by Carter and others. Crossing
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, he walked back to the old home in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>—a distance of about one hundred miles—and
                    securing the friendly aid of his brother-in-law, who supplied him with two
                    horses, he took his little family, consisting of his wife, his daughter Sarah,
                    aged nine, and son Abraham, aged seven, and "packed through to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey</region>
                    </placeName>'s".</p>
            <p>The town of Troy was at this time a place of some importance ; indeed, of all
                    those towns in the southern and western portion of the State, it was second only
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> in size. In the year prior to the coming of the Lincolns a settler
                    by the name of Hoskins had been employed to blaze a trail from Troy to the
                    village of Darlington, the county-seat town to the west, in order that
                    "the mail carrier might not get lost". This blazed trail
                    passed through the region where Gentryville was a little later laid out, and it
                    was over this trail, a "bridle path", that Thomas <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> moved his family and household effects to his new home. A wagon had
                    in some manner been procured for this purpose, although such vehicles were not
                    at all common, for the first wagon brought to this part of the State was by one
                    John Small, a Kentuckian, in the year 1814.</p>
            <p>After encountering considerable difficulty on account of felling trees and the
                    removal of logs, making their comparatively short journey of fifteen miles a
                    very tedious and trying one, they at length reached the half-faced camp. The
                    time of the arrival of the new "settlers" was during the last
                    half of the summer of 1816. At any rate, it appears that sufficient time was
                    left after their arrival to enable them to cultivate "a few vegetables
                    and a little corn."</p>
            <p>The new home to which Thomas <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> took his little family was a singular one indeed. As has been
                    indicated, it was made of small sapling logs or poles and had but three sides
                    closed, the fourth being left open, where a bonfire or log heap was kept burning
                    during cold weather, and not only served to ward off the wintry blasts, but
                    afforded the only means they had for cooking. The little, one-room, pole cabin
                    was fourteen feet square, without windows, ceiling or floor, <pb n="321" id="VAA4025-013-4-015"/> and of course there was no necessity for a door.
                    The household and kitchen furniture was only such in name. Aside from a small
                    amount of bedding, a Dutch oven, skillet and some tinware, there was at first
                    nothing with which to furnish the home. A rude bedstead was constructed in one
                    corner, and in another corner a pile of leaves gathered from the surrounding
                    forest constituted the couch of the future President.</p>
            <p>The woods surrounding the cabin furnished an abundant harvest of wild grapes,
                    crab apples (Johnny Appleseed had unfortunately never reached this section),
                    service (sarvis), black and strawberries were quite plentiful.</p>
            <p>The writer recalls hearing his grandmother (who came from the South a short while
                    after the coming of the Lin-colns) tell of the abundance of wild strawberries in
                    this region. They drove through acres of these berries, and so luxuriant were
                    the vines and so plentiful the harvest that the limbs and even portions of the
                    body of a white horse were discolored, as if the animal had waded in blood.
                    There were nuts of various sorts to be had in the forest, such as hickory,
                    pecan, hazel, and the white and black walnut. Moreover, the virgin forest was a
                    hunter's paradise, there being bears, deer and choice wild fowls, such
                    as turkeys, geese and ducks. In addition to these, there were the smaller game
                    birds and animals. Any undue amount of pity and sympathy bestowed on pioneers
                    dwelling in such a land of plenty is wasted. While not perhaps flowing with milk
                    and honey, yet in so far as the mere matter of supplying the larder was
                    concerned it could scarcely have been more highly favored. There is small wonder
                    that Dennis Hanks was moved to exclaim in his old age, when recalling these
                    years spent in Indiana: "I enjoyed myself then more than I ever have
                    since."</p>
            <p>The first winter spent in Indiana was, so far as bodily comfort was concerned,
                    the most trying time in the life of the future President, as he lived quite on
                    the level, if not below, that of thousands of slaves whom he afterward
                    liberated. With one side of their little cabin open to the elements and the
                    rebellious smoke again and again sweeping into the camp, it furnished not only a
                    striking contrast to the later life of the President, but so far surpassing
                    anything in history as to leave little chance for a parallel.</p>
            <pb n="322" id="VAA4025-013-4-016"/>
            <p>The elder <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> has been censured from first to last for his failure to provide
                    better accommodations not only during the first year of his Indiana life, but is
                    charged with continued improvidence and neglect, being called lazy by many of
                    the biographers of his son. It must be remembered in speaking of Thomas <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s poverty that while he was poor indeed, yet poverty was
                    quite the rule of all the pioneers of this early period. Though it can not be
                    claimed that he was especially "work brittle" and ambitious
                    enough to go out and seek labor, yet he never avoided work offered. He seems to
                    have rested upon that passage of Scripture which says to let every day provide
                    for itself. Nevertheless, the writer failed to find among his pioneer neighbors
                    any charge that Thomas <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, and his son Abraham in particular, were "lazy".
                    On the contrary, it was asserted that while the elder <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> lacked initiative, taking life quite easy, he was content if
                    perchance crops were abundant and labor to be had. When the morose and gloomy
                    made doleful prophecies as to a hard winter and failure of crops, he was buoyant
                    in spirit, optimistic, laughing and even joking with his neighbors concerning
                    their fears. Although not regarded as a hard-working man for himself, he made a
                    "good hand for others" and was at work almost continually.</p>
            <p>So much has been said concerning the poverty of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s youth that it is proposed here to examine the evidence
                    from an angle hitherto not taken. One of the boyhood friends of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, Wesley Hall, some two years younger than the President, related a
                    number of incidents concerning this period, and one in particular bearing upon
                    his poverty.</p>
            <p>Wesley Hall's father was a Kentuckian who had moved to Indiana, settling
                    some four miles from the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> cabin, but reaching this section some time after the coming of the
                    Lincolns. The elder Hall was regarded as quite prosperous for one in those days.
                    Furnishing some justification for this claim, he operated a tanyard, in addition
                    to owning and cultivating a large farm, making shipments of leather by way of
                    the river to southern markets. This necessitated at certain times the employment
                    of a number of men, and he frequently employed both the elder <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, as well as his son Abraham.</p>
            <pb n="323" id="VAA4025-013-4-017"/>
            <p>On one occasion during the early winter Wesley Hall was sent to mill beyond
                    Gentryville, a short distance from the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> cabin, but since the Halls lived to the east some four miles it was
                    more than a five miles' journey. According to the pioneer custom, no
                    favors were shown youth or age in certain things, and the rule especially
                    obtained in the matter of going to mill, for each one had to "take his
                    turn." Such was the law.</p>
            <p>Young Hall found upon his arrival on this occasion that a number of men and boys
                    had preceded him, and by the time his turn came the entire day had almost
                    passed. During the last half of the afternoon a severe snow storm had set in,
                    and by the time the miller carried out his "grist" and
                    assisted him to mount preparatory to making the homeward journey some inches of
                    snow had fallen. This alarmed the pioneer lad, lest some mishap should befall
                    him and he should lose his way through the forest, become a prey to wild
                    animals, or succumb to the cold. More especially was he so impressed since
                    nightfall was fast approaching and the snow was driving furiously in his face.
                    On reaching the turn in the road leading up to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> cabin he decided to go there for the night. Riding up in front of
                    the silent, snow-mantled house, he hallooed in true pioneer fashion a time or
                    two: "Hel-lo! Hel-lo!" Just here it will be proper to permit
                    Mr. Hall to tell the remainder of his story: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Bye and bye I heard the door begin to creak on its wooden hinges, and
                            then through the storm I saw old Tom a shadin<hi rend="sup">∗</hi> his eyes with his hand a tryin' to see who I
                            wuz. And purty soon, satisfying himself that it wuz me, he leaned back
                            and laughed a big broad laugh, and then a startin' out to where
                            I wuz he says, says he: "Is that you AVesley? You get down from
                            thar and come in out of the weather." So I commenct to git
                            ready to slide off my sack and by the time I got ready to light, old Tom
                            wuz there and helped me down. Then a turain' around
                            lookiu' towards the cabin, he calls out a time or two, big and
                            loud: "Abe! O. Abe! Abe!" And he aint more'n
                            called till I seen Abe <hi rend="i">a</hi> couiin' through the
                            door, and when he asked what wuz wanted, and secin' who 1 wuz
                            at the same time, old Tom says: "Come out here and git
                            Wesley's grist while I put his boss in the stable.
                            Wesley's mighty nigh froze I reckon." Then he laughed
                            again. Well, I wuz cold I c'n tell you fer I hadn't
                            had anything to eat ceptin' parched corn since
                            mornin'. Well, as I say, old Tom told Abe to come and get my
                            sack, and I noticed as Abe come out to <pb n="324" id="VAA4025-013-4-018"/> where I wuz he hadn't but one shoe
                            on, and thinks I to myself, what's up with Abe fer I saw Abe
                            wuz a walkin' on the ball of his heel so's to hold his
                            big toe up which wuz all tied up, and by this time I reckon there wuz
                            mighty nigh six Inches of snow on the ground. Yit Abe's foot
                            wuz so big and long it didn't make no difference if the snow
                            wuz that deep. Abe hadn't any trouble about a keepin'
                            his sore toe above the snow line. When I asked him what wuz the matter
                            with his foot he told me he'd split his big toe open with an ax
                            out in the clearin' that day. Well, Abe then wuz as big and
                            stout as he ever wuz, and so he jest reached over and took that sack of
                            meal with one hand and layin' it across his arm, him and me
                            went into the house while old Tom put the hoss in the pole stable.</p>
                        <p>I set down in front of the fireplace and comiuenct to thaw out, and in a
                            little bit old Tom come in, and a settin' down by me a
                            slappin' his hands together and then a rubbin' em so,
                            like he alius' done, he says, says he: "Wesley, you
                            got purty cold I reckon, did you?" And when I commenct to say I
                            did, Mrs. <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                            </placeName> come in and she says, after we'd passed the time
                            of day, she says, says she: "Wesley, I reckon you're
                            hungry." And I told her I wuz; and then I told her about the
                            parched corn. And she says: "We haint got no meal to bake
                            bread. We're out just now, but a pointin' to the big
                            bank of embers that I'd already noticed in the fireplace and of
                            course knowd what it meant, she says, says she, "we've
                            got some potatoes in thar a bakin' and we'll git a
                            bite fer you purty soon." At that I spoke up and I says, says
                            I: "Mrs. <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                            </placeName>, jist help yerself out of my sack thar." And so
                            she done as I told her.</p>
                        <p>Well, old Tom and Abe and me went on a talkin' and purty soon I
                            heard a funny grindin' noise back of me, and I looked around to
                            see what it wuz, and it wuz Mrs. <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                            </placeName> a hollerin' out a big turnip.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Just at this point in Mr. Hall's narrative he paused and asked the
                    writer if he could guess what Mrs. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> was "hollerin' out that turnip fer".
                    When some two or three attempts had been made to solve this mystery and all
                    proved to be clearly wrong, to the evident amusement of the old gentleman, he
                    resumed his narrative by saying: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>She was makin' a grease lamp. Course I'd seen a many
                            one. She hollered it out and cut a small groove in it on the lip, and
                            after she'd filled it with hog's lard and laid a wick
                            in the notch, and lit it, she handed it to' me, and a butcher
                            knife to Abe, and she says: "Boys, go and get me some
                            bacon." So me and Abe went out to a little pole smoke house and
                            I held up the light while Abe cut a half moon out of a side of Imoon. So
                            Mrs. <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                            </placeName> went on with gittin' supper, and bye and bye she
                            says: "Supper's ready." So when we set down
                            to it we had corn <pb n="325" id="VAA4025-013-4-019"/> cakes, baked
                            potatoes and friend bacon. After the supper disbes was washed up old
                            Tom, a slappln' his hands together and a rubbin' em
                            like I say, he says, says he: "Now, Abe, bring out your book
                            and read fer us." Old Tom couldn't read himself, but
                            he wuz proud that Abe could, and many a time he'd brag about
                            how smart Abe wuz to the folks around about. Well, Abe reached up on a
                            shelf where he kept his books and then a stirrln' up the fire
                            on the hearth with some dry stuff he had piled in one corner by the
                            jamb, he commenced to read.</p>

            <p>When the writer asked as to whether the narrator remembered what book it was that
                    Abe read from, he straightway-replied: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Oh, yes! It wuz the life of Ben Frankliu. He read to us till bed time,
                            and that night Abe and me slept together up in the loft. We got up there
                            through a scuttle hole in one corner of the ceiliu', and to git
                            up to it we had to climb up a peg ladder made by boring holes in the
                            logs and insertin' wooden pins. I remember the bedstid which of
                            course I saw many a time. It wuz a mighty sorry affair; still it
                            answered the purpose. A hole wuz bored in the north wall and a rail-like
                            piece wuz sloped off to fit this. Tbe same thing wuz done on the west

                            way to an upright post out in the floor and then acrost these wuz laid
                            split boards or whipped plank, or some thin slats rived out, and on
                            these wuz a gunny sack filled with leaves gathered from tbe woods. On
                            this Abe and me slept covered with bear skins.</p>

                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> there is, for the most part, comparatively little said concerning
                    the adolescent or formative period in his career. Because of the universal
                    interest in Mr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s life, any contribution bearing upon any phase of his
                    career should be of interest and not wholly without value. Nevertheless, it is
                    true that there has been but meager notice of his youth, since those who have
                    undertaken this <pb n="326" id="VAA4025-013-4-020"/> task possessed but little
                    data, and thus in consequence the conviction inevitably forced itself upon all
                    that there was but little that transpired during Mr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s youth particularly prophetic of the years that followed.
                    In many instances, therefore, the formative period in Mr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s life has been, in consequence of the meagerness of
                    knowledge and reliable data, dismissed as being commonplace. Professing to see
                    nothing exceptional during these formative years, his biographers in many
                    instances have passed on to the days of his early manhood, and sought to call
                    attention to what they regard the real beginnings of his remarkable career. In
                    doing so, in their unwarranted haste to pass to the scenes of his public career,
                    they do not fail to quote the well-known lines of the poet which Mr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> was accustomed to apply to himself: "My life was but the
                    short and simple annals of the poor," as if this would prove a
                    sufficient refutation of any charge of meager notice of the years prior to the
                    day of his appearing on the prairies of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. To put it in another way, the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> admirers have been made to believe that he was a Hoosier prodigal
                    who came to himself about the time, or soon after, reaching the State of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>; and at this time. or subsequent to it, there were certain
                    super-added things affixed to his character that made for honesty, truthfulness,
                    and fixity of purpose.</p>
            <p>The fact of Mr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s honesty, which was so prominent in his later life, is
                    not doubted for a moment, but since substantially all the recorded instances of
                    this trait of his character found their setting in some event in later life,
                    there is a belief that this trait was not particularly noted in his early
                    career, or if so, it was not sufficiently prominent to call forth especial
                    attention; whereas, all of his early associates interviewed by the writer stated
                    that this was quite marked, and so much so as to cause them to remember him by
                    it.</p>
            <p>The writer is convinced, by reason of some years' residence among the
                    early associates of the great war President. that the boy <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> was father of the man. We are indebted to the many biographers of
                    Mr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> for so many things, and to some of these in particular, it would be
                    something approaching sacrilege, for one now at this late day, to even <pb n="327" id="VAA4025-013-4-021"/> appear to take any liberties with any long
                    established beliefs concerning our martyred President. Happily this does not
                    appear to be necessary. But however well meant the efforts were on the part of
                    these numerous historians touching Mr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s early career, unfortunately they have succeeded in
                    focusing the gaze of the world either upon the spot in the State of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> that gave him birth, or upon the prairies of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> where he took his rise to fame, and where his ashes now rest.
                    Tjiose years in his life which he spent in Indiana—from seven to
                    twenty-one—which ordinarily make a period in the life of most men of
                    momentous importance, have been more or less neglected. To undertake at this
                    late day the task of correcting the perspective of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> admirers by focusing the attention upon his youth is an exceedingly
                    difficult one, and ordinarily would prove discouraging, but since it is believed
                    that sufficient data is at hand to substantiate the claim, the task has been
                    undertaken with a view at least of supplementing the work of recognized
                    authorities in this field, as well as rendering tardy justice to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s youth.</p>
            <p>It is to be regretted that some of the earlier biographers of Mr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> did not make a greater effort to collect information touching his
                    youth, since the field was at that time white unto harvest; particularly soon
                    after the death of the President, at which time some two or three biographers
                    came to visit the scenes of Mr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s boyhood and young manhood in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer</region>
                    </placeName> county, Indiana. Some of the more recent writers met with
                    experiences well calculated to discourage further effort in this field, since
                    they possessed erroneous notions of Hoosier manners and customs. In consequence
                    of this handicap some very amusing, not to say ludicrous, things transpired
                    during attempted interviews with certain ones of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s old associates. Many of the historians in speaking of
                    the citizens now residing in the region where Gentryville is located, regarded
                    them as quite below the average; characterizing them as
                    "listless", "poor", "free and
                    easy", "devoid of ambition", and reference has been
                    made to the "antiquated business methods",
                    "dog-fennel streets" and with many other such statements they
                    seem to pay a tribute to the wisdom and foresight of the Lincolns in having the
                    good sense to leave <pb n="328" id="VAA4025-013-4-022"/> that region, since the
                    country and its inhabitants at the present time do not meet with their
                    approbation.</p>
            <p>That there is apparent justification for such a characterization of both the
                    inhabitants of that section today, as well as the region itself, is quite true,
                    and perhaps this would more especially appear so to strangers, although it may
                    be permissible to suggest that these allegations are particularly in bad taste
                    relative to the country itself, since they were made by those who happen to
                    reside in that section of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> where abandoned farms are the rule, whereas there are few abandoned
                    farms in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer</region>
                    </placeName> county, Indiana. Appearances are often woefully deceptive, and it
                    is believed that a better knowledge of Hoosier manners and customs, particularly
                    among the pioneers, would in itself serve a splendid corrective in certain
                    things.</p>
            <p>It may be true that Gentryville and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> City are "dog-fennel towns", yet there are
                    several hundreds like them in Indiana. Gentryville is much the same place that
                    it was during the boyhood of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>. One may still see the Saturday group of loungers seated on dry
                    goods boxes, whittling and chewing favorite brands of tobacco, and
                    "swapping yarns", from which point of vantage they gaze
                    betimes down the little streets to the barren knolls in the distance. The scene
                    is common and to be met with not only in this section of the State of Indiana,
                    but in certain portions of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Such scenes are not particularly inspiring, and are not calculated
                    to impress a visiting stranger with the belief that from such an environment
                    there would come forth any youth who could by any possibility rise to fame; yet,
                    nevertheless, just such places have produced, and may yet be destined to
                    produce, some of our most eminent men. Some two or three incidents and
                    circumstances are here related that occurred within the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> zone, all of them of comparatively recent date and coming under the
                    personal observation of the writer.</p>
            <p>A man with long gray locks, somewhat loose and disheveled, was seated in the
                    witness chair in the circuit court. It was during the month of January, and the
                    weather was cold. He wore a pair of "eastern" boots whose
                    heels had a predilection for rolling over and upward as if in sport of one <pb n="329" id="VAA4025-013-4-023"/> another. His "foxed"
                    trousers were baggy and tattered, and whether the bottoms were too badly worn
                    for service or whether it was merely a habit of the owner, no matter; in any
                    case they were crowded down into the boot tops. A faded brown hand-me-down
                    overcoat, held to its moorings by a bit of binder-twine looped through the torn
                    buttonhole and about the button, served to keep out the cold, this being the
                    only outer garment worn over a shirt not too immaculate. On his knees rested a
                    somewhat dilapidated hickory-straw hat, with the preponderance of evidence in
                    favor of its having done service for at least two summers and certainly until
                    far into mid-winter.</p>
            <p>An attorney (now holding a government position of national importance) from a
                    distance, with evident preconceived notions concerning the old gentleman, was
                    cross-examining the witness.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Witness, can you read and write?"</p>
            <p>"No, sir."</p>
            <p>"You spoke of the payment of taxes" (resting his eyes for a
                    moment upon the boots). "Do you own property?"</p>
            <p>"Well, yes, sir."</p>
            <p>"Now then, just state to the jury what your holdings consist of, whether
                    real estate, etc., etc."</p>
            <p>"Well," began the witness, looking down as if greatly
                    embarrassed, "well, I own a leetle land in this county and some in the
                    county a-jinen."</p>
            <p>"You own a little land, you say, in this and the adjoining
                    county?" (Another glance at the boots, which on taking its leave swept
                    past the straw hat and then fixed itself steadfastly upon the apparently
                    disconcerted face of the witness.)</p>
            <p>"Now, sir, just tell the jury about how much land you own."</p>
            <p>"Well," still looking down, "well, sir, I've
                    got a leetle the rise of three thousand acres here in this county, and some time
                    back I got hold of a leetle jag of money, and not havin' any place jest
                    then to put it, I bought a few hundred acres over in tother county. Besides what
                    leetle land I own, and a few hundred head of cattle, horses and sheep,
                    I've off and on ever now and then been loanin' a leetle money
                    an' ginerally took <pb n="330" id="VAA4025-013-4-024"/> mortgages on
                    land, so I've got plasters you might say, mountin' to nigh on
                    to right about $30,000 or better, and I've Rot
                    government"—</p>
            <p>"That will do, Mr. Witness, that will do."</p>
            <p>The witness here referred to was about the same age as <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> and lived but a few miles from Gentryville. The writer was present
                    on the occasion referred to, and remembers the chagrin and crestfallen air
                    depicted upon the countenance of the imported attorney, and furthermore he
                    recalls the apologetic remarks subsequently made by the attorney, he being more
                    especially induced to do this on learning that the witness was not only a fine
                    type of old fashioned honesty and truthfulness, but was the wealthiest man in
                    the county.</p>
            <p>The old gentleman was not a miser nor yet miserly. He merely continued the habits
                    and customs of the pioneer days. His dress as above described, which is not in
                    the least exaggerated, was subject to a marked change on Sunday; that is to say,
                    the soiled linen was replaced by a garment destined to do duty until the next
                    Sabbath. With slight variation in the matter of dress—on the whole
                    somewhat better—but in all other points essentially the same, the
                    foregoing description would be that of the father of a man born in this region
                    during the Civil war, who today occupies a chair in one of the great
                    universities of our country.</p>
            <p>A case was being tried in the Federal court. A number of witnesses were
                    subpoenaed, among them being an elderly man with a snow-white crescent
                    encircling his chin. His shoes, originally black, were now brown. He wore no
                    such conventional apparel as a collar or necktie, and his clothing otherwise was
                    not at all pretentious. He had spent most of his life in the school room, and
                    was quite generally addressed by all classes of citizens in this <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> country as "Professor," and being well known to
                    the officer of the court he very naturally in calling the witness thus addressed
                    him. An attorney, thinking to make capital out of this circumstance, especially
                    since he noted the character of his dress, began his examination of the witness
                    by requesting to know why he was called "professor."</p>
            <pb n="331" id="VAA4025-013-4-025"/>
            <p>"I do not know, sir, why I am thus so regarded and so addressed, for I
                    make no claim whatever to that honorable title. It is true that I have been a
                    teacher for some time, in fact nearly all my life; but I do not suppose that I
                    am at all entitled to such consideration."</p>
            <p>The attorney, not yet satisfied, pursued the matter further.</p>
            <p>"Well, professor, you are a graduate of course, and can doubtless read
                    Latin." (not at all supposing that the witness was a graduate nor
                    possessing such knowledge as the question implied.)</p>
            <p>"Yes, sir," replied the professor, "Yes, sir, I am a
                    graduate of our State University, and in obedience to your desire to know
                    whether I possess ability sufficient to enable me to read Latin I should say
                    that in addition to my mother tongue I speak French and German rather fluently,
                    Spanish only indifferently well, but I read Hebrew, Latin, Sanscrit and Greek
                    quite well. Indeed, I have even been told by those who have manifested a decided
                    partiality for me that I could have been a linguist had I taken up this study,
                    say at your time of life, but I attribute this great claim of my friends to some
                    little acts of kindness which I have rendered them from time to time through a
                    somewhat lengthened life, rather than to any real excellence that I may
                    possess."</p>
            <p>It was within a half dozen miles of Gentryville that a stranger was impertinent
                    enough to ask an old Hoosier who had an extraordinarily large-sized nose:
                    "How does it happen that you have such a big nose?"</p>
            <p>"I kept it out of other people's business, sir, and let it get
                    its growth."</p>
            <p>As an aid to credulity and at the same time serving in part at least as a fair
                    excuse for the treatment here offered, it may be stated that the writer was born
                    among and reared with later generations of the Lincolns.</p>
            <p>It does not appear to be generally known that all three sons of the elder Abraham <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, grandfather of the President, eventually emigrated to Indiana. The
                    first to come was Josiah, the second son, who settled on Big Blue river, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harrison</settlement>
                    </placeName> county, Indiana. This was in the year 1812. To <pb n="332" id="VAA4025-013-4-026"/> this wilderness home came Thomas <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, father of the President, on a visit, and in part at least his
                    removal from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> to Indiana a little later, in the year 1816, was due to the
                    persuasions of his brother, Josiah. His reasons for leaving <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> are given elsewhere in this narrative, but on deciding to leave <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> he was induced by his brother to try his fortunes in the new State
                    north of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river.</p>
            <p>The writer's forbears came up from the South to this section of Indiana,
                    also settling in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harrison</settlement>
                    </placeName> county, and were neighbors to Josiah <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>. Thus the writer grew to manhood with the descendants of the uncle
                    of the President.</p>
            <p>Later the writer resided for some years in that region where the future President
                    spent his childhood and boyhood, and attained his majority. Here he personally
                    knew a number of Mr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s boyhood and girlhood friends and associates. Repeated
                    interviews were obtained with these pioneers, some of whom up to that time had
                    never so much as been interviewed by a newspaper reporter, much less by any of
                    the biographers of Mr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>. It may be said, however, that this latter statement, apparently
                    incredible, is to some extent accounted for by reason of the fact that these in
                    particular had removed from the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer</region>
                    </placeName> county home to other points in the State, and in one or two
                    instances to other States.</p>
            <p>Some of these boyhood friends of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> here referred to were parishioners of the writer or were members of
                    his congregation, and in a few instances he officiated at their funerals and the
                    funerals of members of their families.</p>
            <p>It is believed that much confirmatory information was obtained from quite a
                    number of the older citizens, who, while being mere children during the
                    residence of the Lincolns in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer</region>
                    </placeName> county, yet being children of the neighbors of the Lincolns and
                    accustomed to hear the fireside discussions concerning the great President,
                    especially after his rise to fame, what they related was in certain instances
                    quite as valuable and trustworthy, and perhaps in an instance or two even more
                    so, than was that offered by some who spoke from personal knowledge.</p>
            <p>With no well-defined purpose of ever making any use of <pb n="333" id="VAA4025-013-4-027"/> the data obtained, beyond personal gratification,
                    having been reared a Democrat in the belief that Douglas was transcend-ently
                    great as compared to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, and having had a gradual political "conversion"
                    my interest in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> grew accordingly. Much time was thus pleasantly spent in
                    interviewing those who either personally knew <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>

                    Indiana, or those who were born about the time of his leaving the State in the
                    year 1830.</p>
            <p>Considerable care has been exercised to distinguish between matter of fact truth
                    and mere tradition. Of this latter there was considerable and occasionally there
                    was an intermingling af fact and tradition. The traditions in every case came
                    but little short of well established facts, and some of these were quite as
                    interesting and suggestive as any statement based upon personal knowledge.</p>
            <p>The mooted question as to the President's maternal ancestry was
                    altogether in favor of the position taken by almost all of his earlier
                    biographers, particularly by Herndon. With no desire whatever of attempting to
                    reopen a discussion that appears to be closed, a statement or two is made. In
                    every case when <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s pioneer neighbors were asked as to the obscure origin of
                    Nancy Hanks, the reply was invariably the same—that she was the
                    daughter of Lucy Hanks, and a Virginian.</p>
            <p>On one occasion after the writer had delivered a lecture on <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> in the region where the President had lived as a boy, and having
                    some of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s old friends in the audience, he was approached by a
                    rather elderly lady who requested an interview on the following day. This was
                    gladly granted. After some questions as to what "the books said
                    concerning the origin of Nancy Hanks," the following statement was
                    made: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I am the daughter of a woman who was about the same age as <placeName>

                            friends, and my grandmother often told me that she was present at the
                            birth of President <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Lincoln</region>

                            many incidents concerning Nancy Hanks and the Lincolns and Abraham in
                            particular. As to Nancy Hanks' origin I've heard my
                            grandmother say again <pb n="334" id="VAA4025-013-4-028"/> and again

                            </placeName>'s mother was a fine lady and wasn't to be
                            blamed for some things; that she was the daughter of Lucy Hanks and some
                            unknown man in <placeName>

                            and no one ever said anything to the contrary.</p>

                    appeared abundantly trustworthy, but was corroborated by the statement of

                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> was asked to submit data for this, which he rather reluctantly did.
                    In a letter to Herndon after <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s death Scripps stated: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>He (Lincoln) communicated some facts to me concerning his ancestry which
                            he did not wish to have published then, and which I have never spoken of

            </p>
            <p>What these facts were we of course do not know, but presumably they must have had
                    to do with this obscurity. Dennis Hanks, a son of Nancy Hanks, aunt of the
                    mother of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, was ever insistent that the mother of President <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> was named Sparrow instead of Hanks. Certain it is <pb n="335" id="VAA4025-013-4-029"/> that both she and Dennis Hanks were for a time in
                    the home of the Sparrows, who, after the marriage of Nancy to Thomas <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> and her removal to Indiana, also removed to that State, taking the
                    irrepressible Dennis with them. It was these Sparrows who occupied the
                    half-faced camp abandoned by the Lincolns, and when seized with milk-sick were
                    removed to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> cabin and both died there. Their deaths took place at the same time
                    as that of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>

            <p>It is passing strange that these pioneers should all be of one mind concerning
                    the obscure origin of Nancy Hanks if there was no foundation for such belief.</p>
            <p>However reliable may be the statements of discoveries made by Mrs. Hitchcock, a
                    descendant of the Hanks family, relative to the origin of the
                    President's mother, there never was, and is not now, just ground for
                    any accusation against these pioneer neighbors of the Lincolns for entertaining
                    and freely expressing the belief, since it was indisputably credited by her
                    illustrious son, and by the elder Hankses and others whose testimony is a matter
                    of record.</p>

                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s youth and young manhood is essential to appreciate some
                    qualities of his mind and peculiarities of belief and practice which appeared
                    when later he was associated with the learned and skillfully trained statesman
                    and politicians, who were for the most part reared under an altogether different
                    environment. The pioneer was more or less given to superstitious beliefs and
                    committed to the trustworthiness of tokens and dreams. While this characterized
                    substantially all classes during the formative period of our country, yet these
                    strange and weird beliefs in particular <pb n="336" id="VAA4025-013-4-030"/>
                    found a congenial abiding place in the minds of the pioneers who came from the
                    South and settled in this wilderness. Indeed, the belief in the efficacy of
                    tokens and dreams, and the faithfulness and almost religious zeal with which
                    signs have been observed have ever characterized the frontier line.</p>
            <p>These strange beliefs inevitably begot still stranger customs. This was
                    especially true of the people in and about Gentryville. If in this section there
                    may yet be found some of those strange beliefs still lingering among those of
                    that earlier period, it need not be regarded as strange, since in other
                    centuries the will of the Almighty was determined by the presence or absence of
                    dew upon a sheep's pelt, and kingdoms were lost or won by the casting
                    of lots. It may well be doubted whether there is not yet clinging to most of us,
                    like barnacles upon a ship's hull, some of the age-long beliefs of our
                    fathers. While we are living with the light beating full upon our faces, yet
                    there is discerned in some an indication that these fireside memories and
                    nursery teachings of that dim and distant past so possess us as to lead to the
                    conclusion that it would not at all be difficult to revert to the practices and
                    beliefs of other years. Bishop Matthew Simpson, one of the greatest forensic
                    orators of his time, and an educator of national prominence, himself a pioneer
                    and a great friend and confidential adviser of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, ever felt a strange and unaccountable pleasure and delight on
                    seeing the new moon over his left shoulder. A certain <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senator from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s boyhood state on more than one occasion in the midst of
                    political campaigns refused to ride in a carriage drawn by black horses.</p>
            <p>Abraham <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> was so indoctrinated with many of these beliefs during his youth
                    that they clung to him until the day of his death. He always believed in the
                    trustworthiness of dreams, one of which in particular was viewed as a good omen,
                    because he dreamed it prior to the victories of Antie-tam, Vicksburg, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the naval battle between the Monitor and the Merrimac, as well as
                    just before the surrender at Appomattox. This dream and others he with a strange
                    simplicity related to cabinets, and doubtless in the very simplicity of his
                    belief failed to realize that these gentlemen <pb n="337" id="VAA4025-013-4-031"/> viewed such as exceptional, if not indicating a decided weakness.</p>
            <p>Advantage is taken of the opportunity here of calling attention to a fact not
                    especially enlarged upon by any, yet which is patent and known to all; that is,
                    we do not take liberties with <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> as we do with many other great men. We laugh with him, but we do
                    not suffer any criticism of him without registering a vigorous protest. This is
                    not even true of <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>To the pioneer in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s day the carrying of an edged tool, such as a hoe or ax,
                    through the house was an omen of bad luck, foretelling a death in the family
                    during the year. The breaking of a mirror was also another sign of death within
                    that period. The plaintive howling of a dog meant that the morrow would tell of
                    a death somewhere. The crossing of the hunter's path by a dog meant bad
                    luck in the chase unless the hunter locked his little fingers until the dog was
                    out of sight; or, what was regarded as better still, if he returned to the point
                    of starting and began his journey anew, all ill fortune occasioned by the bad
                    start would not be reckoned against him. The writer has frequently witnessed
                    these circumstances.</p>
            <p>Friday was a day in the calendar to be avoided in instituting any new departure;
                    that is to say, beginning anything new such as plowing, sowing or reaping in the
                    fields, or the making of a garment, unless the labor could be completetd during
                    the day. A bird alighting on the window or coming into the house was a sure sign
                    of sorrow. All planting, sowing, fencing and preparation for the same was to be
                    governed by certain signs of the moon. Plants, such as potatoes, maturing
                    beneath the surface of the soil must be planted in the dark of the moon. And in
                    like manner tomatoes and beans must be planted in the light of the moon.</p>
            <p>Clapboards on the roofs of buildings would cup and curl if the sign was not
                    right. The fence would settle and sink or creel if there was a failure to
                    consult the almanac for the proper sign. They believed in witches of various
                    sorts, quite as much as they of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> ever did. Although there was no disposition to burn them, they were
                    feared and <pb n="338" id="VAA4025-013-4-032"/> guarded against. They especially
                    believed that some evil-disposed old witch could work evil upon a child.</p>
            <p>The writer has a distinct child's recollection of being caught up from
                    his innocent play into the arms of a frightened lady and hurriedly carried away
                    to a point of supposed safety from a reputed old witch who it was presumed was
                    working her spell over him preparatory to actually bewitching him. It is not
                    believed that this old witch in reality succeeded in her efforts at this time or
                    at any subsequent period, but the writer frankly confesses that while he escaped
                    all of the influences and beliefs so generally prevalent in his youth,
                    nevertheless he finds more satisfaction and contentedness than do some if there
                    is never a hoe or an ax carried through his house. Truly the beliefs of our
                    grandmothers live after them.</p>
            <p>Although there was no physician nearer than thirty miles to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> home, yet this settlement had a "Doctor" of a
                    doubtful sort, one "Cy" (Josiah) <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Crawford</region>
                    </placeName>, for whom <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> and his sister Sarah often labored as "hired man and
                    girl." "Cy," or "Old Blue Nose" <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Crawford</region>
                    </placeName> as <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> later named him, was what was usually spoken of as a "yarb
                    and root" doctor. As a diagnostician he doubtless did not excel, but it
                    was small matter since his prescriptions were few and generally harmless, even
                    if sometimes unpleasant to take. If there was evidence of inflamation,
                    "a counter-irritant was slapped on," and generally "a
                    heroic old fashioned Baptist foot washing," was urged just before the
                    hour of retiring. Blue mass pills were used on the least provocation, although
                    if these were not to be had a substitute was suggested. The writer recalls one
                    instance when "shoemaker's wax" was in an emergency
                    made into plaster and the patient lived to praise his saviour, if not his remedy
                    in his effort to remove the same. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Crawford</region>
                    </placeName>, in lieu of there not being even a traveling dentist, was an
                    extractor of teeth. Heroic methods were used for a time, but his services being
                    so much in demand he obtained a "twister" pair of forceps, and
                    thereafter the surgery was more scientifically performed. A conversation with
                    some who sat under his "prying, twisting and gouging" revealed
                    the fact that laughing gas would have been more than welcomed.</p>
            <pb n="339" id="VAA4025-013-4-033"/>
            <p>Since bleeding was quite generally practiced in that day by reputable physicians, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Crawford</region>
                    </placeName>, always abreast with the times, obtained a lancet and thus added
                    this accomplishment to his practice. Generally speaking, every settlement had a
                    man or woman who could stop bleeding in cases where a vein or artery had been
                    severed, without resorting to the barbarous practice of ligating or cauterizing.
                    This was done by pronouncing certain cabalistic words. The secret of possessing
                    such power was on no account to be conveyed to another unless under proper
                    direction and orderly procedure. A man was forbidden, on penalty of losing his
                    skill, to convey to his brother the secret, but he might with perfect safety
                    admit a woman into the secret, and she in turn could with equal safety initiate
                    a man. At the perilous risk of losing forever whatever cunning and skill the
                    writer may possess in this regard, he dares here to put it to a test by
                    indiscriminately publishing the secret. It will be at once apparent that this
                    conveyance is only possible to ladies. The remedy is simplicity itself, and
                    consists in thrice repeating the sixth verse of the sixteenth chapter of the
                    Prophecy of Ezekiel.</p>
            <p>Faith doctors were implicitly believed in. Long journeys were made to them, their
                    charms invoked and their skill put to a test. In substantially every case these
                    men behaved something after the manner that Captain Naaman supposed the prophet
                    Elisha would have done in his case. They refused to make any charge for services
                    rendered, but if exceedingly provoked by some who were the beneficiaries of
                    their healing powers, they suffered them, on taking their departure, to leave a
                    token of their appreciation as a thank offering.</p>
            <p>There was a commendable reciprocity of neighborliness prevailing among the
                    pioneers. Much of their work was shared in common, particularly such as
                    raisings, huskings and rollings. Associated with these labors by the men, which
                    may not inappropriately be styled field sports, the women of the entire
                    neighborhood assembled to prepare the sumptuous feasts consisting of venison,
                    turkey, pigeon potpie, hominy and corn-dodger.</p>
            <p>Spinning contests were indulged in and the hand-made loom was much in vogue, and
                    if there chanced to be the finishing <pb n="340" id="VAA4025-013-4-034"/> of a
                    blanket or coverlet, or in some instances a quilt, all the young
                    ladies—and some not so young—-would surround this, holding
                    on with both hands, while some one from the crowd of men who were interested
                    onlookers would throw puss, the now thoroughly frightened house cat, into the
                    bagging center. Well might there be manifest interest, for who could tell which
                    way a cat might jump under'such circumstances and thus indicate the
                    next bride?</p>
            <p>Play parties and dancing (hoe-downs) were much in favor, and the mere
                    announcement of a neighbrhood wedding meant an invitation for all to attend who
                    cared to do so. Spelling matches were held every Friday night during the school
                    term, and schoolhouse debates invariably attracted large crowds. Old time school
                    exhibitions, where dialogues were recited and "pieces"
                    declaimed, were frequent. Sometimes these were weeks in preparation and the
                    program so lengthy as to last half the night. Religious services prior to 1820
                    were conducted in private homes, usually by some chance itinerant preacher. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> never saw a church until he was eleven years of age, and he helped
                    in its erection.</p>
            <p>The dress of the pioneer would appear quite as strange to us as some of the
                    modern fashions would have been to him. No woolens were worn in and about
                    Gentryville until the year 1824. Buckskin breeches, sewed with whang, thus
                    making an ornamental fringe, a loose-fitting blouse, and a coonskin cap with the
                    tail hanging down was the usual garb of the men. This was <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s dress during his entire Indiana residence, save that he
                    managed in some manner to get possession of a white shirt a short while before
                    his removal to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In all of these farm and community labors, social gatherings, exhibitions and
                    religious worship <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> was a familiar figure. He particularly enjoyed the schoolhouse
                    debates and exhibitions. The <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>

                        </placeName> Preceptor</hi> furnished the major portion of the declamations,
                    as well as subjects or themes for debate. Some of these latter which were
                    debated by young <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> and others were: <hi rend="i">"Resolved</hi>, That fire is
                    more destructive than water." "Who has the greater right to
                    complain, the negro or the Indian?" Such themes were very gravely
                    discussed not only by the younger generation, but by the older <pb n="341" id="VAA4025-013-4-035"/> men as well. It is said that young <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> in these debates was calm, logical and clear. He, however, often
                    became quite humorous, causing great laughter by his peculiar antics and
                    original remarks, but his aim appeared to be to cause his side to win. At such
                    times two captains stood forth in the presence of the assembled crowd in
                    obedience to the demand of the society and proceeded to "choose
                    up." A stick some three feet in length, often a walking cane, was
                    tossed into the air by one of the captains, the other captain catching it in one
                    hand, and the first in turn grasping it. They placed their hands alternately in
                    position until one became the possessor of the stick. This was repeated three
                    times, the two best out of three deciding first choice of a debater or the side
                    of the argument—depending upon the original agreement. After the
                    house had been divided, the "jury" was selected by the
                    president, usually from three to five members. Sometimes ladies were privileged
                    to sit as judges. It will be seen that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s method in debate was such as to win "the
                    jury."</p>
            <p>One of his old friends, Nathaniel Griggsby, usually called
                    "Natty", although <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> was a great mimic, entertaining and amusing crowds quite as much in
                    this manner as in any other. The humor of any situation or a mirthful and
                    ludicrous turn seemed to criss-cross with smiles his face, which even at that
                    time his associates alleged was "shrivelled and wrinkled". His
                    smiles and laughter spread in humorous confusion over his countenance long
                    before the vehicle of speech had presented the object or subject of his humor to
                    his auditors.</p>
            <p>In his reading he devoured anything and everything that came in his way, never
                    stopping to inquire what it was so long as it furnished his active mind
                    something on which to labor. In like manner the subjects of his mimicry were as
                    varied as occasion might offer, ranging from peculiarities in gait or <pb n="342" id="VAA4025-013-4-036"/> speech of a neighbor or passing stranger to
                    the pulpit efforts of the backwoods, hard-shell Baptist preacher. He was much in
                    the habit of repeating the Sunday sermon to the men and boys in the field on
                    Monday. If perchance he made a rare find, and his Monday audience appeared to
                    appreciate his efforts, he repaired to the Gentryville store at night after the
                    days' labor was done, and there repeated it, embellishing, revising and
                    enlarging as occasion seemed to warrant.</p>
            <p>The Little Pigeon Baptist meeting house was erected in the year 1820. The elder <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> was the boss carpenter, superintending its erection, and, while
                    Abraham was but eleven years of age at this time, it is said that he assisted in
                    felling the trees out of which the building material was obtained. This church
                    was a story and a half high, and, while its proportions were not
                    great,—being twenty-six by thirty feet,—for that period it
                    made a rather pretentious house of worship. It had two windows, each twenty by
                    thirty-six inches, and was heated in extreme weather by means of two
                    old-fashioned fireplaces, there being two mud and stick chimneys, one at either
                    end of the building.</p>
            <p>The church was more or less regularly served by pastors duly called, but there
                    were long intervals when the little congregation was largely dependent upon
                    "local" ministers or some chance ministerial visitor. The
                    regular ministry, while more or less helpful, was in the main but little beyond
                    the major portion of their parishioners intellectually. Since most of them were
                    illiterate, and some of them painfully so and much given to certain pulpit
                    mannerisms, they afforded the critical student of human nature, young <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, a fine field for the free play of his powers of mimicry, and his
                    mirth-provoking efforts at preaching were such as indelibly to fix these in the
                    memory of his boyhood associates many years afterward.</p>

                        <region type="county">Johnson</region>
                    </placeName>, his step-sister, said "he was an indefatigable
                    preacher". It was his usual custom when his father and mother went to
                    church and he and other members of the family remained at home to take down the
                    Bible, read a verse, give out a hymn, and after this had been rendered he
                    proceeded to "preach" a sermon. On one occasion when in the
                        <pb n="343" id="VAA4025-013-4-037"/> midst of a sermon-lecture in the grove
                    near the cabin, John <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson</region>
                    </placeName>, his step-brother, and others who had doubtless heard the Sunday
                    morning sermon out in the fields during the week, came up with a land terrapin
                    which they had picked up in their morning rambles along the creek, and desiring
                    to witness the quick but clumsy movement of the creature, placed a coal of fire
                    on its back. Young <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> remonstrated, but in the midst of the fun occasioned by the frantic

                        <region type="county">Johnson</region>
                    </placeName> picked it up and hurled it against a tree, breaking its shell. As
                    it lay quivering and dying the preacher quickly adapted himself to his audience
                    and began an exhortation on "Cruelty to Animals", saying among
                    other things that "an ant's life is just as sweet to it as our
                    lives are to us."</p>

                    </placeName> was in the habit of delivering the Sunday sermon to his stepmother
                    when for any cause she was not privileged to attend worship. The entire family

                    </placeName>, who would not only repeat the sermon, but the text, and in almost
                    every way reproduce the morning effort, even to the amen. Mrs. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> greatly enjoyed these reports and professed to think that she
                    derived more benefit from Abe's sermonizing than she did from the

                    </placeName> suddenly asked him who was the father of Zebedee's
                    children. The pastor confessed that he did not know. This Zebedee witticism was
                    one of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s earliest attempts, although the first recorded humorous
                    effort was when going to mill and witnessing the slow grinding of the old horse
                    mill, he remarked that "his hound pup could eat all the meal it would
                    grind in a day and then bawl for his supper."</p>
            <p>It was in the pulpit of this Little Pigeon Baptist meeting house, Mr. Herndon
                    states, that young <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> witnessed an amusing incident which befell one of these transient
                    preachers, an incident that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> in later years frequently related, and is as follows:</p>
            <pb n="344" id="VAA4025-013-4-038"/>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>The meeting house was located in the woods a mile and a half from our home
                        and some distance from any other residence. Regular services were held only
                        once each mouth. The preacher on this occasion was an old-line Baptist, and
                        was dressed in coarse linen pantaloons and shin of the same material. The
                        trousers were manufactured after the old fashioned style, with baggy legs
                        and flaps in front, commonly spoken of as "barn doors",
                        which were made to attach to the frame without the aid of susj&gt;enders. A
                        single button held his shirt in position, and that was at the collar. He
                        arose in the imlpit and in a loud voice announced his text: "I am
                        the Christ whom I shall represent today." About this time a little
                        blue lizard ran up underneath his roomy pantaloons, and the old preacher not
                        wishing to interrupt the steady flow of his sermon slapped away on his legs,
                        expecting to arrest the intruder, but his efforts were unavailing and the
                        little fellow kept ascending higher and higher. Continuing the sermon the
                        preacher slyly loosened the button which held the waistband of his
                        pantaloons, and with a kick off came the easy fitting garment. Meanwhile Mr.
                        Lizard had passed the equatorial line and was exploring the part of the
                        preacher's anatomy which lay underneath the back of his shirt.
                        Things by this time were growing interesting, but the sermon kept grinding
                        on. The next movement on the part of the preacher was for the collar button,
                        and with one sweep of his arm off came the tow linen shirt. The congregation
                        sat for an instant as if dazed. At length one old sister in the rear of the
                        room rose up and glancing at the excited object in. the pulpit shouted at
                        the top of her voice: "If you represent Christ, then I am done with
                        the Bible."</p>
                </quote>
            <p>On another occasion a traveling minister happened in the settlement one Sunday
                    morning and was invited to preach. It appears that his pulpit mannerisms,
                    gestures and platform eccentricities; were quite out of the ordinary. He had the
                    habit among other things of rolling his eyes not unlike the old-time colored
                    preacher, and when he warmed up to his theme he pounded the Bible and the hymn
                    book mercilessly, accompanied by certain pauses that might have been eloquent
                    but for the fact that the speaker's zeal got the better of his
                    judgment, for just at this juncture he introduced sundry groans and windy
                    suspirations which no doubt he supposed would greatly aid in fastening the word
                    as a nail in a sure place. In addition to the foregoing the preacher possessed
                    an unfortunate physical defect, perhaps acquired, which was so characteristic of
                    not a few public speakers. He had a mingled sybillant sonorous nazal twang which
                    he pitched into that peculiar key in rendering his sing-song address.</p>
            <p>Lincoln was present on this occasion, as were many others <pb n="345" id="VAA4025-013-4-039"/> of his age, and some of these boyhood friends of
                    Lincoln, among whom was Nat Griggsby, related that young Lincoln again and again
                    repeated this sermon to the farm hands and the group of loungers at the
                    Gentryville store, and so faithful was the presentation not only in words, but
                    in pulpit mannerisms—the rolling of the eyes, pounding of the Bible,
                    and the nazal twang—that it was the judgment of those who heard
                    Lincoln's effort, as well as the original presentation, that it was
                    impossible to tell wherein the one differed from the other.</p>
            <p>It will become at once apparent from some of the foregoing incidents that there
                    never was any justification for the position taken by some of Mr.
                    Lincoln's biographers in assuming, as they did, that he was inclined to
                    make sport of the church or religion as such. The attitude assumed by some of
                    his biographers was not only based upon this habit of Lincoln in repeating the
                    Sunday sermon, but upon some poetic effusions composed "in Bible
                    language", usually after the manner and style of the ancient
                    Chronicles, wherein he caricatured "Sister <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson</region>
                    </placeName> and Brother <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson</region>
                    </placeName>", members of the Little Pigeon church, who had been
                    derelict in duty and in consequence had been called upon to undergo the ordeal
                    of a church trial. After diligent inquiry touching Mr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s religious convictions, nothing whatever was found
                    indicating any tendency toward infidelity or atheism; certainly no semblance of
                    a disposition to criticise or lightly esteem the church or religion. This
                    position of his earlier biographers, who were themselves personally so inclined,
                    is absolutely without any foundation.</p>
            <p>When it is recalled that young <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s habit of mimicry and his subjects and objects of
                    caricature were promiscuous, there is small wonder that these crude efforts in
                    the pulpit were seized upon by him as quite the best for the exercise of his
                    powers, since this field was more inviting than any other that presented itself
                    and he very naturally availed himself of it.</p>
            <p>Being naturally more or less a comedian, and adapting himself to his audiences,
                    he gave way to buffoonery indiscriminately, making selection of anything
                    especially appealing <pb n="346" id="VAA4025-013-4-040"/> to him. He not only
                    mimicked the noisy traveling preacher who was much given to polemic discussion,
                    but was also in the habit of repeating any public address heard, whether on the
                    stump or before the bar. If the address appealed to him as being eloquent or
                    possessing any excellence in any other way, he brought into play his exceptional
                    powers of memory, repeating such portions with evident attempt at seriousness,
                    noting their effect, taking this opportunity to "hear his
                    voice", of which his associates maintained that he was especially vain.
                    Not that his vanity led him to suppose that his voice was musical or fitted for
                    public address beyond others, but his consuming ambition to become a public
                    speaker gave free play to his fancy, and in such boyish efforts he flattered
                    himself into the belief that he was preparing against the day when he could and
                    would take the stump in real earnest.</p>
            <p>He early manifested a desire to indulge himself in public address. If the school
                    exhibitions may be taken into account, his age was about eleven years when he
                    began on his own account. This disposition grew upon him through the years,
                    until by the time he had reached seventeen he was continually "on the
                    stump". His stepmother stated that after a few efforts before boys of
                    his age he at length ventured to try his powers before larger groups. He
                    particularly made choice "of the hands in the fields" until,
                    as she put it, "it soon became an amusing sight to see and hear him
                    make these speeches." She further confessed that her "husband
                    was forced to break it up with a strong hand", since it kept the men
                    from their work.</p>
            <p>There appear to be few such characters as Shakespeare, Burns and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> who, if left to dwell apart and follow the plow or make use of the
                    ax and maul, deprived of the privilege of a university or college, develop those
                    great faculties which nature has so abundantly endowed them with, and happily
                    reach their destined goal by a route, if circuitous and accompanied by exacting
                    and patient toil, is nevertheless apparently best suited to them.</p>
            <p>Perhaps if <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> had been privileged to enjoy the curriculum of a great university,
                    we would doubtless have had a master mind so skilled and trained as to have
                    enabled him <pb n="347" id="VAA4025-013-4-041"/> to occupy a commanding and
                    enviable place in history, but it may well be doubted whether or not the very
                    discipline imposed by such a course of training would not have marred or
                    altogether lost to the world some of those rare qualities of mind and heart
                    which were so prominent in him and which above all else distinguishes him from
                    most great men of his time.</p>
            <p>Since <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> was destined to rise by the sheer force of his own personality and
                    imperious will, and to develop the great qualities of mind in this almost
                    unbelievable manner, it was his good fortune to spend those years of strange
                    preparations among a simple-minded, yet honest and patriotic folk, hedged in by
                    a wilderness but freed thereby from those conventional restraints and hindrances
                    that older and more settled communities usually impose. At the same time he was
                    removed from the blighting effects of vice which, had he been subjected it,
                    might have prevented the maturing of a character, embodying all of the essential
                    basic elements of the plain people. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> did not, as some have supposed, live the cabin life in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> House so much as he lived the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> House life in the cabin.</p>
            <p>Any attempt to analyze his character or in any measure seek to account for the
                    sustained, universal interest in him by substantially all classes of people, as
                    well as youth, and claimed by all political faiths, leads to the fact that in
                    him was embodied all of the essential and vital elements of manhood, as well as
                    the willingness and sincerity of purpose to give executive expression to the
                    wishes of the people. There is discerned in this universal admiration of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> not only an unconscious expression of resentment of such
                    encroachment, but an indication of an instinctive desire to throw off all mere
                    artificialities of life. We recognize that in him dwelt the fullness of the
                    simplicities of life to the extent that he became the apotheosis of the plain
                    people.</p>
            <p>Leonard Sweet, a political friend and associate of the great President, stated
                    that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> in speaking of his Indiana life always spoke of it as the story of
                    a happy childhood. There was nothing sad or pinched about it, and no allusion to
                    want in any part of it. His own description of his youth <pb n="348" id="VAA4025-013-4-042"/> was that of a happy, joyous boyhood. It was told
                    with mirth, illustrated by pointed anecdotes, and often interrupted by his
                    jocund laugh.</p>
            <p>If the Civil war crisis in our national life necessarily demanded a leader who
                    was the embodiment of all that the people themselves stood for or desired, then <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> anticipated this by making choice of a youth without a
                    distinguished name, reared him in the seclusion of the wilderness, just as He
                    has almost all of His great leaders and when he appeared he so far met the high
                    expectations of the Almighty and received the gratitude and applause of mankind

            <p>After the election, interest in Indiana was directed toward the meeting of the
                    next General Assembly. Should the Republicans follow the example set by the
                    Democrats in 1855 by refusing to go into a joint election ? It happened that the
                    State constitution does not lay down definitely the mode of electing a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senator. If the Republican senators should refuse to go into a
                    joint election there was no way of forcing them to do so. Holding this question
                    in mind, a Republican Editorial Convention was convened in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, January 6, 1857. The American editors were invited to meet in the
                    convention but they were asked to come as Republicans.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> At
                    this meeting it was resolved that since the "Old Line" Senate
                    of 1855 had refused to go into the election of a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senator the opposition in the present legislature should refuse to

            <p>The pro-slavery Lecompton convention had framed a constitution which was to be
                    voted on "with slavery" or "without
                    slavery". The constitution was not to be voted on. This produced a
                    split in the Democratic party in Indiana. Some thought that the Lecompton

            <p>In this divided state the Democracy of Indiana realized that it was unfortunate
                    that the Democratic State convention was to be held on January 8, 1858, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, since there did not seem to be much possibility of harmonizing the
                    Douglas and administration Democrats. It was thought that an effort would be
                    made by the followers of Bright and Fitch to force the convention to endorse the
                    Lecompton constitution as a basis for the admission of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> into the Union.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> The opponents of Bright and
                    Fitch urged the party to remember where the doctrine of expediency advocated by
                    the leaders in 1849 had placed the Democratic party and reminded them that it
                    would be foolish to make such a mistake again.</p>
            <p>The convention was a bitter struggle between the Bright men and the Douglas men,
                    in which the Douglas people were unsuccessful. They sustained their first defeat
                    when A. P. Willard was made chairman by defeating W. S. Holman of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName> county. The second defeat came when Joseph W. Chapman of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson</region>
                    </placeName> county moved that parliamentary rules govern the convention. This
                    gave Willard the power to appoint the committees. The nominating committee
                    reported the renomination of the old officers except Superintendent W. C.
                    Larrabee, in whose place Samuel L. Rugg of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Allen</region>
                    </placeName> county was nominated.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> While Senator Bright
                    was addressing the convention the Committee on Resolutions reported a platform
                    endorsing the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

                    </placeName> senators, condemning the Republican State senators for their course
                    in refusing to pass the necessary appropriation bills, and endorsing the
                    administration of James Buchanan. When the Douglas men realized that the
                    platform as reported did not endorse Douglas pandemonium broke loose. Lew
                    Wallace arose, intending to introduce a Douglas resolution, but after fifteen
                    minutes of yelling the meeting was adjourned by Chairman Willard.</p>

            <p>In Indiana the Republicans were divided on the question of the issues for the

                    the next three planks. There were no Temperance nor Know Nothing planks.

                    actual settlers on the public lands. It was the thought of the party that this
                    would be a good means of combatting the further spread of slavery, which
                    depended on large plantations for extension. This plank also appealed to the
                    Germans, who were much interested in getting land for homes. Julian criticized
                    the platform severely by saying that the Republicans not only surrendered the
                    policy of congressional prohibition of slavery in the territories and adopted
                    the principle of popular sovereignity, but made opposition to the Lecompton

            <p>Next to be considered is the attitude of the Republican party toward slavery.
                    Republicans looked upon slavery as a moral, social, and economic evil, an
                    injustice to the slaves, a curse to any community supporting it, and contrary to
                    the dictates of civilization and Christianity. Since there seemed to be no
                    clause of the Federal constitution which gave the national government the right
                    to interfere with slavery in the States, the party did not propose to do
                    anything with it as it existed within the States. But believing that the Federal
                    constitution gave congress the exclusive control of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> territories, the Republicans proposed to prevent the establishment
                    of the institution of slavery in any territories. When ready for Statehood the
                    people of any territory had a right to frame their constitution to suit
                        themselves.<hi rend="sup">77</hi> In answering the attacks of the Democrats
                    that the Republicans had swung over to popular sovereignty, Editor Defrees said
                    that when the Republicans proclaimed popular sovereignty they took no new
                    position and abandoned no former principle, but were standing on a principle
                    that they had asserted "from time immemorial".<hi rend="sup">78</hi> There is no doubt that the Republicans in congress resisted the
                    acceptance of the Lecompton constitution by congress as being contrary to the
                    principle of popular sovereignty. Defrees said: "The Republicans
                    contended then as now that slavery had no right in a territory till the people,
                    through their lawful representatives, established it".<hi rend="sup">79</hi> This does not differ much from Douglas' Freeport doctrine.</p>

                    as there had been in that of 1856. Who would be elected to congress seemed to be
                    of greatest importance to the voters. The determining factor in the Democratic
                    nominations for congress was the attitude of the nominees toward the Lecompton
                    policy of President Buchanan. Every Republican congressman elected in 1856 was

                    was obnoxious to many of the Democratic State politicians, who would probably
                    oppose the selection of Douglas delegates to the Charleston convention.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> It was felt by Democrats that if the will of the people

                    many voters who had gone over to the People's party on the Lecompton

                    the selection of Bright men as delegates to the State convention.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> This fear increased when it became known that Senator Bright was

            <p>The great question in the minds of the voters of the North as the time for
                    holding the national convention drew nearer was, Who can be elected? This was of
                    vital importance to the voters of Indiana, since there was sure to be a
                    strenuous contest in this State. Although the great battles of the campaign were
                    to be fought in the Northern States, a portion of the southern newspapers were
                    demanding that these States should not be granted a vote in the Charleston
                    convention. These editors did not seem to realize that the heaviest fighting
                    would be in the northern States and that a candidate should be chosen who had
                    the best chance of carrying these doubtful States.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Not
                    only was this demand made, but the South demanded that the Democrats leave the
                    principle of nonintervention and adopt the doctrine that the national congress
                    must protect slavery in the territories. The Democratic senators held a caucus
                    at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>, with Senator Bright as chairman, and adopted the Davis resolutions
                    as the creed of the Democratic party.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> It seemed to Indiana
                    Democrats that the administration and the South were desirous of formulating the
                    platform and choosing the candidate for the presidency. This was calling upon
                    the Democrats of the North to acknowledge that the party had stood upon
                    erroneous ground in 1856. There were probably twenty or thirty thousand
                    Democrats in Indiana who would refuse to do so.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>This
                    sentiment was that of the Indiana delegates to the Charleston convention, who
                    voted fifty-seven times solidly for Douglas.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> This did not
                    please Senator Bright, of whom it was reported that he would stump Indiana,
                    county by county, against Douglas, if he should be nominated.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> After the nomination of Douglas and <placeName>

            <p>What should be the attitude of the Republicans of Indiana toward the extension of
                    slavery? Should Indiana support free labor or slave labor? Republicans urged
                    that all who were opposed to the stand of the Democratic party on this question
                    should unite in opposition to it.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> While Republicans agreed
                    that the party should oppose the further extension of slavery they were somewhat
                    divided on the question of congressional or popular sovereignty. Many
                    Republicans did not want the party to declare for either, since the adoption of
                    one of these methods would leave the party with but one mode of doing the work.
                    These men thought that the party should use any legal means for accomplishing
                    its purpose.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> On this question the Shelbyville <hi rend="i">Banner</hi> said, "We favor any legitimate way of excluding

                    said that the State Central Committee did not ask a coalition of political

                    possible, distinctions among the opponents of the so-called Democracy; and that
                    it was the intention of the committee to support any candidate who got a
                    majority of the votes of the convention upon his own merits, but never as a
                    representative of another political party.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> In short, this

            <p>Mr. Solomon Meredith, a former Know Nothing, moved that H. S. Lane be nominated

                    </placeName> nominated 0. P. Morton for lieutenant-governor. Nelson said that
                    this was not the place that Morton's friends wished for him, and not
                    commensurate with his claims or abilities, but it was a place where he could
                    serve the Republicans, and he believed that Morton would accept. Lane and Morton
                    were nominated together for governor and lieutenant-governor. The following was

                            proclaimed in the halls of congress by the Democracy, and disunion
                            purposely openly avowed, we point with pride to the face that not a
                            single Republican, either In congress or the walks of private
                            life—not a single Republican press—not a single
                            Republican orator—not a single Republican convention, has
                            avowed any design against the integrity of the Union, even should the
                            present administration with its corrupt policy be perpetuated by the.
                            vote of the people.</p>
                        <p>2. That we are opposed to the new and dangerous doctrine advocated by the
                            Democratic party, that the Federal constitution carries slavery into the
                            public territories; that we believe slavery cannot exist anywhere in
                            this government unless by positive local law, and that we will oppose
                            its extension Into the territories of the Federal government by all the
                            power known to the constitution of the <placeName>
                                <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                            </placeName>.</p>
                        <p>3. That we are opposed to any interference with slavery where it exists
                            under the sanction of State law; that the soil of every State should be
                            protected from lawless invasion from every quarter, and that the

            <p>It will be noted that the platform did not limit the exclusion of slavery from
                    the territories to the impossible mode of congressional action. It declared that
                    "slavery cannot exist anywhere in this government except by positive
                    local law, and that we will oppose its extension into the territories of the
                    federal government by all the power known to the constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                            <p>should be protected from illegal arrests and searches, as well as
                                from mob violence.</p>
                            <p>4. That the territory of <placeName>

                                </placeName>, now desiring admission under a constitution,
                                republican in form, expressing the will and wish of an overwhelming
                                majority of her people, ought to be admitted as a sovereign member
                                of the Union, speedily and without delay.</p>
                            <p>5. That we are in favor of the immediate passage by Congress of a
                                homestead law, thereby giving out of our public domain homes to the
                                homeless.</p>
                            <p>6. That the fiscal affairs of the State of Indiana have been badly
                                managed. That State officers have been shown to be defaulters to
                                large amounts, and suffered to go unprosecuted. That large amounts
                                of the public moneys have been squandered to enrich officials and
                                partisan favorites, and that when the representatives of the people
                                sought to stop those peculations, by the passage of an
                                "Embezzlement bill," the governor of the State
                                vetoed that bill, and thus kept the doors of the treasury opened to
                                be further robbed by dishonest partisans.</p>
                            <p>7. That it is the duty of every branch of the Federal government to
                                enforce and practice the most rigid <placeName>
                                    <settlement type="city">economy</settlement>
                                </placeName> in conducting our public affairs, and the acts of
                                certain parties in high places, in cheating and defrauding the
                                government out of large and valuable tracts of the public lands, as
                                well as a reckless waste and extravagant expenditure of the public
                                money, by which the National Treasury has become bankrupt, and a
                                borrower in the public markets, by the sale of bonds and treasury
                                notes, meets our earnest condemnation.</p>
                            <p>8. That we consider the slave trade as justly held to be piracy by
                                the law of nations and our own laws, and that it is the duty of all
                                civilized nations, and of our public authorities to put a stop to it
                                in all parts of the world.</p>
                            <p>9. That we are in favor of equal rights to all citizens, at home and

                            <p>10. That we regard the preservation of the American Union as the

                                preserved, and that all who advocate disunion are, and deserve the

                            <p>13. That the soldiers of the war of 1812, who yet remain among us,
                                desurw the grateful remembrance of the people, and that congress
                                should at once recognize their services by placing their names upon

            <p>Lane was chosen for governor as best able to unite all sections and shades of

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. He was considered available since the public was not prejudiced
                    against him as it was against Seward. One strong point in his favor was the fact
                    that he had been a Republican since the beginning of the party.<hi rend="sup">72</hi> There seemed to be no doubt that Indiana Republicans would demand that

            <p>Could Seward be elected if nominated? This was the question which the Republicans
                    of Indiana had to settle. As the time for the convention approached there grew
                    up a strong conviction in Indiana that this State could not be carried by a
                    radical like Seward. This same feeling was shown in <placeName>

                    Neither Seward nor Chase would do since both were looked upon as being
                    "aggressively" hostile to slavery. It was said that there were
                    30,000 men in Indiana, who, if they could vote directly for or against the
                    extension of slavery, would vote against it forever, <list type="footnotes">

            <p>James G. Bryant, member of the State Executive Committee of the Constitutional
                    Union party, wrote that an attempt was being made to throw the Bell vote to the
                    Democrats. He thought that the Constitutional Union party was not organized to
                    aid either the Democrats or the Republicans. It was his own opinion that the
                    Bell men ought to support the Republican State ticket or stay away from the
                    State election and that every Bell man should vote for Bell and Everett in

            <p>Before the day of the October election it was conceded that the majority of the
                    Bell men would vote for the Republican State ticket. Thompson and Edwards were
                    openly against the Democratic party and many other Bell men were for the
                    Republican State ticket, not because they believed in its principles but because
                    of the desire to defeat the Democrats.<hi rend="sup">98</hi>

                    </placeName> Senate, Douglas supported them. This was looked upon as the
                    equivalent of a declaration that Bright and Fitch had been elected by fraud.
                    They never forgave Douglas and were from that time on bitter personal enemies of
                        him.<hi rend="sup">99</hi> In order to insure his defeat in the coming

                    upon with favor by Indiana Democrats since it was felt that its object was to

            <p>Knowing that the Democrats of the State were for Douglas, Bright, Fitch, and
                    James Hughes backed a move for a convention on July 31 to nominate a State
                    ticket. Bright had succeeded in arraying the two factions of the Democratic
                    party in open war against each other.<hi rend="sup">101</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This did not please the Douglas men who claimed that all that Bright was he owed
                    to the Democratic party organization which had had him elected Senator three
                    times by the votes of men who had hated him. Now he was willing to defeat the
                    will of the Democracy of Indiana by putting a new ticket in the field and
                    electing <placeName>

            <p>What did Bright want the Democrats of Indiana to hold as their political
                    doctrine? Breckinridge in his letter of acceptance said that he represented the
                    view that neither congress nor a territorial legislature could establish or
                    prohibit slavery in any territory, but that it was the duty of the federal
                    government and all its departments to secure to every citizen the enjoyment of
                    all his property in any territory of the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>This was in harmony with the view of President Buchanan who, in his message to
                    congress, said, "Neither congress nor a territorial legislature, nor
                    any human power has any authority to annul or impair this vested

                    Senator Fitch, and James Morrison were the most prominent men present. It was
                    decided to put up an electoral ticket but not to nominate a State ticket. A
                    platform was adopted affirming that any citizen had a legal right to take slave
                    property into any territory where it should be protected by congress until
                    statehood was reached. Dr. Sherrod introduced a resolution which provided that
                    the Breckinridge State Central Committee confer with the Douglas State Central
                    Committee with the view of organizing and running a joint electoral ticket which

            <p>Although this resolution was passed it was not taken very seriously by the

            <p>At a meeting of the Breckinridge State Central Committee held September 17, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it was decided that it would be inexpedient to place a national
                    Democratic State ticket in the field.<hi rend="sup">110</hi> This left the
                    Breckinridge men to support whomever they pleased at the State election in
                    October.</p>
            <p>Although the Douglas men had refused to unite with their brethren, the
                    Breckinridge Democrats, in a joint electoral ticket, they courted the American

                    would have been glad to see such a ticket in this State. This was quite a
                    contrast from the position taken by the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> in 1854 and
                    1855 in regard to the Know Nothings. At that time the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi>
                    designated the Know Nothings as infamous, outlaws, murderers, proscriptive, and
                    miserable shams.<hi rend="sup">112</hi> The Breckinridge Democrats declared that
                    they would not vote for the Democratic State ticket believing that political
                    power and patronage would be divided between the Douglas men and "their

                    to form a joint electoral ticket.</p>
            <p>Although the Douglas State Central Committee had refused to consider the joint

                    </placeName> law—the opponents of the Democratic party in Indiana
                    formed the People's party. With the aid of the Know Nothings who
                    generally supported the People's and Republican parties they succeeded
                    in carrying the election of 1854. By 1856 the People's party had gone
                    from the position of demanding the restoration of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Compromise line to the principle of "No more Slave
                    States". During this and the previous campaign the members of the
                    People's party called themselves Republicans, but they did not dare to
                    call their organization by that name. At this time the party was not completely
                    organized, especially in southern Indiana. The defeat in the elections of 1856
                    did not discourage the members of the new party. In 1857 and 1858 they
                    strengthened their party organization and succeeded in 1858 in electing eight
                    congressmen, although losing the State election. By this time the Know Nothings
                    no longer controlled the new party. During this campaign the Lecompton question
                    was the leading issue and the Republicans of Indiana came perilously near to the
                    Popular Sovereignty doctrine of Douglas. In 1860 they went into the canvass with
                    an organization much more complete than before and on the issue of opposition to
                    the further spread of slavery carried Indiana for <placeName>
