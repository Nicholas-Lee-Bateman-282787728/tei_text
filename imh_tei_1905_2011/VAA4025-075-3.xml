                    </placeName> River on the morning of April 29, 1823. As the boat prepared to stop for firewood at
                    the unique town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the Indiana frontier, the villagers were unusually excited. This was the first

                    </placeName>. George Rapp, their leader, and a few others boarded a small boat to view the welcome
                    arrival. Rapp ordered the town cannon fired to mark the occasion. In carrying out his command, the
                    townsmen overloaded the cannon and fired it with a crowd of spectators standing nearby. When the
                    noise of the blast died away, a boy had lost his foot, a man had been knocked to the ground and
                    nearly killed by a wound to the head, and five others had been injured.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    </placeName> or such irresponsible behavior distracted its members from their methodical routine.
                    These German immigrants were known for their solid achievements through discipline, sobriety, and
                    hard work. Their town was a monument to planning, order, and cleanliness. The eight hundred
                    residents were Lutheran dissenters who since 1803 had come to America from the German province of
                    Württemberg. They had built the town of Harmony in <placeName>

                    members, a navigable river for trade, and a mild climate for grape culture. In only nine years they
                    had literally carved <placeName>

                    </placeName> out of the wilderness. Their estate of nearly twenty thousand acres had become a model
                    of communal enterprise that attracted visitors from the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

            <p>Looking ashore on that spring morning in 1823, the steamboat crew could appreciate many of the
                    visitors' tales. Where else on the American frontier could so many people be found living
                    in such material abundance, cultural refinement, and economic security? Long before reaching the
                    town itself, the boatmen could see evidence of the two to three thousand acres that had been fenced
                    and brought under cultivation. Large fields were planted with wheat, corn, oats, sugarcane, cotton,
                    tobacco, flax, hemp, rye, and barley. Acre upon acre surrounding the village was green with
                    vineyards and apple, peach, and pear orchards. Cattle, horses, and prized merino sheep grazed on the
                    hillsides. As their boat reached the landing at the north end of <placeName>

                    </placeName> was a prosperous and almost completely self-sufficient, communally owned city of some
                    180 buildings. Factories, mills, and granaries combined with the produce of the fields and forests
                    to provide the necessities of life. Through a post office, bank, store, and tavern, commerce was
                    carried on. A school, library, church, and community house and public gardens fostered education,
                    culture, and religion. Each family lived comfortably in a log, frame, or two-story brick house on a
                    fenced lot with its own garden and cow. Single adults had rooms in one of four dormitories occupied
                    by both sexes. No community had greater solidarity or a clearer vision of its Utopian future.
                    Rapp's followers were convinced that they were a chosen people, divinely appointed to help
                    establish the Kingdom of God on earth after the imminent Second Coming of Christ. As such, they had
                    united in imitation of first-century Christian communism to found their Harmony Society in 1805.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                    political tensions, he grew to manhood, having learned vine dressing from his father and having
                    become a weaver by trade but feeling all the while an irresistable desire to preach. Disillusioned
                    with the cold formality of the state Evangelical (Lutheran) church and attracted to the emotional
                    appeal of pietism, he separated from the church in 1785. The magnetism of his personality and the
                    potency of his ideas had already made him the leader of other religious dissenters who were meeting
                    illegally in his house. The nucleus from which the Harmony Society would spring had formed.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                    threat to civil government. An unsuccessful attempt to silence Rapp and to crush his movement
                    ensued. Rapp refused all suggestions that he stop preaching, asserting to the officials at
                    Maulbronn, "I am a prophet and am called to be one." When he was imprisoned
                    briefly, his popularity increased. Upwards of twenty thousand people eventually considered him their
                    prophet.</p>
            <p>Rapp's doctrines held a strong appeal for the common German people during a difficult time
                    in their history. His ideas were straightforward, strong in emotional content, and most compelling
                    once firmly believed. Basically, they emphasized the beliefs and practices of the early Christians
                    as Rapp understood them. Heartfelt conversion from sin and daily, personal communion with God were
                    his cardinal pietistic principles. Constant pursuit of Christian perfection prepared the righteous
                    for the second appearance of Christ and the work of setting up the new social order that would
                    accompany the Kingdom of God on earth. Biblical prophecy provided the most important element for
                    cementing Rapp's followers as a group. It gave them the sense of being a select few with a
                    divine mission. They increasingly saw themselves as the Chosen People of God described as the Church
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Sunwoman in chapters 3 and 12 of the Book of Revelation. As the modern
                    embodiment of the ancient Church of Brotherly Love, the Rappites considered themselves
                    God's most faithful and favored congregation (Rev. 3:8–12). Later, they viewed
                    their communal society in America as an example for all Christendom, its members reaching toward
                    holiness, bearing up under every burden, and reaping the promises of eternal reward mentioned in St.
                    John's vision.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>As Rapp's utterances became ever more unorthodox, the Württemberg government
                    demanded that he submit a written statement of faith in 1798. From this time and this statement the
                    Harmony Society can be said to have taken shape. The statement indicated that the Rappites opposed
                    infant baptism, confirmation, oaths, and military service. Although they respected the place of
                    government in human affairs, they upheld the right of like-minded people to form separate
                    congregations and to establish schools to promote their doctrines. They also asserted that only the
                    righteous should be permitted to take holy communion.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>Such open rebellion against religious and civil authority could not go uncensored in Lutheran
                    Württemberg. Rapp was summoned to Maulbronn again for questioning in 1803 and commanded
                    not to speak outside Iptingen. It was then that he decided that the time had come to seek a haven
                    for himself and those faithful to his teachings beyond the reach of an established church. America
                    beckoned prophetically, as it had to so many earlier Europeans, as the pristine land of millennial
                    promise, and Rapp willingly yielded. Accompanied only by his son, John; Dr. John Christopher
                    Mueller; and Dr. P. Friedrich Conrad Haller, who soon forsook him, Rapp arrived in <placeName>

                    separatists as soon as he could locate lands for their settlement. In reality, although many German
                    pietists immigrated in the early nineteenth century and some founded their own communal societies as

                    interest in Rapp's project and his high ideals but explained that only Congress could grant
                    such a favor. Later, in 1806, the <placeName>

                    if the immigrants were to survive as a group complete economic sharing and central administration of
                    available funds were essential. There could be no rich and poor, only brothers and sisters sharing a
                    common purse as the early Christians had done. Like all other Christian communitarians before and
                    since, the Rappites cited verses from the Acts of the Apostles as justification for their communism:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>And all that believed were together, and had all things common; And sold their possessions
                            and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need (Acts 2:44, 45). And the
                            multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them
                            that ought of the things which he possessed were his own; but they had all things common.
                            … Neither was there any among them that lacked; for as many as were possessors of
                            lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, And laid
                            them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according
                            as he had need (Acts 4:32, 34, 35).</p>

            <p>Rapp had become convinced of the feasibility of communal living partly by reading the 1741 German
                    edition of Johann Valentin Andreae's <hi rend="i">Christianopolls.</hi> First printed in
                    Latin in 1619, this novel by the well-known seventeenth-century Württemburg social
                    reformer and clergyman described the workings of an imaginary communal Christian republic in great
                    detail. Rapp applied the ideas of Andreae to his Harmony Society and eventually taught that God had
                    intended all mankind to live communally. Adam's sin, he suggested, had substituted
                    self-seeking and private property for the pure communism of God's plan. Only in the
                    harmonious world created by the saints upon Christ's return would this perfect condition be
                    universally revived. It was Rapp's intention that the communism of the Harmony Society be a

                    original Articles of Agreement after a six- to eight-week trial period. In 1818 the community
                    decided to destroy the record telling what each person had donated to the Society and to repeal the
                    section of the articles that guaranteed a parting cash gift. This enhanced the equality of all
                    within the communistic brotherhood, cancelled any hopes the rising generation may have had of
                    gaining family inheritances, and insured against the nagging problem of demands for exorbitant

                    servants who had come to America after 1816 partly on Rapp's encouragement but without
                    sufficient funds for passage, and a few former slaves whose freedom the Society had purchased in
                    return for a set time of indentured service. By 1821 Rapp was persuaded that many of the recent
                    German immigrants who became members were ill prepared by commitment of faith or communal
                    orientation to add to the stability and progress of the Society. Therefore, he decided to protect
                    the community from any further mass inductions by forbidding members to write any more letters of
                    enticement to German friends and by drawing up a new, more explicit, individual contract for future
                    members. This contract included the basics of the 1805 Articles but had to be more formally signed
                    by the new member and countersigned by "George Rapp and Society" in the presence

                    Scripture and world events as they might apply to the coming millennium. He gave literal meaning to
                    Jesus' words, <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that
                            where I am, there ye may be also (John 14:3). Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting
                            on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven (Mark 14:62). Blessed are
                            those servants, whom the Lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you,
                            that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve

                    "of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father
                    only" (Matt. 24:36), he felt strongly that the Napoleonic wars signalled mystically that

                        <p>When Christ announced His coming Kingdom of God and preached it, all nations which wished the

            <p>At the insistence of Father Rapp the community later began to collect a "church
                    fund" in specie that was intended to shield the Society against the monetary uncertainties
                    preceding Christ's return. Along with freshly kept flour for bread making, this fund was to
                    be available on a moment's notice for Rapp's historic pilgrimage to Jerusalem
                    where he would introduce his righteous band to the triumphant Savior. Under the exclusive, even
                    secret, control of the Harmonist patriarch, the church fund grew to a half million dollars in gold

                    millennial teachings of the charismatic Father Rapp, the importance of the Society and its frontier
                    town rested on their rapid rise to economic and political prominence in the development of Indiana
                    and the American West. Under the astute leadership of the elder Rapp and his adopted son, Frederick
                    (Reichert) Rapp, the little German village quickly had become an oasis of trade on a frontier of
                    thinly scattered English and French settlers. The absence of nearby competitive towns worked in

                    </placeName>, the Rappite institution fared better than most. Frederick Rapp served as its president
                    and personally signed all notes along with cashier John L. Baker, who had Anglicized his name from
                    Langenbacher for business purposes. In 1817 Frederick and five non-Harmonists were authorized by the
                    Indiana legislature to establish branches of the <placeName>

                    bankruptcy into which it had fallen, Frederick was named to the new board of directors. However, he
                    and the others found this bank beyond redemption from the entanglement of its own mismanagement, and
                    it was closed by court order the following year.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

            <p>Failing banks, unstable currency, and severe depression helped convince the Rappite leaders that the
                    West was a poor center for business operations. But these same tenuous circumstances made other
                    frontiersmen notice the exceptional economic strength of communal <placeName>

                    were refused. When Indiana's first governor, Jonathan Jennings, asked for $1,000
                    at 10 percent interest for his personal use, he was turned down. When the Indiana state treasurer
                    asked the Rappites for $5,000 to shore up the state itself in 1823, however, the German
                    communalists acknowledged their obligation to keep the state government solvent by granting the
                    funds at the standard 6 percent interest. <placeName>

                    occasional rotation of jobs to avoid boredom, and the making of every task a friendly, cooperative
                    endeavor. The Rappite men possessed skills in every trade needed to build and operate a
                    nineteenth-century town. They were organized into companies under master tradesmen. The men of the

                    George was forced to deal with most Americans through an interpreter because he spoke very little
                    English. Therefore, in 1805, when he adopted his faithful aide, he also made him business manager
                    for the Society. Frederick then created the efficient system by which the community's
                    activities were divided into seven departments, each with a manager appointed by Frederick and

                    beautify the work areas. The elder Rapp's fondness for flowers and shrubs also was evident
                    in the life of the community. Near the south edge of town he had a hedge labyrinth planted so that

            <p>The political voice of the eight hundred German communalists was expressed mostly through Frederick
                    Rapp during the formative years of the state of Indiana. Fear that the Harmonists would dominate

                    commitments prevailed among the other citizens of Posey and Gibson counties. For this reason Baker

                    But once the resolution passed, he worked vigorously to make the proposed fundamental law reflect
                    the ideals of his constituency. While Frederick served on the committees that dealt with the
                    executive branch of government and the militia, his father assured him by letter that "the
                    invisible power of the Lord will not desert you in your effectiveness of reasoning wisely, also you
                    have your good protective angels who support your politics which allows your sensitive premonition

                    saw it as a God-given sanctuary in which to pursue Christian perfection and a well-rounded life
                    while awaiting the climax of human history in Christ's second advent. Conveniently removed
                    from the political and economic struggles beyond their community, the great majority of Rappites
                    enjoyed the tranquil security of an ethnically homogeneous communal society. Isolated from other
                    frontiersmen by language, culture, and religion, they went about their daily routine in a world
                    apart. Beyond their assigned labor they found opportunities for personal enrichment and expression.
                    All were encouraged to read, write, sing, and participate in religious services and discussions. By
                    1825 the <placeName>

                    </placeName> was the only one ever written by George Rapp and the first on philosophy printed in
                    Indiana. The Rappite leader titled it <hi rend="i">Gedanken über die Bestimung des
                        Menschen, besonders in Hinsicht der gegenwärtigen Zeit</hi> and had it translated
                    immediately into English as <hi rend="i">Thoughts on the Destiny of Man, Particularly with Reference
                        to the Present Times.</hi> Both versions appeared within months of each other in 1824 and 1825.
                    This book contained the core of Rapp's religious and social theories. In it he identified
                    "Harmonie" as the essence of God's earthly kingdom that could only be
                    attained by an unreserved pursuit of Christian perfection. In order to give his ideas the broadest
                    credibility, the Harmonist preacher made every effort to have his "Harmonie"
                    correspond to the description of the ideal "Humanitat" to which, according to the
                    systematic arguments and popular books of the contemporary German philosopher and theologian Johann
                    Herder, all human history was inevitably evolving. To make sure that there would be no discrepencies
                    between the two Utopias, Rapp copied some sections of Herder's works into his own book

                    was modeled after the educational ideas of Luther and Andreae. Rapp and his followers had attended
                    the vernacular free schools of Württemberg that were set up on Luther's plan in
                    the sixteenth century. These schools stressed the teaching of reading, writing, religion,
                    arithmetic, and music to produce a literate, Bible-reading citizenry for the benefit of church and
                        state.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> The pedagogical methods employed in Andreae's idyllic
                    Christianopolis appealed to the Rappite leader because of their communal and Utopian implications.
                    Andreae gave top priority to the schooling of the youth of Christianopolis. He called for a
                    meticulous selection of teachers, free coeducational state schools for children from ages six to
                    fourteen, a wide-ranging curriculum, instruction in useful trades, and the use of laboratories,
                    libraries, museums, and presses as teaching devices.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>

                    at Economy. Mueller and Eckensperger encouraged excellence by selecting the best exercises each week

            <p>The accomplishments of a few students demonstrate the effectiveness of the daily school in going
                    beyond religious indoctrination and the "three Rs" to stimulate individual and
                    cultural interests. Wallrath Weingartner joined the Society with his parents in 1805 at age ten,
                    attended the school at Harmony, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, and became the most outstanding artist among the Rappites. With the other students he
                    learned to sketch flowers and birds in two dimensions with ink outline and wash colors, which was
                    the only Harmonist medium.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> Although no Rappite was permitted to make art more
                    than an avocation, Weingartner did many paintings of single subjects and completed a full-color
                    sketchbook in 1829 entitled "Ornithology or the Natural History of the Birds of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    which was in the Harmony Society library. Weingartner's masterpiece proved him not only a
                    flawless copyist but also an artist with keen sensitivity for selecting the finest available

                    engage in a broad range of activities. She sang soprano in a girls' quartet; played the
                    pianoforte in the orchestra; and, together with Rapp's daughter, Rosina, studied English at

                    Although his growing authority and prestige inside and outside the community eventually aroused the
                    jealousy of the aging George Rapp, it was Romelius who succeeded the venerable leader as president
                    of the Society when Rapp died in 1847. Baker gave responsible direction to the declining numbers of

                    congregational singing, small group performances, and the copying and composition of hymns that
                    culminated in the publication of <hi rend="i">A Small Collection of Harmonist Songs</hi> in 1824.
                    Three of the Society's favorite songs were "Durch Zerfallne Kirchen

                    Führe Mich " ("Lord Lead Me") by Mueller. The six annual
                    festivals of the Society were the most important occasions for singing the anthem-like compositions
                    called "odes." In addition to the traditional Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost
                    observances, festival days included <hi rend="i">Harmoniefest</hi> on February 15, to commemorate

                    fields. Unlike most women in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> at that time, they were assured of schooling and vocational training for their children
                    of both sexes and lifelong learning opportunities for themselves. Books, newspapers, instrumental
                    and choral music instruction and performances, religious services, discussion sessions, and evening
                    classes in English and arithmetic were available for their intellectual and social stimulation.<hi rend="sup">74</hi>

            <p>Harmonist women had entered as freely as their husbands into the consensus on celibacy during the
                    religious fervor of the religious revival in 1807. At the urging of their patriarchal leader they
                    had come to believe that sexual activity had no more place than private property in
                    Christ's coming kingdom. Christine Rapp, George's wife, had set the example by
                    agreeing with her husband to suspend sexual relations before they emigrated from <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">75</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Justification for the departure from customary marital relations was drawn from the writings of
                    seventeenth-century German mystic Jakob Boehme, from Father Rapp's own concept of universal
                    harmony, and from selected biblical passages. From Boehme came the idea that man, created in
                    God's image, had had no physical sex organs before he sinned in the Garden of Eden and that
                    he would be restored to that pure, God-like condition after Christ's return. The
                    Harmonists' self-imposed celibacy was, therefore, an imitation of that perfect state that
                    very soon was to be a reality once again. Father Rapp stressed chastity as an important step toward
                    the universal harmony that had been lost in Adam's fall, which had not only separated human
                    beings into male and female but had also effected their alienation from the Creator. The sacred task
                    of the Harmony Society, as Rapp intended its name to imply, was the restoration of this lost cosmic
                    harmony in anticipation of the millennium. <list type="footnotes">

                        purification.<hi rend="sup">76</hi> Biblical passages that had led other communal groups to
                    abandon sex helped convince the Harmonists also. Jesus, who himself never married, proclaimed that
                    "there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's
                    sake" (Matt. 19:12). <placeName>

                    better to remain unmarried (I Cor. 7:27). The Book of Revelation (14:14) indicated that the 144,000
                    saints redeemed from the earth "are they which were not defiled with women; for they are
                    virgins."</p>
            <p>Outsiders often misunderstood the reasons for Harmonist celibacy and overemphasized it as the central
                    concern of Rappite life. Lord Byron in Canto XV of <hi rend="i">Don Juan</hi> tried to tie Rappite
                    sexual restraint to a Malthusian desire to limit population growth.</p>

                    indentured servants, Frederick unwittingly prophesied the schism that later rent the Rappite
                    membership when he added that "every reasonable person and one who knows human nature would
                    easily see that a society of about 800 people could not live under a law of that kind and live in
                    peace and unity for so many years." His explanation of this Utopian situation was that
                    "the Harmony Society consists only of people who live the religion of Jesus practically and
                    who pursue sanctification. Among these there are some of both sexes who have so advanced in
                    sanctification and who by means of the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ and His vicarious
                    atonement have been so ennobled in their virtue, that they of their own free will have given up
                    carnal intercourse and devote themselves fully to prepare for Christ and His Kingdom, which kind of
                    people have always existed and still exist, although their number has always been

            <p>If not universally adhered to over a long period of time, celibacy nevertheless was a unifying factor
                    in the Harmonist community immediately after its adoption. Only under peer pressure and Father

            <p>Before this fate could overtake his Utopian dream, however, George Rapp and his associates weathered

                    from Württemberg, and grape culture and river trade were to flourish. Father Rapp told
                    his disciples that the move to the remote Indiana frontier would fulfill the passage in which the
                    Sunwoman was "given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness,
                    into her place where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the place of the
                    serpent" (Rev. 12:14). After becoming established in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the trusted leader announced that his Society as the Sunwoman would reach the zenith
                    of her power after 1822 during the Era of the Golden Rose of Micah 4:8, and he directed that a rose
                    be carved in the stone lintel above the door of the large cruciform church built in that year.<hi rend="sup">82</hi>

            <p>However, the reasons for escaping into the wilderness and the early promise of the frontier location

                            only forty-eight votes to Harrison, contested the election results on the grounds that some
                            of the Rappite men who voted had not yet been naturalized as citizens. Although this claim
                            may have been correct, the Indiana Senate Committee on Elections confirmed the seating of

            <p>Economic advantage and religious utopianism, however, were apparently uppermost in the minds of the
                    Rappite leaders. The location they chose for their last and most elaborate town was situated ideally
                    for manufacturing and commerce a few miles down the <placeName>

                    </placeName> at present-day Ambridge. By calling their new settlement Economy, they indicated the
                    basic direction of their thought. The name also fit well with George Rapp's latest vision
                    of the "divine Economy" which he discussed in his <hi rend="i">Thoughts on the
                        Destiny of Man</hi>, written during the weeks of reflection and relative inactivity just before

                    plenty to be brought about by the communal endeavors of Christians united in brotherly love. Rapp
                    maintained that his Harmony Society already had become the practical demonstration of the
                    feasibility of this revolutionary development. In his words it was a "Noble Assylum! where
                    brethren live together in unity and love, &amp; form upon Earth, a Kingdom of God."
                    Therefore, at Economy, <placeName>

            <p>The village of Economy fulfilled much of the economic promise of Rapp's vision but fell far
                    short of the unity and love that were to bring about the Kingdom of God on earth. Ironically,
                    Economy became the arena in which the Society's latent personality conflicts, power
                    struggles, and millennial frustrations as well as Father Rapp's improprieties and errors in
                    judgment surfaced and took their divisive toll. The Hildegard affair and the Count de Leon schism
                    produced the turning points in the history of the community.</p>
            <p>The aging, celibate Father Rapp permitted himself to become enamored with the beautiful, talented,
                    and potentially seductive Hildegard Mutschler, who was born in the Harmony Society in 1806. She
                    became his companion, confidante, and laboratory assistant in the late 1820s to the scandal of the
                    other members and the disgust of Frederick. When she fell in love with Jacob Klein, the jealous
                    Father Rapp unjustly cast him out of the fold, and a few other members withdrew in protest.

                    away from Economy with a young Society business agent, Conrad Feucht, in June, 1829. Instead of
                    accepting her departure and recovering his self-control and the dignity of his office, Rapp
                    discredited himself by publicly condemning his most faithful followers for prejudice against her and
                    demanding that they pray for her return.</p>
            <p>The Hildegard episode spread disillusion among the congregation, caused a few secessions, and broke
                    the filial bond between Frederick and his father. In a deeply emotional, impeccably argued letter
                    written at midnight on September 2, 1829, Frederick recounted the facts of the Hildegard affair for
                    his father: the unreasonable conduct of the Harmonist leader, the great internal damage done to the
                    membership, and the blight upon the community's reputation at large.<hi rend="sup">96</hi>
                    Frederick had lost confidence in George Rapp. He could no longer be his alter ego.
                    Frederick's early death at age fifty-nine in 1834 following the de Leon schism robbed the
                    Harmony Society of one of its most faithful servants and was undoubtedly a product of these tragic
                        events.<hi rend="sup">97</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Hildegard affair Father Rapp tried to recover the community's respect for his
                    leadership. He worked feverishly but unsuccessfully in his laboratory to reaffirm his divine
                    sanction by transforming base metal into gold. In the meantime a challenger arrived at Economy.
                    Bernhard Mueller was a brash recent German immigrant who easily gained a following among
                    Rapp's pietists by claiming to possess the philosopher's stone by which he alone
                    could produce precious metal and by asserting to be the Count de Leon (the Lion of Judah) with
                    divine right to supplant Rapp's millennial leadership. The competition that ensued between
                    Rapp and Mueller made a mockery of their doctrines and a travesty of the name and purpose of the
                    Harmony Society. In 1832 one third of the Society's members, about 175 in all, including
                    the indispensable Christopher Mueller, left to follow the count's pseudoscience and
                    flamboyant millennialism. Under the circumstances George and Frederick Rapp made a generous
                    settlement of $105,000 with the departing members who organized the New <placeName>

                    Society began an irreversible decline although its material wealth increased phenomenally. Father
                    Rapp and his loyalists held ever more tenuously to their fading millennial hope. The
                    community's dismay that their mentor could not make good his consistent promise to deliver
                    it into Christ's presence was best said by the eighty-nine year old Rapp himself in his
                    dying hour. "If I did not so fully believe that the Lord has designed me to place our
                    society before his presence in the land of Canaan, I would consider this my last."<hi rend="sup">99</hi> Two decades after Rapp's death, which occurred on August 7, 1847,

                    emphasis from communal agriculture, manufacturing, and commerce to capitalistic investment in oil
                    wells, pipelines, and railroads; and had begun to multiply their Society's wealth into the

                    across an ocean and sustained them for a century. Their Harmony Society became prominent in the
                    American communal tradition. They contacted and influenced many of the other communal groups of the
                    nineteenth century. Although George Rapp established but one communitarian society, he believed that
                    small, voluntary associations of Christians working industriously under strong leaders would
                    constitute the perfect world order of the future. Therefore, it was natural for his Society to
                    emulate the Ephratans; to interact with the Shakers, Zoarites, Mormons, Keilites, Icarians, and
                    Hutterites; to provide a communistic model and a ready-made town for the Owenites; and to help to

            <p>The Harmony Society became one of the finest examples of the nine separate German-speaking communal
                    groups which composed the largest distinctly ethnic element in this country's Utopian
                    history, from the Woman in the Wilderness in 1694 to the Hutterite colonies of today. The Harmonists
                    may have been more commercially aggressive, systematic in town planning, and, except for the
                    Ephratans and the men of the Woman in the Wilderness, more intensely millennialistic and culturally
                    active than the others. But their charismatic leadership, pietistic orientation, community of
                    property, autocratic yet curiously democratic government, agricultural and manufacturing
                    enterprises, divisive struggles for power, long life, and, with the exception of the Hutterites,
                    eventual demise characterized all of the German-American communal societies.</p>

                    gardens, cemeteries, tools, and handicarfts can be seen as enduring features of this German
                    heritage. Original Harmonist half-log structures built of standardized, precut timbers marked by
                    Roman numerals like those of Württemberg and utilizing pugging (boards daubed with mud
                    and wrapped with straw for insulation and fire-proofing) have been preserved and restored.<hi rend="sup">102</hi> The importance of each Harmonist town has been recognized by its inclusion
                    in the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
            <p>The Harmonist story reveals much about the early American republic. It shows the difficulty involved
                    in obtaining land grants from the federal government. It demonstrates the solidarity and economic
                    potential of corporate bodies conducting business in a free enterprise system. Like the developing
                    national economy, that of the Harmony Society moved from agriculture to manufacturing and the
                    beginnings of investment capitalism in oil and railroading. The Harmonist experience illustrates the

            <p>George Rapp could look back with great satisfaction on all these accomplishments on the afternoon of
                    May 24, 1824, as he sailed away to continue his Utopian adventure with the first contingent of the
                    seven hundred Harmonists moving to Economy. George Schaal, one of the faithful on the boat with him,
                    had written their benediction on the staircase in Dormitory Number 2: "On the twenty-fourth
                    of May, 1824, we have departed. Lord, with Thy great help and goodness, in body and soul protect
                    us." With one last salute from the town cannon that had been used so carelessly the year
                    before to celebrate the arrival of the first steamboat, Father Rapp and his party moved slowly out

                            knows how to give a special emphasis to that which he says. He speaks a Swabian dialect,

                    of the War of 1812. Staunton and his son Pheneas accompanied Rapp back to Economy and purchased
                    Holland sheep for themselves. Pheneas painted Rapp's picture en route. The
                    general's granddaughter, Emily A. Peck, sold it to the Society in 1894. In the <hi rend="i">Harmonie Herald</hi>, April, 1970, however, Daniel B Reibel states that the portrait was done

            <p>The development of house construction in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> reflects the limitations of building equipment, materials, and manpower. Two distinct
                    phases are evident in the building and growth of the town. Generally speaking, between 1814 and
                    1819, most of the structures were of log. They were built principally with squared timbers but
                    sometimes of round unhewn logs, mainly poplar or oak. The corners were cut and shaped to interlock
                    with reverse angles, thus preventing their pulling apart. The space between the logs was chinked
                    with small wood shims and a clay grouting mixed with straw and river shells. Roofs were framed with
                    rafters and mortised and tenoned at the peak. Walls were erected initially with no openings. Windows
                    were cut when glass and sash became available. Some chimneys were built for fireplaces; however,
                    most were constructed for stoves that were used for heating and food preparation, though not baking,
                    as there were community bake ovens on each block. To control vermin, interiors of the later log
                    houses were whitewashed and floors scrubbed with sand, lye, and hot water.</p>
            <p>The early dwellings were placed back from the street, leaving room for more permanent construction
                    later. The advent of a sawmill and brick kiln made this possible. Between 1819 and 1824, when phase
                    two of the building development took place, houses were either of frame or brick, dimensions of the
                    latter typically 22′6″ by 30′6″ and the former
                    20′3″ by 28′3″. Framing elements were numbered with
                    Roman numerals (a device frequently used in German construction), allowing for quick and accurate
                    assembling.</p>
            <p>Though there were minor variations in all buildings, these houses had certain common characteristics.
                    They had six rooms: a stair hall, kitchen, and common room on the first floor; a stair hall and two
                    bedrooms on the second. All rooms were entered from the halls and none interconnected. There was a
                    single entrance from a side yard rather than from the street. Each house had ten windows placed high
                    to insure privacy and two small gable windows at each end of the attic. Interior walls were
                    plastered and trimmed with simple beaded boards, as were the clapboard exteriors.</p>
            <p>Each house had a barn which accommodated equipment and a cow and incorporated the outhouse.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>The Harmonists used the pugging method to provide insulation and fire-proofing in construction.
                    So-called "Dutch biscuits" were made by wrapping tapered slats of wood with straw
                    and mud and then inserting them between the floor joists and wall studs which contained grooves.
                    Generally the "biscuits" measured about eighteen inches long and seven inches
                    wide. They effectively kept the winter heat in, the summer heat out, and sound in its proper place.

            <p>George Rapp's house was built several years (ca. 1817-1818) after the arrival of the
                    Harmonists. Whenever mentioned by visitors, the house was described as a large handsome building and
                    was compared in size to No. 2 Community House (after 1821) across the way. Elias Pym Fordham in his
                        <hi rend="i">Personal Narrative of Travels …, 1817–1818</hi> called it
                    "by far the best in Indiana." In an inventory of buildings and real estate dated
                    January 16, 1819, "Mr. Rapp's brick house" is valued at

                    Owen in an article, "Regarding Human Foot-prints in Solid Limestone." In
                    explaining the rock's geological history, Owen astutely observed: "It appears to
                    me much less improbable that some aboriginal artist should have exhibited unlocked for skill in

                    other; and Mr. Rapp sits while he preaches in a chair placed on a stage, about one yard high, with a
                    table before him. When I heard him one week day evening, he wore a linsey woolsey coat and a blue
                    worsted night cap. In praying the Harmonists do not rise up or kneel down, but bend their bodies

                    destroyed the upper floors and the tile-covered hip roof. During the Harmonist occupation it was

            <p>Until the early 1960s Dormitory No. 2 displayed on its southern facade a sun dial dated 1821. Made of

                    dial had been originally placed by the Harmonists on Father Rapp's house and served as the
                    town clock. When the mansion burned in 1844, the sun dial was put on No. 2 until an extensive state

            <p>Dormitory No. 4 was one of the last (1823–1824) of the large community buildings
                    constructed by the Harmonists. Like No. 2 it housed unmarried members of the Harmony Society. During
                    the Owen Community it also served as living quarters, and at one time its sixteen large rooms
                    accommodated sixteen families. Its greatest distinction, however, lies in the long and distinguished

            <p>Begun in 1822, the impressive brick church of the Harmonists was still not quite complete in December
                    of 1824 when Robert Owen arrived with the view of purchasing the Harmonist village. Both
                    Owen's son William and Donald Macdonald recorded that fact in their diaries. The English
                    traveler, William Hebert, who visited the society while the building was under construction, was
                    impressed with its "nobility" and "grandeur" and wrote an
                    excellent description of its appearance: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>These people exhibit considerable taste as well as boldness of design in some of their works.
                            They are erecting a noble church, the roof of which is supported in the interior by a great
                            number of stately columns, which have been turned from trees of their own forests. The kinds
                            of wood made use of for this purpose are, I am informed, black walnut, cherry, and
                            sassafras. Nothing I think can exceed the grandeur of the joinery, and the masonry and
                            brick-work seem to be of the first order. The form of this church is that of a cross, the
                            limbs being short and equal; and as the doors, of which there are four, are placed at the
                            ends of the limbs, the interiour of the building as seen from the entrance, has a most ample
                            and spacious effect. A quadrangular story or compartment containing several rooms, is raised
                            on the body of the church, the sides of which inclining inwards towards the top, are
                            terminated by a square gallery, in the centre of which is a small circular tower of about
                            ten feet in height, which is surmounted with a silvered globe. The reason assigned by our
                            guide for the erection of this fine edifice was, that the first church being built wholly of
                            wood, is found to be so hot during the summer, when the whole of the society are assembled
                            within it, as to be scarcely supportable, in consequence of which it was resolved to delay
                            the building of their houses for a time, and raise a more spacious and substantial place of
                            worship, and the one they are employed upon bids fairly to do them honor, both in the design
                            and execution. It is much more spacious than the number of their society requires. I could
                            scarcely imagine myself to be in the woods of Indiana, on the borders of the <placeName>

                            of this church. Here too the Englishman is once more gratified with the sound of a church
                            bell, which however harsh it may sometimes be thought by those who have never strayed beyond
                            the sound of one, imparts a gratification after a period of estrangement from it, as
                            connected with early associations, infinitely more soothing than could the most delicate
                            strains of music.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>The north door of the brick church with its stone lintel designed and executed by Frederick Rapp has
                    had an interesting history. When the church was taken down in 1874, it became the north door of the
                    public school built on the same site. When this early school was replaced by the present school
                    building in 1913, the door was moved to the west where it is situated today.</p>

            <p>Burial customs in the Harmony Society were simple. True to the Harmonists' stress on
                    equality in death as in life, no marker was placed on the graves. And because the Harmonists felt
                    that the life to come was all-important, death in this one meant only the cessation of work and
                    sorrow, with quiet sleep in the orchard burial ground until called up for the Second Coming.</p>

            <p>The Harmonists built labyrinths in all three of their towns. In mystic fashion they represented
                    Father Rapp's idea that one has to tread the tortuous way of life before attaining the
                    rewards of Heaven.</p>
            <p>A number of the visitors to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> mentioned the "pleasure garden," but the best descriptions remain in
                    the recollections of the children who grew up in the Owenite community. Victor Duclos, who came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1826 as a child of eight, remembered the labyrinth thus: "Within a circle
                    of about 140 feet in diameter there were formed concentric circles with growth of hedge plants,
                    presenting an intricate pathway leading to a small block house in the centre. The house was built of
                    blocks of wood about twelve inches long pointed at one end. These were placed with the pointed ends
                    outward to form a circular wall."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>Miner K. Kellogg, portrait artist, spent his eleventh and twelfth years as a participant in the Owen
                    Community (1825-1827). Sixty years after, he wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The first Labyrinth I ever saw was at <placeName>

                            constant amusement to children. Its lines were formed of vines grown upon light fences and
                            about four feet high, converging as they reached the centre. Here the visitor came upon a
                            circular hut made of the ends of rough logs cut to a point externally leaving one
                            window—&amp; a blind door which had to be sought out—&amp;
                            only found by pushing at the walls. I remember well my first visit to this hut, after a long
                            &amp; tedious run back and forth through the labyrinth. On seeking for the door a large
                            snake took a look at me from between the logs, laughing at me with its long red tongue. I
                            got back out of the labyrinth much sooner and easier than I found my way in.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>Music played a major role in the life of the Harmonists. Since the opportunity to study music was
                    available to anyone who wished, many did so, to the extent that the making of, or listening to,
                    music was their most popular pastime and formed an intrinsic part of their daily social and
                    religious affairs. According to Richard Wetzel, the Harmony Society period on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> "was one of intensive and methodical music study and the proficiency of the
                    orchestra in the late 1820s was the result of the teaching effort expended during this
                        time."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>Musically, 1817 was a banner year in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> with the arrival of some special musical instruments. The Rosenbaum "piano
                    forty" weighing 379 pounds, obtained from Abishai Way, and a special purchase from Allyn
                    Bacon Company containing, among other things, a pair of horns, cost $30.00; a pair of
                    bassoons, $30.00; and two octave flutes, $4.00, augmented the quality of the
                    Harmonists' orchestra and teaching opportunities. Inspired, perhaps, by the new
                    instruments, Father Rapp was reported in August to have "given out [a song] for singing in
                    the private devotion next Sunday."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

                    "O Nacht, und du O feyerliche Stille," was composed by the Society's
                    innkeeper, Frederick Eckensperger.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to George Rapp, Frederick Rapp and John Christopher Mueller were the main composers of
                    hymns for the Harmonists. Often the words, or poems, were original and set to popular German folk
                    sources, although both Mueller and Frederick sometimes composed their own music as well as the
                    words.</p>

            <p>Various travelers duly noted the social role music played in the Harmony Society. Young William Owen,
                    who lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> during the final months of Harmonist occupation, mentioned numerous occasions when he
                    and Captain Donald MacDonald attended social functions at which music was sung and played and in
                    which he joined.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Time was not only spent in performing, however; an equal amount of attention and effort was put into
                    the copying of music and other subjects as well. Many manuscript books now in the archives at
                    Economy, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, but produced in Indiana, attest to the progressive educational practices of the
                    Society. Both individuals and groups were encouraged to express their ideas in creative forms such
                    as hymns, songs, and poems or to copy the works of well-known literary personnages like Friedrich
                    von Schiller and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The familiar names also appear on these manuscript
                    books, which bear the dates they were begun and the names, and sometimes birth dates, of the persons
                    who compiled them. Frequently the title page was artistically done in fraktur with floral
                    ornamentation and the whole bound in leather. Subjects other than hymns are recorded: penmanship and
                    grammar exercises, arithmetic problems, and even, as in the case of Wallrath Weingartner's
                    books, directions for making dyes.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Below is a photograph of a hymn sung at

                    </placeName>, May 4, 1795. He was the son of Frederick and Christina Weingartner who emigrated with

            <p>In addition to the very important maps of the two Harmonies, Weingartner's most interesting

                    from various plates, regrouped them, and created new arrangements. Weingartner's text is an
                    abstract or resume of the Wilson essays that accompanied each of the bird drawings.</p>

                    </placeName>, George Rapp wrote a letter to Frederick, who was still in <placeName>

                     <div type="letter">
                        <p>I have searched through the entire land and found many advantages which it has; e.g.,
                                    I shall lead a little brook, which takes a left course about a quarter mile above
                                    the town now right through the middle street down the valley to the bank for general
                                    use, except the grinding mill. This will give me 14 to 15 foot fall, so the water
                                    can turn a mill half a year and often longer only 100 steps from the lower street of
                                    the town, and the brick maker, the tanner, and whoever else needs water for his
                                    trade can live along the stream. Then Gressing's creek has a beautiful
                                    stream of water, 9 to 10 acres [?]. On that place the sawmill should be built, and
                                    from there the water should be led into the town so that in the upper street toward
                                    morning it will run toward midnight toward the bank and have a fall of 14 to 15
                                    feet. The spring in Gray's land has a fall of about 5 feet down to the town
                                    and 3 quarter mile distant, and is so strong that it will drive a mill wheel the
                                    entire year without the springs and little creeks which in the vicinity of the town
                                    run out of the hills, and which can be used and still have quite a bit of water
                                    during this dry season, but they disappear underground because they have no decent
                                    bed on which to move. Furthermore, the mill site in the cutoff is the most beautiful
                                    and best mill site within a distance of 100 miles. The entire bed for a length of 2
                                    miles is a pavement of rock and no broader than your creek, and there is never a
                                    lack of water. Then by the town along the outer street toward south there is a small
                                    pond which has running water throughout the year.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                    planning their silk industry while still in Indiana. As their original planting of Lombardy poplar
                    trees died, they began replacing them with mulberries, an indication of future plans for the
                    propagation of silkworms.</p>
            <p>At Economy, as early as 1826, the Society began the development of silk manufacture under the able
                    direction of Gertrude Rapp. Very precise and detailed records were kept of this industry to the
                    extent that today the Society's archives represent an invaluable resource of information
