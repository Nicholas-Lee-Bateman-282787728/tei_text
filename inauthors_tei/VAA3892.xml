                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">T</hi> middle life my father found himself a poor man--a poor
                        country gentleman. It is not such a great misfortune to be a poor city
                        gentleman, for the latter is only one of many of all sorts and conditions.
                        He may easily lose himself in the multitude, or, if he dislike obscurity, he
                        may conceal from the public gaze the slenderness of his purse and affect an
                        appearance not justified by his fortune. But in the country one's goings in
                        and comings out, if in any sense or degree out of the common way, are likely
                        to attract attention and provoke comment of the kind one least desires.</p>
                    <p>In the Virginia county in which my father was born and had spent nearly all
                        his life, he was surrounded by old and well-to-do families with whom and
                        their ancestors he and his ancestors had <pb id="VAA3892-011" n="2"/>
                        mingled for many generations. They knew the extent of his estate to the
                        acre, and could compute his income with more than tolerable accuracy. If he
                        was compelled to part with a portion of the one or suffered a diminution of
                        the other they were certain to know it, and likewise the particular nature
                        of the adversity that moved to the sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>So, at least, my father found it when a mistaken confidence in others led to
                        his financial undoing. Usually such a blow as the loss of fortune is more
                        stunning when it is received than at any time afterward, but in his case it
                        was not that way. Not until he began to feel how surely the loss of money
                        carried with it deprivation, in some measure, of other things that he valued
                        more highly than money did he fully understand the extent of the disaster
                        that had overtaken him. Being a proud man and perhaps supersensitive, he was
                        cut to the heart when the realization came that he could no longer hold up
                        his head with the highest. True, he had not lost all. A remnant of his once
                        very considerable estate was left, but it was not sufficient to maintain his
                        establishment on terms of equality with the best. Our family continued to be
                        held in regard, for it was--let me say it--eminently respectable, but in my
                        father's view our very respectability only served to aggravate the evils of
                        our condition.</p>
                    <p>If we had been content to live as many do, and to drift along from day to
                        day, not caring for the <pb id="VAA3892-012" n="3"/> morrow, overlooking
                        slights and forgetting past things, it would have been easier for us.
                        Probably I should not say <hi rend="i">us,</hi> for I was not much at home
                        during those last melancholy days in Virginia, being in the military school
                        at West Point, where the government was doing what it could to fit me for a
                        soldier. I did not know all that was going on nor all that my father felt,
                        but his letters to me betrayed a very uncheerful spirit. His
                        dissatisfaction, indeed, constantly augmented, and he became possessed of a
                        fancy that there was a lack of the old courteous attention from those about
                        him. Finally a letter came telling me that he had accepted an appointment to
                        office in Washington--this was in the early days of President Buchanan's
                        administration--and that he and my mother would presently proceed to the
                        Capital, which they very soon did.</p>
                    <p>The appointment was accepted as an honorable means of getting away from the
                        old scenes, upon which such a different face had been put by his changed
                        condition, and, while fairly lucrative, proved irksome. It was not long
                        until he was ready to relinquish it. Could he have resumed his old place he
                        would gladly have returned to Virginia. As that could not be, he was looking
                        around, he wrote me. For one situated as he was the South then afforded few
                        opportunities for financial recuperation, even if there were <pb
                            id="VAA3892-013" n="4"/> ambition to try; this ambition he had not,
                        having lost his spirit and being none too strong.</p>
                    <p>The storm which a few years later broke with such fury was brewing. Its
                        mutterings could be heard by any man who would open his ears and listen. It
                        was despite this fact and not because of it that he took a very unexpected
                        step, in which no doubt he was encouraged by my mother who, in addition to
                        her most lovable qualities, was possessed of a strong will and great
                        selfreliance. This was no less than a removal, with all his belongings, to
                        Indiana. However influential my mother may have been in inducing this, at
                        the time, extraordinary change of residence, she was not wholly responsible
                        for it. Roger Bellray had much to do with it, but I have since come to
                        believe that my mother, with her woman's intuition, along with unusual
                        foresight, had prescience of the terrible events that were to happen in
                        Virginia and desired to get far away from the soil that was so soon to be
                        drenched with blood.</p>
                    <p>A bachelor, a man of affairs, a gentleman farmer and still young--such and
                        more was Roger Bellray. Having means and leisure, as well as natural
                        inclination, he had given a good deal of attention to politics--not,
                        however, as an office-seeker or office-holder, for he valued too highly the
                        freedom and independence of private citizenship to exchange them for the
                        cares of <pb id="VAA3892-014" n="5"/> place. He had spent some winters in
                        Washington as a looker-on, interested in the workings of the complicated
                        government machinery. He met and greatly impressed my discouraged father by
                        his vigorous and magnetic personality. Their acquaintance ripened into a
                        sudden and lasting friendship.</p>
                    <p>To him my father confided his determination to retire to some quiet country
                        place where he could busy himself with small affairs without disturbance. As
                        it happened, the estate adjoining Bellray's was then on the market at a
                        price well within the means still at my father's command. In the spring he
                        went West, and finding the place satisfactory, or at least as nearly
                        satisfactory as any could be that did not equal that which he had been
                        forced to relinquish, he bought it. I was advised of this contemplated
                        purchase, but while it seemed to me a poor business, there was no occasion
                        for me to set up my opinion in opposition to it.</p>
                    <p>The few years, as it befell, that yet remained to him were passed in peace,
                        if not in contentment. More by the thrifty management of my mother, acting
                        under the advice of Bellray, than by any business skill of his own, his new
                        possessions yielded returns sufficient to maintain a respectable
                        establishment without trenching upon the fund which had been set aside to
                        send <pb id="VAA3892-015" n="6"/> me abroad after my graduation, as every
                        male Trenham had been sent for a hundred years.</p>
                    <p>Having a taste for martial things, I was, through the influence of the
                        American minister, which we were yet able to invoke, admitted as a student
                        in a French military institute, and for two years devoted myself assiduously
                        to the task of receiving instruction. I was rather a seriousminded young man
                        and eschewed most of the follies to which many of those about me were
                        addicted. While in the main my stay in the institute was not unpleasant, I
                        was, as a foreigner, who was there merely by the grace of the French
                        government, subjected to many annoyances.</p>
                    <p>At first I was tolerated as a semi-barbarian and curiosity, but when it was
                        found that I was disposed to insist upon respectful treatment, although I
                        did so as mildly as the circumstances would allow, I met with some
                        difficulty at the hands of a few of the most violently inclined young
                        Frenchmen. The result was that I was forced into an encounter with a smart
                        yet reckless fellow who was put forward as the champion of those who had
                        determined to make me win my spurs.</p>
                    <p>Swordsmanship was taught there, as in all high class institutions of the
                        kind, and many of the students had acquired a degree of expertness that
                        would have been creditable even in those long-gone times when skill at
                        fencing was the first <pb id="VAA3892-016" n="7"/> requirement of a
                        gentleman. Fortunately for me--not only then but later--I knew something of
                        the art. I had set out early to acquire some knowledge of the uses of the
                        weapon and became greatly interested in the pursuit. The fencing master
                        asserted that I had a quickness of eye and a steadiness of nerve without
                        which the sword was as useless as a walking stick. Thus encouraged, and
                        finding that the exercise was invigorating and healthful, I continued it
                        with great spirit, not unmixed with a little pride.</p>
                    <p>So when I was given to understand by my friends in the institute that my
                        peace, and my standing in the eyes of my fellows, demanded that I should not
                        ignore the challenge of the fiery Venault, I accepted it. Although not
                        really a bad fellow at heart, Venault had a good many traits of the bully
                        and had terrorized half the school into submission to his domination. Not a
                        few of them desired to see him humiliated; and while they did not believe in
                        my ability to accomplish his overthrow, they were willing enough that I
                        should try.</p>
                    <p>Their ideas of America were dim and uncertain. In the minds of most of them
                        it was merely a far-away land which their own country had been principally
                        instrumental in wresting from the hated English, a land where men acquired
                        wealth by some species of magic and returned to civilized countries to enjoy
                        it. I did <pb id="VAA3892-017" n="8"/> what I could to give them a more
                        favorable understanding, but I fear that I really accomplished little before
                        my trouble with Paul Venault, and not greatly more afterward.</p>
                    <p>The morning came for our meeting. Dueling was, of course, prohibited, but
                        under the guise of a fencing bout, in which, if a wound was received, it was
                        proclaimed to be an accident, it was nevertheless carried on in very genuine
                        fashion. My opponent appeared on the ground fresh and confident, his young
                        mustachios daintily waxed and twisted, and his handsome eyes lively with the
                        excitement of the occasion. A fine specimen of the dashing, volatile Latin
                        was Paul Venault. In size and strength we were a fair match. He was nearly,
                        if not quite, six feet in height, sinewy, active and alert. What a swordsman
                        he would have made had it not been for his hot head and his proneness always
                        to hold an opponent too cheaply!</p>
                    <p>We stripped for the encounter and took our positions. Venault smiled at first
                        somewhat disdainfully, but at the onset he replaced the smile with a fierce
                        look which was meant to overawe me, as I have no doubt it had overawed
                        others. Fortunately for me, I very well realized that it was not fierce
                        looks that won battles of this sort, but good, steady sword-play. Much to
                        the surprise of all and to the deep humiliation of my opponent, the contest
                        went in my favor more easily than I <pb id="VAA3892-018" n="9"/> had
                        believed it would, and Venault was retired with a wound in his arm.</p>
                    <p>He had the manliness to congratulate me on my victory, but the heartiness of
                        the acknowledgment was marred by his professed belief that the thrust which
                        had disabled him was directed by chance. If this afforded him consolation I
                        was not the one to deprive him of it, though I knew the contrary to be the
                        fact. After this I got along fairly well and received from none more
                        considerate treatment than from Venault.</p>
                    <p>I have written of this experience in no spirit of vaunting, but because Paul
                        came once again into my life on a very different field, and also because it
                        is the easiest way to explain how I was able to bear myself with credit in a
                        more serious encounter under most unusual circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Only meager information came to me as to what was happening at home. My
                        father had written of the great contest for the presidency then going on
                        with a heat and virulence of faction never before known, and gave it as his
                        opinion that Lincoln's success meant the attempted secession from the Union
                        of the southern states and then war between the sections. My ideas as to the
                        causes of the trouble were, I fancy, at that time hazy and inaccurate. For
                        two years I had been abroad, giving more heed to present concerns than to
                        thoughts of future strife between my countrymen.</p>
                    <p>In a general way I knew that there had been <pb id="VAA3892-019" n="10"/>
                        bitter sectional contention at home in which the question of slavery was in
                        some way involved--for there had been trouble at West Point between the
                        northern and southern lads--but I had not dreamed that the conditions were
                        so acute as my father's letters indicated. As a southerner born my
                        sympathies were with the South, so quick are we to believe that our own
                        people must be right and everybody else wrong. I eagerly awaited further
                        intelligence, which had to come by the slow process of the mails carried by
                        the not too rapid steamers which then traversed the Atlantic.</p>
                    <p>Late in December a letter reached me, written by my mother, conveying the
                        serious tidings that my father's health, which long had been delicate, had
                        taken a sudden turn for the worse and she had grave fears for his life. She
                        urged me to return home immediately, and enclosed money for my journey. A
                        line added at the bottom of the last page, as if an afterthought, told me
                        that Lincoln had been elected to the presidency. Only the bare fact was
                        stated, without comment, and thus I had no confirmation or otherwise of my
                        father's misgivings; but she took little interest in politics at best, and
                        was thinking then, no doubt, only of her husband's state.</p>
                    <p>Settling my few affairs as fast as possible, I set out for Paris to get my
                        passports. From the papers there, which usually devoted but little attention
                        to the affairs of America, I learned that a <pb id="VAA3892-020" n="11"/>
                        crisis was thought to be approaching in the United States which threatened
                        the integrity of the republic. This, if well founded, would be good news to
                        Louis Napoleon, to whom republics, since the time of his own treachery to
                        France, were a constantly menacing nightmare. A January voyage across the
                        Atlantic was not what I would have chosen, but there was no alternative. The
                        tone of my mother's letter convinced me that there should be no avoidable
                        delay. It was a terrible journey through gales, driving rains, sleet and
                        snow, but it was accomplished at last.</p>
                    <p>On arriving in New York, I found, during my few hours of necessary detention,
                        that everybody was in a state of feverish excitement. All around could be
                        heard the shouts of the newspaper venders, crying that another state had
                        seceded from the Union. This, I soon learned, was Georgia, the fifth to take
                        that momentous and, as it proved, almost fatal step. There were plenty about
                        to enlighten me as to what had been done, as well as to what was being done.
                        Without doubt the country was on the verge of war. National property in all
                        the seceding states had been seized, including arsenals and forts and the
                        navy-yard at Pensacola. The authorities at Washington were bitterly assailed
                        for not putting forth a strong hand and suppressing the insurrection in its
                        incipiency, and were wildly accused of being in league with treason.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-021" n="12"/>
                    <p>"What of Virginia?" I asked later of a bystander at the railway station.</p>
                    <p>"Virginia is still true, but she is expected to go the way of the others," he
                        answered, gloomily. "You are of the North, I suppose?"</p>
                    <p>"I am a Virginian," said I, proudly, and added, "but just returned from
                        France."</p>
                    <p>He looked about him apprehensively, and then, coming a little nearer, so as
                        not to be overheard, he said: "You are safer than I, yet, for I am a South
                        Carolinian, and my state has led the procession out of the Union," saying
                        which he walked quickly away from me and was lost to my view in the
                        crowd.</p>
                    <p>Safer! So it had already become a question of personal danger. I had told him
                        that I was a Virginian, which was the truth, yet my home was in Indiana. The
                        anomalous position in which I was placed had barely occurred to me before,
                        but it struck me now with full force. Beyond any question at all Indiana
                        would stand by the Union. My father had expatriated himself from Virginia,
                        but had I? Except the short period of three months that I had spent with my
                        parents just prior to going abroad I had never been in the state to which
                        they had removed. I was worried and perplexed. If war came I ought to bear a
                        part. Otherwise, why had I been educated in soldier craft?</p>
                    <p>Two days of continuous travel were required to <pb id="VAA3892-022" n="13"/>
                        make the trip from New York to the old capital town of Corydon, a few miles
                        outside of which, to the northward, lay my father's new possessions. My
                        route took me through a country intensely hostile to the South. The critical
                        condition of the republic was almost the sole topic of conversation among my
                        constantly changing fellow-passengers. A few argued in favor of letting the
                        southern states go, declaring that it would be a good riddance, but by far
                        the greater number held that the Union should be preserved at all hazards.
                        Into these arguments I did not obtrude, and I noticed that there were others
                        who, like myself, did not deem it expedient to put forward their opinions,
                        and, who, when now and then appealed to, remained steadily
                        non-committal.</p>
                    <p>It must not be understood that these things, absorbing as they were,
                        engrossed all of my thoughts. I was deeply concerned about my father, always
                        kind and generous, who had poured out upon me, as the only child, a full
                        measure of affection. I had been absent a long time, and how should I find
                        him? And my loving mother, who had laid everything at my feet since that
                        day, now twenty-two years gone, when I first came helpless into her arms,
                        how was she?</p>
                    <p>There came into my mind, too, a vision of another--a spirited little maid of
                        glorious promise--Kate, Roger Bellray's young sister. She must be nearly
                        eighteen by now, and if the flower <pb id="VAA3892-023" n="14"/> was as
                        beautiful as the bud--ah! I was young; how should I find Kate Bellray?</p>
                    <p>Finally I reached the end of my travel by rail at Jeffersonville, from which
                        point I took stage for Corydon, something more than twenty miles away,
                        arriving there late in the afternoon of a day of clear sky and sharp north
                        wind. Hastily partaking of a little refreshment, I entered the conveyance
                        that I had ordered to carry me over the few miles yet separating me from my
                        father's house, leaving my baggage to follow on the morrow. Darkness had set
                        in by the time we drew rein in front of the wide porch of southern fashion,
                        from which my mother waved her hand in farewell on that September day when I
                        started on the journey from which I was now returning. How should I find
                        them? The rooms were alight down stairs. Jumping out I discharged the
                        driver, hastened toward the house, up the steps and gave the old-fashioned
                        bell a pull that could have been heard from garret to cellar. The door was
                        opened presently by the well-remembered black servant Martha, a slave in
                        Virginia, but here free, yet who clung to my family closer than if she were
                        still bond.</p>
                    <p>"Marse John!" she exclaimed, throwing up her hands as if I were an
                        apparition.</p>
                    <p>And then the good soul began to cry and buried her face in her gingham apron.
                        I understood very well from this that my father was dea.</p>

                    <p>M<hi rend="sc">Y</hi> father's death, of which I was not wholly unprepared to
                        hear, had occurred two weeks before my arrival. It was a great shock to me
                        and an overwhelming grief to my mother, but my presence went far to comfort
                        her. She now leaned upon me in all things, and sought advice which I was
                        poorly prepared to give. But I went to work diligently to acquire a
                        knowledge of our affairs and found them to be in good condition; and yet how
                        our present position contrasted with that from which we had been deposed!--
                        a bare three hundred acres as against as many thousands, a modest, but roomy
                        and comfortable house as against the imposing mansion within the walls of
                        which generations of Trenhams had been born, and where they had laughed, and
                        wept, and lived, and died. Where happy slaves in that still recent time gave
                        willing service, now four or five paid servants did all the work of house
                        and farm. Father had never become reconciled to the change, but mother,
                        possessing a more elastic temperament and a cheerfulness <pb
                            id="VAA3892-025" n="16"/> fulness of disposition not easily shaken,
                        accepted it without a murmur. Only on his account and mine was she ever
                        known to express a regret, and this, being buoyant and hopeful, I labored to
                        dispel so far as it concerned myself.</p>
                    <p>We were a litttle removed from direct communication with the world, but by
                        means of the Louisville newspapers were kept tolerably informed as to what
                        was going on. The new president was inaugurated in March. His address on
                        that occasion, while intended to be pacific, was unsatisfactory to the South
                        and was looked upon by the leading secessionists as menacing.
                        Representatives of the seceding states met and agreed upon a plan of
                        confederation. Both sides began to arm, and those conservative people in
                        both sections--there were many of them--who had hoped for peace, lost heart.
                        And well they might, as things went from bad to worse with each passing day.
                        At last, about the middle of April, came that direful news from Charleston
                        harbor, that open defiance of the national government which constituted an
                        act of war. It was so accepted everywhere, and preparations for that
                        miserable, unhappy family conflict, so long dreaded, and now, thank God, so
                        long past and forgiven, were redoubled.</p>
                    <p>I had but slight acquaintance in our locality, and aside from occasional
                        trips to Corydon, now and then extended to Louisville, I stayed mostly at
                            <pb id="VAA3892-026" n="17"/> home, doing what I could to mitigate my
                        mother's sorrow, and to aid in the management of her affairs. Roger Bellray,
                        who had gone to Washington, as was his custom, and on to New England, as he
                        told me, to visit his sister who was there in school, came home a few weeks
                        after the inauguration. Until then I had not seen him since my return. He
                        was gloomy and cast down, and told me then that all efforts toward
                        compromising the issue between the sections had come to naught. He blamed
                        the hot-heads north and south for the threatened disruption of the Union,
                        which he deplored as a calamity, but which, he insisted, there was no
                        constitutional power to prevent. The secession of the southern states he
                        held to be a great political blunder, but to restrain them by force of arms
                        would be a crime. In his view each of the states of the Union was sovereign,
                        and was as free to withdraw its consent to a continuation of the compact
                        into which it had entered as it had been in the first instance to give
                        it.</p>
                    <p>"We are going to the devil," he said finally, "and when the crash comes, as
                        it will come, every man must look out for himself."</p>
                    <p>The constitutional phases of the question did not interest me, and so I did
                        not allow myself to be troubled by them. What I saw was that that portion of
                        the country with which my family so long had been identified was arraying
                        itself against <pb id="VAA3892-027" n="18"/> that other portion which my
                        father, mild man as he was, always asserted had been guilty of unjust
                        encroachments. Virginia did not join the Confederacy at once, but did so in
                        May, and not long afterward the people of the South looked over the border
                        toward the people of the North, and the faces of both were as flint.
                        Presently they clashed and struck fire. Gods! beneath the flint there was
                        blood and it ran red and fast.</p>
                    <p>My graduation from the academy at West Point entitled me to a lieutenant's
                        commission, but this I had resigned in order to continue my studies abroad,
                        and was thus free to take such course as I saw fit. Many officers of
                        southern birth had already sent in their resignations from the army and
                        hurried back to their states to accept commands in the forces of the new
                        Confederacy. No doubt I should have followed their example had not my
                        previous action made such a step unnecessary; but I was glad then, and am
                        now, that I was not put to such a choice.</p>
                    <p>What should I do? I had grown up with my full share of prejudices against the
                        North, which my four years at West Point had not removed. The northern and
                        southern youths were, as I have said, at arm's length during the last half
                        of my stay at the academy, and quarrels led in several instances to personal
                        collisions, in which each contestant was given satisfactory proof of the
                        metal of his opponent. In all affairs of this <pb id="VAA3892-028" n="19"/>
                        kind that came under my observation, I enacted the ungrateful and always
                        difficult role of peacemaker whenever possible. In one unfortunate instance
                        I not only had my trouble for my pains, but later was compelled to defend
                        myself against a classmate from Georgia, who imagined that I had offended
                        him. But for the most part I sided with my fellow-southerners in the
                        imperfect arguments by which the cadets sought with feeble success to
                        convince each other of error.</p>
                    <p>My stay abroad had done much to nationalize my feelings, and heaven knows
                        that had it not been for that ill-starred and deplorable division, the
                        iniquity of which I did not see until long afterward, I should have returned
                        to America with an intensified love of my native land. But in my youthful
                        eyes then Virginia was my native land more surely than the wide republic of
                        united commonwealths, and the new home of my parents was scarcely better
                        than alien territory. Indeed, as I viewed it, it was alien in truth from the
                        moment Virginia adopted the ordinance of separation, and cast her fortunes
                        with the other seceding states. Try as I would, and did, for my mother's
                        sake, to think otherwise, I could not rise above the feeling that I was
                        merely a sojourner in Indiana, with no tie to bind me there save that of
                        filial duty to a loved one so newly and sorely bereft.</p>
                    <p>As the war progressed, I became more and <pb id="VAA3892-029" n="20"/> more
                        restless, and with the unreckoning ardor of youth longed to throw myself
                        into the conflict. To remove one obstacle I tried to persuade my mother to
                        dispose of the farm and go to Richmond--the chosen capital of the new
                        Confederacy--where she had relatives, but she steadfastly answered that she
                        would stay where she was, near the grave of my father, and that when her
                        time came, in God's providence, she would be buried there by his side. No
                        words could meet that simple argument, and I attempted none nor did I yet
                        have the heart to leave her in her loneliness. She clung to me now as all
                        that remained to her, and felt--though she did not say it in words--that I
                        should not ask her to make so great a sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>To her, war was merely a many-headed monster, with tremendous capabilities
                        for death and heart-break. Was there ever a woman, unless, indeed, she were
                        carried beyond herself by some overwhelming zeal or frenzy, who, without
                        hesitation, gave up a son to battle? If there were ever such it was not my
                        mother. She begged and implored me to wait--wait. I know that she hoped and
                        tried to make herself believe that the war would be brought to a speedy end,
                        as millions of others did; but it grew and spread and became increasingly
                        more bitter and implacable. It was soon evident that it was to be a struggle
                        to the very death, and that the end would only come when <pb
                            id="VAA3892-030" n="21"/> the resources of one or the other of the
                        contestants were exhausted.</p>
                    <p>One evening, late in July, I rode over to Bellray's house, scarcely more than
                        a mile away, which gleamed large and white in a grove of maple and elm
                        trees. As I approached I heard a girl's voice singing a new northern song.
                        Looking about me I saw the singer, simply dressed in some white material,
                        coming along the orchard path toward the house. Her face was partly
                        concealed by a wide-brimmed "sundown" of straw, held in place by pale blue
                        ribbons tied beneath her chin. Seeing me, the song was suddenly suspended,
                        but the girl came on. I secured my horse at the gate and went up the walk. A
                        turn in the path had thrown the house between us for a moment and I stopped
                        and waited for her to reappear, for this must be Kate Bellray whose
                        home-coming had been expected for some days. Presently she turned the corner
                        of the building. It was she, only the promising child had come to be a
                        woman. I essayed to speak.</p>
                    <p>"Miss Bellray, I believe?" was the best I could do. And how weak it sounded,
                        as if there were the least question in my mind as to who she was!</p>
                    <p>"Have I changed so much that you are in doubt?" she asked, smiling. "Or had
                        you forgotten me?"</p>
                    <p>"You have changed, certainly, and just as certainly <pb id="VAA3892-031"
                            n="22"/> I had not forgotten you. A victim rarely forgets the one who
                        put him on the rack."</p>
                    <p>"Is it because of that that you remember me?" she said, the old mischievous
                        sparkle in her eyes.</p>
                    <p>"I must have been worse than I thought."</p>
                    <p>"The memory has been a pleasant one," I returned, "so pleasant that time and
                        distance have not effaced it."</p>
                    <p>And so we began very much as we had left off three years before, but she soon
                        became serious enough, as, seated in the shade of the wide porch, we talked
                        of many things. Fresh-faced and clear-eyed, with the curving beauty of
                        girlhood just rounding into womanliness, she made the most attractive
                        picture I had ever seen. In figure she was neither short nor tall, and as
                        graceful in every movement as the willow when bending to the kiss of the
                        south wind. Her mouth showed a line of firmness without obstinacy that gave
                        a key to her character. Never have I seen eyes like hers, at once so full of
                        intelligence and so expressive of her emotions. Whether in mirth, anger or
                        sadness--and I have seen her in each state--the beholder must perforce yield
                        to their spell, for her very soul seemed to look out upon him. I am not
                        skilled in the art of describing physical perfections, but did I possess it
                        in superlative degree I could lavish it all, without degrading it, upon Kate
                        Bellray as she then was. She had temper, and was given to moods--what <pb
                            id="VAA3892-032" n="23"/> man or woman is not?--and I have felt them
                        all, and sometimes writhed under them, but I nevertheless aver--but why
                        should I aver anything? So partial a witness might be doubted.</p>
                    <p>Roger, who had gone to Corydon, came back while I was still there, bringing
                        word of the first battle at Manassas, in which the Union forces were not
                        only defeated, but had fled in panic back upon Washington, which city was
                        believed to be in danger of capture. I had a feeling of exultation over the
                        fact that the invading army had been driven from Virginia, which must
                        unconsciously have shown in my face.</p>
                    <p>"This news pleases you, sir," said Miss Bellray disconcertingly.</p>
                    <p>Somewhat taken aback, I hardly knew what answer to make, so direct and
                        unexpected was the attack. "One naturally sides with his kith and kin," I
                        returned haltingly, with a feeling that my face had grown suddenly red.</p>
                    <p>"One should not do so unless sure that they are right, and it can never be
                        right to make war upon one's country," she exclaimed, with fine
                        emphasis.</p>
                    <p>"It depends on the point of view," said I.</p>
                    <p>"Don't argue with her, John," said Roger, laughing. "She is as contentious as
                        ever; in fact, a regular firebrand, and wholly incorrigible."</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Trenham was educated for a soldier, and be certainly will not run away
                        from a girls' arguments" <pb id="VAA3892-033" n="24"/> she retorted, but in
                        such plain good humor that it carried no sting.</p>
                    <p>"He would rather face a battery no doubt; at least I should. A girl's
                        argument is like her hair--she arranges it to suit herself, and not always
                        in proper fashion," her brother returned, helping me out of what seemed to
                        him an awkward situation, but which, indeed, I did not find unpleasant, as I
                        watched the girl's animated face.</p>
                    <p>"But, Sir Roger de Coverley, you forget that I have studied logic as well as
                        hair dressing."</p>
                    <p>"Come, Kate, drop the de Coverley, as I did long ago; and also drop logic.
                        Don't you know that it has been said over and over again that there is
                        nothing quite so unwomanly as logic?"</p>
                    <p>"Is it so?" she cried, tossing her head in mock seriousness. "Then allow me
                        to ask a question; that, at least, is one thing that women will not be
                        denied: Was the loss very great in this miserable battle?"</p>
                    <p>"The number of killed and wounded on both sides is large, and, as for the
                        missing--well, the whole Union army is missing," Roger answered soberly.</p>
                    <p>"Terrible!" she exclaimed. Then looking at her brother keenly she added: "You
                        seem disposed to make light of the misfortune of your country."</p>
                    <p>The thrust was sharp, but he was prepared to parry it. "Perhaps it is not a
                        misfortune, <pb id="VAA3892-034" n="25"/> my sister. This disaster may teach
                        lessons much more valuable than would have been the winning of the victory.
                        And, at any rate, it will be safe to wager that every raw lad who tried to
                        out-foot his comrades to Washington will, when put to another test, die in
                        his tracks before he runs again. That is human nature, and he will never be
                        on good terms with himself until he has been given another trial at his
                        enemy."</p>
                    <p>She looked at him gratefully, her ruffled feelings being smoothed by his
                        diplomacy. The conversation was soon turned into a less dangerous
                        channel.</p>
                    <p>Kate was an ardent patriot. She had been for more than three years at school
                        in a city that had been a hotbed of Abolition sentiment. The south had there
                        been pilloried in the public eye for a generation and more, and she had been
                        deeply impressed with what she believed to be the sinful transgressions of
                        the southern people. There was nothing personal or individual in her
                        antipathy, for she had thought well of my father, and looked upon my mother
                        with open affection. During her vacations, which she spent at home, she had
                        been much at our house, I was told, and brightened it with her young and
                        cheerful presence. It was there that I first met her, a rosy maiden of
                        fifteen joyous years, somewhat given to romping.</p>
                    <p>At the beginning she had been a little shy of me, but on a better
                        acquaintance this feeling vanished <pb id="VAA3892-035" n="26"/> and she
                        indulged in the delightful pastime of vexing me in every way that a quick
                        wit could suggest. I had sense enough to see the utter lack of malice in her
                        behavior, and soon came to have a thorough enjoyment of her most elaborate
                        schemes of torture. She had come into my mind very often in the three years
                        that had elapsed since, not seriously, however, but as an interesting
                        recollection. For, be it understood, I then held myself to be a man and she
                        a mere slip of a girl, destined, no doubt, to grow into a lovely woman. In a
                        physical way, certainly, this destiny was fulfilled in even larger degree
                        than I had imagined, and as to her other attributes there never had been
                        room for the least question. The old inclination to place thorns in my
                        pathway, knowing that I would stumble upon them and furnish her amusement in
                        extricating myself, was held in check, but not entirely subdued. Now and
                        then it was given liberty during the next year, in which we were much
                        together.</p>
                    <p>Her intense Unionism--which I was not inclined to regard as serious in a
                        woman--and my anomalous and wholly unsatisfactory position gave her
                        opportunities of which, in the main, I will say to her credit, she availed
                        herself sparingly. Being naturally kind of heart, she very soon learned that
                        here was the vulnerable point through which my feelings could be most sorely
                        harassed. But even toward this tender spot she would at <pb id="VAA3892-036"
                            n="27"/> times, when I had been so unfortunate as to irritate her by
                        some reference to the South, direct her sharpest javelins, and I, helpless
                        to pluck them out, would smother the pain they caused me as best I
                        could.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes for days I would avoid her, so keenly did I feel the humiliation of
                        my position of inaction in the great struggle now going on almost at our
                        doors, about which she frequently rallied me. But as the needle responds to
                        the magnet without reasoning why, so would I turn again toward this fair
                        star of the north who attracted me so powerfully. I think she clearly
                        understood on these occasions that in keeping away from her I was not moved
                        by childish pique. Had she thought otherwise she could not, with her
                        qualities, have treated me with the respect, and a something bordering on
                        contrition, that she took no pains to conceal when we would again come
                        together. For this I was grateful, and for a time we would get along
                        smoothly enough, laughing off the old trouble and vowing to avoid further
                        offense.</p>
                    <p>What made my lot the harder to endure was the knowledge that very many of the
                        best young men in the county had gone to the war. By far the greater number,
                        of course, went into the national army, but it was more than suspected that
                        some, for one reason or another, had slipped quietly across the Ohio river
                        to join the Confederate <pb id="VAA3892-037" n="28"/> forces. Roger Bellray
                        himself told me of instances of this kind, and no man was better informed
                        than he as to what was going on in our locality. The loss to the North in
                        this manner was, it was clearly apparent, fully made up by the accessions to
                        its strength which came from the South. Nothing can more effectively
                        illustrate the lack of unanimity of sentiment in both sections, unless it be
                        those numerous and fully accredited instances of persecution and
                        door-to-door warfare for opinion's sake, which raged then and later in many
                        states on both sides of the Ohio.</p>
                    <p>Among those who had joined the national army was young Philip Deverny, a
                        member of an influential family living not far beyond the Bellray place. He
                        had recently been at home suffering from a disabling wound received in the
                        battle at Shiloh, and wore the uniform of a lieutenant of cavalry. I saw him
                        last at Bellray's one evening just before he departed to rejoin his
                        regiment, then at Corinth. Self-contained and handsome, with the prestige of
                        a soldier who had been in battle, I felt that in his presence I was
                        overshadowed. And yet nothing could have been more considerate and
                        circumspect than his conduct; it was exemplary, and in all respects above
                        reproach. We talked about our differing views, but we did it as gentlemen,
                        and at parting he expressed the hope that one day we might <pb
                            id="VAA3892-038" n="29"/> meet in the field, though not in personal
                        strife; a hope that I gladly seconded, but which nearly failed of
                        réalization.</p>
                    <p>For some time afterward Kate treated me with a reserve and curtness of manner
                        which, while largely unconscious and not intended to offend, wounded me
                        deeply. I could not but attribute it to the contrast that she must have
                        drawn in her mind, to my very great disadvantage, between myself and the
                        lieutenant. I had no cause to be jealous of him--even if I were disposed to
                        entertain so base a feeling--for Kate herself had told me that he had long
                        paid court to Betty West, her one intimate girl friend. So far as that
                        matter is concerned, nothing had passed between Kate and me that gave me a
                        claim upon her to the exclusion of any one else, and I made no pretense of
                        asserting any.</p>
                    <p>But she must know why I, educated for a military career, apparently dawdled
                        at home while others hastened to the front where courageous men fought and
                        died for what they believed to be the right. If she did not know I could not
                        tell her. I could not put forward my lonely mother and her appeals to me to
                        tarry yet awhile, to shield me from the criticism that my non-action seemed
                        to merit.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE PLACARD ON THE POST</head>
                    <p>O<hi rend="sc">NE</hi> day a small party of us were returning from a visit to
                        the great Wyandotte cavern. While living only a few miles away, I had never
                        before seen its many wonders, and for my benefit Roger Bellray and his
                        sister had arranged the expedition. Bellray, with my mother and Mrs.
                        Willing, an elderly aunt, who for years had looked after his household, went
                        in a carriage, but Kate and I had preferred to go on horseback.</p>
                    <p>It was while returning homeward from this excursion that I suffered the
                        sharpest vexation of spirit at her hands, followed by the swiftest amends.
                        We rode in advance of the others, and being able to make better speed, even
                        without haste, we soon left them out of sight. She had behaved well
                        throughout the day, but now an unlucky reference of mine to some caverns of
                        the South opened up the old difficulty.</p>
                    <p>"They are, of course, vastly superior to the Wyandotte," she said, with a
                        sudden change of manner.</p>
                    <p>"I had not said so," I returned, propitiatingly. <pb id="VAA3892-040" n="31"
                        /> "I never saw them, but am told that they are quite fine."</p>
                    <p>"Certainly they are; they must be," she exclaimed, tossing her head
                        scornfully. "As the South surpasses us in everything else, it naturally
                        excels in caves."</p>
                    <p>Putting whip to her horse, she galloped furiously ahead, as if determined to
                        get as far as possible away from my unfortunate South, and from myself, its
                        no less luckless son. How she tried my patience! But I was resolved to keep
                        my temper. She presently slowed her pace, and allowed me to come up with
                        her. I waited for her to speak, but she remained silent.</p>
                    <p>She did not look at me at once, but leaning forward she stroked with one
                        small gloved hand the arched neck of her thoroughbred Kentuckian. Her back
                        was to the low-lying September sun, which tangled its rays of fire with the
                        golden brown tints of her hair. I could not see her face, but the cheek
                        toward me was aflame. After a little time she turned her head, and I saw
                        that the threatened storm had not completely passed over.</p>
                    <p>"It seems to me a little strange, Mr. Trenham, that you should remain in such
                        a commonplace country as this after having experienced the delights of your
                        southern paradise," she said steadily.</p>
                    <p>This was too much. "God knows that I have <pb id="VAA3892-041" n="32"/> been
                        ready to leave it for many long months, not because it is commonplace, but
                        because it is not mine," I broke out with some bitterness, forgetting, in
                        the face of this new provocation, my good resolution.</p>
                    <p>"What restrains you?" she asked, with harrowing coolness. "Other men have
                        gone who would have liked to stay."</p>
                    <p>"You know very well what has kept me," said I, in a voice that sounded hard
                        and unnatural to my own ears. "I wonder that you can ask such a
                        question."</p>
                    <p>She looked a little alarmed, and some of the color left her face. I was
                        exasperated and hurt, and restrained my anger with difficulty. I fancy that
                        she saw the wound she had inflicted, and that it was deep. She changed about
                        completely.</p>
                    <p>"I have again offended you," she said, with an air of contrition, "and, while
                        I have many previous transgressions against your good nature to reproach
                        myself for, I must now admit renewed guilt, and ask your pardon."</p>
                    <p>"To be offended I must feel," I returned, my inward wrath not wholly
                        appeased; "and to feel I must be made of blood and bone, tissue and nerves
                        like other men. Does it just now occur to you, Kate, that I am not wood or
                        iron, or baker's dough?"</p>
                    <p>"Don't be foolish, John," she said, looking straight down the road. It was
                        the first time <pb id="VAA3892-042" n="33"/> she had called me by this name
                        since she had come home, and I was at once disarmed. She turned her face to
                        mine and continued: "I have no disposition, really and truly, as you ought
                        to know, to hurt you in any way, and I am sorry for having done so. Indeed,
                        I must confess my surprise that you have all along taken my poor opinions so
                        seriously. Nobody else does, except Betty West. When I talk at home about
                        the war and such things Aunt Sarah is inclined to go to sleep and Roger
                        busies himself with something, smiles and says 'yes' and 'no' without any
                        relevancy whatever. No doubt I have imposed on you, and you have borne it
                        all like a gentleman--a real southern gentleman, too--and there are such, I
                        know, for you and your father have proved it. But I have liked you for it,
                        even when I must have seemed to you most unfeeling, if not actually
                        barbarous."</p>
                    <p>"So," said I, wholly mollified, "you and Betty West agree?"</p>
                    <p>"Perfectly. And she is a sensible girl, too. Of course she is <hi rend="i"
                            >only</hi> a girl, but may not a girl know something?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes; something, certainly." To the word "something" I gave a decided
                        emphasis, for I did not know to what extent the wisdom of Betty West might
                        be appealed to.</p>
                    <p>"She doesn't know everything, as the men do," <pb id="VAA3892-043" n="34"/>
                        she retorted with equally definite meaning, always ready for battle, "but
                        what she does know she knows as well as any one."</p>
                    <p>This statement of the proposition was so conclusive and irrefutable as to
                        leave no ground for argument. "Both of you think that I should pattern after
                        Philip Deverny, I suppose."</p>
                    <p>Kate started a little and made haste to answer. "No, John; I have not talked
                        to her about you --that is, not in connection with the war." A tell-tale
                        blush, which I was quick to see, deepened the color of her cheeks.
                        "Lieutenant Deverny has made a good soldier, but you are capable of making a
                        better one. Betty thinks of him, and weeps for him and prays for him. Had
                        the need been, she would have urged him to go, and if necessary she would
                        beg him to stay to the end. And yet she would give her heart's blood to have
                        him with her again. She looks to see his name in every list of killed in
                        battle, yet she glories in his danger, for she knows that he is fighting for
                        his country."</p>
                    <p>"It is proper for Betty to think and feel these things respecting Deverny
                        since he is acting in a way that pleases her. But suppose he had gone out to
                        fight against the North?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, that would have made a very different case," she responded quickly. "If
                        he had done that she would detest him."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-044" n="35"/>
                    <p>"Well, suppose I should conclude to do it; how would you regard me?"</p>
                    <p>I realized as soon as I had uttered the words that I had put to her an unfair
                        question. She flushed and began to flick in confusion at some thistledown
                        that had lodged on her riding skirt. I made haste to relieve her.</p>
                    <p>"Don't you see my position here?" I asked.</p>
                    <p>"I have seen that you were troubled," she said, evading a direct answer. "You
                        have shown your feelings plainly."</p>
                    <p>"I am troubled," I exclaimed, all the misery of my position rushing upon me;
                        "I have fretted until my brain has burned and my heart has become at times
                        as dry as a puff-ball. I have waited, hesitating, chafing until almost
                        beside myself. Were it a mere question of saving the Union I would fight for
                        its integrity, and fight to extend its borders if the chance offered. But
                        this is a mere fanatics' war, a sort of new crusade waged against my
                        Christian kin of the South. The northern men have already made a
                        charnel-house of my native state. Its soil has been reddened with the blood
                        of my relatives, poured out at their very doorsteps. You must imagine, for I
                        can not tell you, how much I have suffered and endured, how many wakeful
                        nights and bitter days I have passed while struggling between loyalty to the
                        old flag and duty to the people among whom I was born."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-045" n="36"/>
                    <p>She turned her eyes now full upon me, and in her face I read an encouraging
                        sympathy. But she did not speak, and I, determined to make as good a defense
                        for myself as I could, went on:</p>
                    <p>"Ah, Kate, if my poor father had been content after the break in his fortunes
                        to remain in Virginia my course would have been easier to choose. But such
                        was his pride that he could not endure his fallen state in the company of
                        those who had known him in prosperity. So he came here, lived a few quiet
                        years and died, thank God, before this unhappy conflict began. But he
                        foresaw it, and his heart remained true to the Old Dominion. Notwithstanding
                        that his dust is mingled with the soil of your country, I would, in my
                        selfishness, for the pain it has caused me, curse the day when he came to
                        the North if it were not-- I may as well say it--if it were not for
                        you."</p>
                    <p>"John, John," she cried impulsively. "You say this, when I have added so much
                        to your burden, and perhaps may add still more, for I am very unruly." She
                        nervously fingered the handle of her riding whip.</p>
                    <p>"Yes; if you had done many times as much, I would still say it," I declared.
                        "You could not understand all of the difficulties of my situation, and so
                        you have blamed me for not espousing the cause of the North. But do you not
                        know that many who are native here are not <pb id="VAA3892-046" n="37"/>
                        even now clear as to the course that they should pursue?"</p>
                    <p>"It is true," she returned slowly, a shadow upon her fair face. "And how
                        presumptuous you must think me for putting my girl's opinions against yours
                        and that of my own brother. But Roger talks about the constitution, and
                        reasons and doubts; you argue and hold back; while I, being a woman, feel
                        and believe that I know. That is a woman's way and privilege, but being a
                        woman, I must perforce stay at home and dream of things I would do if I
                        could, or which, at least, I think I would do. Roger greatly provokes me,
                        though he is the best of brothers."</p>
                    <p>I could easily understand how Roger's conduct affected her, for at this time
                        his relations with neighboring ultra Unionists were far from being amicable.
                        He was suspected of being disloyal, and I, on two occasions, had gone with
                        him to the house of Colonel Mandrell, in Louisville, who was known to have
                        favored the secession of Kentucky. The making of this statement involves no
                        violation of confidence, as will be seen.</p>
                    <p>What transpired between them the first time I do not know, for shortly after
                        our arrival they withdrew to the Colonel's library for private converse
                        while I was engaged socially with Mrs. Mandrell and her daughters. Before
                        our departure I was called into the library, and there received most
                        extraordinary proof of the old gentleman's <pb id="VAA3892-047" n="38"/>
                        favor. For this, later, I was thankful, as it enabled me to extricate myself
                        from a very disagreeable situation. As to the second occasion, that also
                        will appear.</p>
                    <p>"Pardon me, Kate," said I, seeing that in my eagerness to excuse myself I had
                        made a mistake. "I had no intention to drag your brother into our little
                        discussion. He is an honorable man; his views, whatever they are, are
                        conscientious and he is entitled to maintain them. I merely referred to a
                        class. As for Roger and me, it has been hard for us both, much harder than
                        you can guess. Your New England schooling has made it difficult for you to
                        bear with us patiently, I fear."</p>
                    <p>I accompanied this statement with a smile which I meant to be conciliatory,
                        but which she perversely misconstrued. "You laugh at me, sir," she said with
                        spirit, lifting her head defiantly.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, it is not so bad as that," I hastened to say. "But the air of
                        Massachusetts, so long breathed by the Phillipses and the Garrisons and
                        other fomenters of sectional ill will is not the atmosphere in which
                        tolerance and charity ripen."</p>
                    <p>This only made the matter worse, and convinced me that I was a poor diplomat.
                        There had been times when I had purposely aroused her, so keenly did I enjoy
                        the flashing of her fine eyes when the subject under discussion was not <pb
                            id="VAA3892-048" n="39"/> too tender. But the present occasion did not
                        warrant such questionable indulgence. To her the men named by me were little
                        short of demigods.</p>
                    <p>"Do not concern yourself as to how it happens that I think as I do," said
                        she, with nettled temper. "I surely have proved to you that I have
                        convictions, whatever their source. You may laugh at them, if you please,
                        and at my boast as to what I should do if I were a man. But I know, Mr.
                        Trenham, that your 'Christian kin of the South,' as you call them, are
                        seeking to tear down the best government in the world in order that they may
                        continue to hold their fellow-creatures in bondage, and that to this end
                        they have driven the country into a terrible war. If I <hi rend="i"
                            >were</hi> a man," she cried, "I would openly take one side or the
                        other. I would take to the field and fight my enemy face to face, and not
                        ally myself with traitors at home, and fight from ambush."</p>
                    <p>My face burned hot at the thought that she could consider me capable of such
                        perfidious action as her last words implied, but by an effort I answered her
                        calmly.</p>
                    <p>"I do not know why you should speak to me of joining traitors at home and
                        fighting from ambush. Nor can I believe that you want to wound me beyond
                        recovery. I take my full measure of blame for all that you have said and
                        implied. Now let us drop this unhappy and profitless topic. <pb
                            id="VAA3892-049" n="40"/> Between us it is like a knife that cuts in the
                        handling, whether we will or no. If we pursue it further it may leave scars
                        that we can never entirely conceal from each other. Besides, we are nearly
                        home."</p>
                    <p>Always ready for truce as she was for battle, she became suddenly pacific.
                        "You are right, John; sometimes you can be right, can't you?" --this with a
                        glance of the eye that set my heart thumping. "I am a silly goose, and you
                        are a great big, wise, good-natured man. Otherwise how could you suffer my
                        many impertinences, for such they must have appeared to you, although they
                        were actually not so intended. There, now, I am good again; but I really
                        must say things at times."</p>
                    <p>"So I have learned," said I, laughing, "and you know how to say them,
                        too."</p>
                    <p>She laughed also, a merry, ringing laugh, as if she were glad of the chance.
                        We had been proceeding slowly, and had come by now to the arched entrance of
                        the maple-shaded lane leading from the highway to her brother's house, which
                        from the top of the knoll looked upon the surrounding country with an air of
                        confident prosperity. There was no gate, only two wide planked posts
                        surmounted by the segment of a circle with a large letter B in the center.
                        Nailed to one of the posts was a fresh, flaring placard, which I could read
                        very well without dismounting.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-050" n="41"/>
                    <p>"What have we here?" I said, drawing rein to inspect the placard.</p>
                    <p>The first line, in bold type, caught my eyes and held them to the paper, as
                        well it might. It ran thus: "A Military Order." Then came the following:</p>
                    <p>"In order to repel invasion and insure the public safety, it is hereby
                        ordered, that all able-bodied white male citizens, between the ages of
                        eighteen and forty-five, <hi rend="i">who reside in the counties bordering
                            on the Ohio river,</hi> in this State, immediately upon receiving notice
                        of this order shall meet at their respective places of holding elections in
                        their respective townships, towns or wards, and form themselves into
                        companies for military duty. The members of said companies will immediately
                        arm and equip themselves with such arms and equipments as they can procure,
                        and will prepare themselves, by discipline and drill, for active service
                        with the least possible delay. All persons liable to do military duty, as
                        above provided, will be held to a strict observance of these orders, and the
                        colonel or other officer of the Legion who may be in command in each of said
                        border counties is charged with their faithful execution."</p>
                    <p>The order was signed by the governor, as commander-in-chief. It contained
                        some other matters of detail, but the provisions which I have quoted were
                        the ones that concerned me.</p>
                    <p>"What does it mean?" asked Kate, doubtfully. She had looked it over, but did
                        not seem to have fully grasped its import.</p>
                    <p>"Very much," said I, with a great sense of <pb id="VAA3892-051" n="42"/>
                        personal relief. "To me it means freedom and absence; it is the cast of the
                        die. I can not obey this order. To do so would be a wicked stultification of
                        my opinions and conscience. But it makes me free and determines my course,
                        and for that I am thankful."</p>
                    <p>"And Roger?" she asked, beginning to see.</p>
                    <p>"He will find a way," I answered, yet I knew that to him this order, if I
                        understood his opinions and character, meant annoyances and possible
                        persecution.</p>
                    <p>My answer did not seem to satisfy her, and for a little time as we walked our
                        horses toward the house she was silent. Presently she asked: "Is there such
                        great necessity for this extraordinary command? One would think from reading
                        it that the rebels were at our doors redhanded."</p>
                    <p>"The governor must believe that an emergency exists," I responded. "And
                        perhaps he is right. A Confederate army has started toward the North. It is
                        in Kentucky, and it is said that Louisville is to be taken. From that city
                        Indiana is just across the river. Who knows what may happen?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, the traitors!" she exclaimed, raising a clenched hand aloft</p>
                    <p>"Pardon me," said I deprecatingly; "traitors if they lose their cause. If
                        they win, they will not be so recorded. Historians judge of such things by
                        the result."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-052" n="43"/>
                    <p>"Win or lose, they are traitors just the same. A crime is no less a crime
                        because it is successfully perpetrated," she rejoined firmly.</p>
                    <p>"And I?"</p>
                    <p>"And you; you are yet innocent, and I only accuse the guilty," she returned
                        sadly.</p>
                    <p>Here we came to the gate, from which ran a graveled walk to the house.
                        Dismounting, I reached up my hands and assisted her to alight. I did not
                        mean to delay my departure, and would take my leave of her at once. But it
                        was more difficult than I had thought when contemplating the probability
                        that now faced me as fact.</p>
                    <p>The war had lasted more than a year, and during all that time I had been
                        living in the borderland of hell and paradise. The dearest creatures on
                        earth to me were here. For their sakes I would make any sacrifice short of
                        my honor. I had honestly tried to convince myself that I should help to
                        uphold the flag and the government under which I was born, but in the
                        opinion of my people that government had become a tyranny, and its flag an
                        emblem of oppression. They were arrayed against it, struggling for what they
                        believed to be right; and, right or wrong, their fortune must be mine. It
                        was a time of blood and passion and unreason. It was hard to see and think
                        clearly, and if I erred it was not strange.</p>
                    <p>"Kate," said I, "very soon, I fear, I shall be <pb id="VAA3892-053" n="44"/>
                        equally guilty in your eyes with those others. I can not stay here longer.
                        For my honor's sake it would have been better to do before this order what
                        must now be done in the face of it. It looks too much like holding back
                        until forced to make a choice of armies in which to fight, and that were
                        things otherwise I would not go at all. But my mother and you and Roger will
                        know the truth, and I care nothing about what others may think. No man knows
                        what will be the end, or when it will come, but I must play a part in this
                        great tragedy. What fortune or fate has in store for me, and for us all,
                        time will tell. I will not see you again, as I shall leave to-night or
                        to-morrow morning at the latest. Good-bye."</p>
                    <p>I took her unresisting hand and looking into her face saw that she was deeply
                        moved by some emotion. When she spoke her voice trembled and was very low
                        and soft.</p>
                    <p>"I am glad, and sorry, too; glad that at last you have settled a question
                        that has vexed you so greatly, and sorry that you have settled it wrongly.
                        Overlook my vanity in assuming that I am right and you wrong, for Roger said
                        truly when he told you that I was incorrigible," she added, attempting a
                        smile, but it was a poor counterfeit of the natural one that had so many
                        times in my presence glorified her countenance and warmed me with its
                        sunshine. "Wherever you are, God be with you. Good-bye."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-054" n="45"/>
                    <p>She turned from me, but not before I had seen that her eyes were suffused
                        with tears. Mounting my horse I rode away. Looking back as I turned into the
                        highway I saw her standing by the gate, and a white handerchief fluttered
                        from her upraised hand. A truce, indeed.</p>
                    <p>A little further along I passed Roger, but did not stop. Turning again
                        presently, I saw that he was apparently reading the placard on the post.
                        Then came a sweeping motion of his arm, and he cut it down with his carriage
                        whip.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">GIVE ME ROAD, SIRS</head>
                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">S</hi> I made my way home I felt elated and almost happy, but
                        as one from whose limbs shackles had just been removed, leaving them galled
                        and sore from long chafing. No doubt as to my mother's consent to my going
                        now troubled me. She could see as clearly as I that there was no other manly
                        course open to me. But the only anxiety that disquieted me concerned her.
                        How would she be treated by the extreme loyalists when it became known that
                        her son had at last cast his fortunes with the people of the South whom they
                        held to be rebels and traitors? That seemed to me to be a serious question;
                        yet as she was a woman of tact and lived quietly, giving offense to none,
                        she would probably suffer no serious molestation.</p>
                    <p>Besides, she would have the protection of Roger Bellray, if she should at any
                        time be threatened. He had given me to understand that if ever I should make
                        up my mind to leave I could do so without fearing in the least for her
                        welfare. So strong and masterful was his personality, and so <pb
                            id="VAA3892-056" n="47"/> numerous and powerful were his friends, that
                        the most rabid would hesitate before provoking an open breach with him.</p>
                    <p>These considerations reassured me, and I entered my mother's house with all
                        doubts and anxieties dissipated. I found her in her room, where she had gone
                        to rest from the day's fatigue before coming down to the evening meal which
                        she had ordered to wait my return. I had always been very proud of my
                        mother, who retained so much of the good looks of her younger days. She had
                        never cared much for society, and so was not greatly disturbed by her
                        present isolation from the old familiar scenes and places.</p>
                    <p>Latterly the bright young faces of Kate Bellray and Betty West had appeared
                        often in our house, greatly relieving its somberness, if, in truth, that
                        quietness which had rested within its walls since father's death can
                        properly be called somber. The liveliness of their spirits greatly revived
                        her own, and I felt that I could trust them to continue their ministrations.
                        Indeed, my absence, I felt sure, would serve to encourage one of these girls
                        to increase the frequency of her visits.</p>
                    <p>The war was a topic that my mother avoided in my presence as much as
                        possible, hardly ever broaching it herself, and tactfully getting away from
                        it when I brought it up, as I did very often. Not that she lacked interest
                        in it--for I knew that it must be otherwise; her seeming indifference was
                            <pb id="VAA3892-057" n="48"/> on my account. While meaning to be dutiful
                        and affectionate, as I felt that I was in all respects, I was assertive and
                        impetuous, and inclined to rebel against the restraints that detained me
                        from the activities of the field.</p>
                    <p>Of course I did not put it that way before her, or rave and tear my hair and
                        accuse her of selfishness or a lack of regard for my feelings. Very far from
                        it; but she understood, and aimed only at drawing me away as much as she
                        could from the evident cause of my distress. I think, after she became
                        convinced that the war was to be prolonged, she never really believed that
                        she could do more than postpone the day of our separation.</p>
                    <p>And now, when I told her how matters stood, she did not make my lot harder by
                        giving way to tears and protestation. On the contrary, after the first shock
                        had spent its force, she affected a cheerfulness that I knew she did not
                        feel, and at once set about the task of arranging the few necessary
                        belongings that I would take with me.</p>
                    <p>That night, while in my room making preparations for my departure, there came
                        a knock at the door. Supposing it to be Peter come to take orders as to
                        getting my horse ready I called out that he should come in, not suspending
                        my work or looking around. The latch clicked, a step sounded on the carpeted
                        floor, and then a hand slapped me on the back. Annoyed, I turned <pb
                            id="VAA3892-058" n="49"/> about to rebuke the familiarity, when I saw
                        that the visitor was Roger Bellray.</p>
                    <p>"I beg your pardon, Mr. Bellray; I thought it was Peter," I said in excuse of
                        my apparent incivility.</p>
                    <p>"It is for me to apologize for intruding upon your privacy," he said; "but I
                        thought we could talk while you worked, and I could not let you go away
                        without seeing you."</p>
                    <p>He took a seat by the open window that looked out toward the road, and I
                        explained to him that I was glad he had come as I intended to be on my way
                        at midnight.</p>
                    <p>"Your resolution is somewhat suddenly taken, is it not?" he asked.</p>
                    <p>"The balance tipped against me and I have no honorable alternative," I
                        answered, yet in a moment regretting that I expressed it that way, for his
                        face colored with offense.</p>
                    <p>"You refer to the order commanding all able-bodied men to join the Legion,"
                        he said curtly, and with something like a sneer.</p>
                    <p>"The same that I saw you strike from your post," I returned.</p>
                    <p>"That was my legal privilege, the post being my property and situated on my
                        ground. I will teach even the legionaries that I still control what is my
                        own, and that my consent to its use must still be sought."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-059" n="50"/>
                    <p>"Of course," said I, smiling in spite of myself, for his manner was earnest
                        to the point of intensity, "you took no exceptions to the placard
                        itself?"</p>
                    <p>"I have no right to do so," he answered, fairly. "It gives notice of an order
                        that is proper for the governor to issue, and one which should be obeyed by
                        all who feel that they can conscientiously obey it. When one acts within his
                        rights, be he a private citizen or public official, I have no quarrel with
                        him. No man shall ever accuse me of denying to another what I claim for
                        myself."</p>
                    <p>I had missed my point. There was no room to doubt his sincerity, and as I
                        looked into his steady blue eyes, I saw behind them a resolute and daring
                        spirit, which would defy the world if need be, and ask neither favor nor
                        odds.</p>
                    <p>"But, damn them, they can't use my posts without asking my permission," he
                        continued hotly, and then he added, as if quickly repenting of his outburst:
                        "Don't mind me, Trenham; I am an impatient man, at the best, and just now I
                        am entirely upset. Everything is going wrong about here. Like a man walking
                        on ice, I can't tell when my feet will slip from under me."</p>
                    <p>"Lucky you'll be if there is nothing tied to your neck when they do slip,"
                        said I, encouragingly.</p>
                    <p>He looked at me, half smiling. "You think <pb id="VAA3892-060" n="51"/> I
                        stand a chance to be hanged, do you? Well, don't worry about that; the rope
                        is not made that will hang Roger Bellray," he said, without a quiver.</p>
                    <p>"Possibly not; but they are making ropes every day, and some of these
                        stay-at-homes are itching to use them."</p>
                    <p>"Look here, my lad, what's the matter with you? Why do you talk so
                        grewsomely? Are you scared?"</p>
                    <p>"Why should I be afraid?" I answered. "I will presently be well out of this
                        if there is no bad luck lying in wait for me. And as to you, my friend, for
                        heaven's sake be careful. I am not old enough or experienced enough to give
                        you advice, but somehow I have felt for some time, and now more strongly
                        than ever, that dangers here are increasing."</p>
                    <p>"Tush! You have heard the barking of a lot of coon hounds who only fill the
                        air with their yelping. And then, what do I care for danger?" he cried. "It
                        only gives relish to life, which is dull and commonplace without it. You
                        prefer the field as I did at your age, but now I would rather be a
                        conspirator, quietly contriving with others to uphold a principle or defend
                        a right, with the halter as the penalty for failure. It gives to your
                        actions a keener zest, and sharpens every waking hour, aye, and most of your
                        sleeping ones, with the possibility of discovery before you are <pb
                            id="VAA3892-061" n="52"/> ready to act. You can not be certain of friend
                        or foe, and the man on whom you most rely may be the first to betray
                        you."</p>
                    <p>"Indeed," said I, "it is a game not at all to my liking."</p>
                    <p>"Compared with it," he rejoined, "your shooting and carving is but a vulgar
                        sport. Mind you, I do not say that I am a conspirator; I do not hold myself
                        to be such, but people give different names to the same thing. One who marks
                        out a course for himself counter to that pursued by the majority, as I have,
                        must proceed cautiously to avoid conflict, and very often he is driven to do
                        in secret what he would much prefer to do openly and above board."</p>
                    <p>"And hence," said I, "the institution of the knightly Order of the
                        Acorn."</p>
                    <p>"Which you refused to join, even after I had explained its purposes. I do not
                        blame you for that. Every man must act according to his view." He sighed a
                        little disappointedly.</p>
                    <p>"Whatever may be your purposes, your organization, when it is known, will be
                        held treasonable. I remember who is governor here, and I do not care to put
                        my head in this lion's mouth. He may do no roaring, but he will strike.
                        Besides, you and these others and myself are on a different footing
                        altogether. You belong here and I can not feel that I do, and so refuse to
                        mix in your local disagreements. As I understand it, <pb id="VAA3892-062"
                            n="53"/> you do not favor the war from any standpoint, while I, upon the
                        issue as I see it, am with the South and can't help it. I am going to join
                        Morgan, if I can reach him, and he will give me at least plenty of
                        exercise."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, and plenty of fighting, too, and luck be with you; I knew him in
                        Mexico, then a young dare-devil of a lieutenant of cavalry," said he,
                        warmly. "As for me and my friends, we mean to look out for ourselves and aid
                        those who, in these terrible times, will need aid such as we hope to give,
                        that's all. We are just as much entitled to our opinions as anybody else,
                        and the fact that, without hope of glory, we hazard everything, life and
                        home and honor, in defense of these opinions should be a sufficient guaranty
                        of their sincerity."</p>
                    <p>He stopped for a minute while he lighted a cigar; then he went on:</p>
                    <p>"This is a fanatics' war, as you have often declared to me, but the fanatics
                        are not all in the North--not by a long shot. In common with thousands of
                        others, I had hoped a conflict would be averted, but the fools in the North
                        and the fools in the South dug the pit and expect us, who had no hand in the
                        digging, to throw ourselves into it so that they can ride over us to glory.
                        Fourteen years ago, when a boy of twenty-two, I carried a musket into the
                        City of Mexico. One of Santa Anna's bullets is still in my body. And <pb
                            id="VAA3892-063" n="54"/> here," he said, raising the long mustache that
                        drooped over his left cheek, hiding a short, ragged scar, "is where a
                        Mexican bayonet enlarged my mouth. I don't speak of these things to
                        exonerate myself from a suspicion of cowardice, but merely to show that a
                        man may be willing to fight a foreign enemy, yet remain a non-combatant in a
                        strife between his own countrymen. At any rate, I shall be responsible for
                        my own conduct; whatever risks I take are my risks, and whatever end I may
                        come to is my end. In all the wide world there is only one person who will
                        long care what may happen to me, and that is my sister. You know how I love
                        that girl, John. Since the death of our mother, ten years ago, I have
                        guarded her as the very apple of my eye. She was but eight then, and while I
                        suppose she is a woman now, she is still a child to me."</p>
                    <p>While speaking of Kate his voice softened, and both words and manner
                        indicated profound affection and solicitude.</p>
                    <p>"She is thoroughly loyal to the government, and if she were of our sex I
                        verily believe there would be no keeping her out of the army. At times she
                        makes it rather uncomfortable for me."</p>
                    <p>He paused for a moment, and then continued, reflectively: "I wonder how she
                        will act when she comes to know the whole truth about me? That is what
                        worries me, John. The only thing that makes me hesitate to pursue the course
                        I <pb id="VAA3892-064" n="55"/> have chosen is the fear of her reproaches.
                        When I think about that it almost makes a coward of me."</p>
                    <p>"And what will she think of me?" I asked, making a pretense of unconcern by
                        taking up and examining one of the pistols that I had laid upon the table.
                        But I could not as easily disguise my feelings, and was conscious that my
                        voice carried a tone of uneasiness. As he did not make immediate answer I
                        lifted my eyes and found him looking at me intently. Then I could not wait
                        for him to speak.</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Bellray," said I, with shaking voice, and not as connectedly, I fear, as
                        I here set down my words, "since I may not see you again--and, at best, will
                        not see you soon--it is just as well that I tell you how matters stand with
                        me. I love Kate; I have never told her so, and now may never have an
                        opportunity to tell her, but I love her with all my heart. If the time ever
                        comes when I can say this to her she will doubtless spurn me as unworthy.
                        She will readily forgive you, her brother, but not another, I fear. No one
                        knows better than I how she feels, and that has prevented me from telling
                        her what I have just told you. If I survive, it may be that she will not be
                        too hard on me; if I do not--well, tell her how I tried to persuade myself
                        to do as she wanted me to do."</p>
                    <p>I turned away my face to hide its burning, affecting <pb id="VAA3892-065"
                            n="56"/> some excuse, for I was young and not practiced in such
                        avowals.</p>
                    <p>"You know that I have always thought well of you, John," he said. "If I did
                        not think so now I would be quick enough to tell you. You say you have never
                        spoken to Kate, but I can easily guess how she feels toward you. And I very
                        much mistake her spirit if it does not happen that she will think in the end
                        vastly more of you for following your convictions than she would if you
                        should for any reason, least of all to satisfy her, act the part of a sneak
                        and hypocrite by believing one thing and doing another."</p>
                    <p>I took his hand, and, pressing it fervently, thanked him for what he had
                        said, for it had done me good. He looked at his watch and rose to go.</p>
                    <p>"Now, my boy, since you have determined to leave so summarily I must not
                        detain you, as you will have to make your farewells to your mother. As to
                        her--and it is one reason why I came tonight--her safety shall be my
                        responsibility. Honestly, however, I believe that you need fear nothing on
                        her account. There are plenty of fellows about here who would get after you
                        or me, but they are not likely to war with a woman. I think I am justified
                        in putting that to their credit in advance."</p>
                    <p>I followed him out of the house, and saw him mount his horse and ride away in
                        the moonlight, <pb id="VAA3892-066" n="57"/> alert and confident. He was the
                        sort of man who would flinch from no danger, if, through the peril, lay the
                        road to an object which he was bent on accomplishing.</p>
                    <p>His courage fed on antagonism, and the more he was opposed the more
                        aggressive he became. An opinion entertained at first in a casual way
                        became, if combated, a settled conviction which he would thenceforth
                        maintain at all hazards so long as it was made the subject of dispute.</p>
                    <p>Stern and uncompromising as to those things in which he believed, he was yet
                        tolerant of the rights of others, and had acquired a wide influence in all
                        the surrounding country, which, while it afforded him a sort of protection,
                        was also destined to be the cause of his undoing.</p>
                    <p>Returning into the house, I finished my preparations, aided by my mother,
                        who, dear woman, acted most nobly. And when at last Peter brought around my
                        horse, a splendid animal of great speed and endurance, which I depended upon
                        to carry me into the Confederate lines, and to serve me afterward, she
                        smiled as she kissed me, as if she could conceal from me the knowledge that
                        her poor heart was on the point of breaking.</p>
                    <p>But it was not in her nature to part from me thus. She overestimated her
                        strength of will, and at the last minute broke down and wept and clung to me
                        as if she would not give me up <pb id="VAA3892-067" n="58"/> After a time
                        she controlled her feelings and bade me good-bye with composure, but the
                        picture of her distress was in my mind for many a day.</p>
                    <p>My calculation was, by easy traveling, to reach Louisville early on the
                        following morning, my further progress to be guided by circumstances, and by
                        such information as I could there procure from Colonel Mandrell. I
                        apprehended no danger in making the twenty-five miles that lay between my
                        mother's house and the Kentucky metropolis.</p>
                    <p>Yet I did not forget that the whole country was aroused over the reported
                        proximity of the Confederate army. Many of the country people believed that
                        it was even then besieging Louisville, while still others, equally
                        ill-informed but more fearful, had it that that city had already fallen
                        before the rebel assault, and that Indiana was to be immediately invaded and
                        laid waste. Such rumors as these were already current, and the governor's
                        order assembling the legionaries, and commanding all of military age to
                        prepare for active duty in repelling invasion would add fuel to the fire of
                        unrest and alarm that was consuming all the borderland.</p>
                    <p>By traveling at night I might be saved the annoyance of many awkward
                        questions, even if I should subject myself to suspicion from such as I
                        might, by chance, pass or overtake on the road. But these I reckoned would
                        be few, since the <pb id="VAA3892-068" n="59"/> country was not yet
                        regularly patrolled as it was very soon afterward. No doubt, however, as to
                        my ability to satisfy all inquiries and disarm the over-curious possessed
                        me.</p>
                    <p>I exulted in my new freedom, and as I rode along, expanding my chest with the
                        sweet night air, the spirit of adventure rose within me, and I felt equal to
                        any fate. Excepting my pistols, I was unarmed, for I did not yet desire to
                        assume too much of a war-like appearance, my purpose being to make my way as
                        quietly as possible, as any citizen might do whose mission was peaceful.</p>
                    <p>I had covered the first few miles of my journey without any kind of
                        interruption, and was congratulating myself on the good fortune that this
                        fact seemed to augur, when, far down the road ahead of me, I heard
                        badly-attuned voices of men raised in song. At first I could not tell
                        whether the singers were going from or coming toward me, but very soon I
                        knew that they were approaching. Now and then one would withdraw his
                        attention from the chorus long enough to shout long and loud, without any
                        other apparent object than that of testing the power of his lungs. Presently
                        they came close enough for me to make out the words of the composition.</p>
                    <p>"We'll hang Jeff Davis on a sour apple tree," <pb id="VAA3892-069" n="60"/>
                        ran the line of the chorus, which was three times repeated; then came the
                        roaring final line,</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">"As we go marching on."</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>After this there was a brief period of loud talking, a little more shouting,
                        and then the singing of the following improvisation, to the same tune:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">"We're going down to Louisville to meet old General Bragg,</l>
                        <l n="2">And in the fight, if he wants one, you'll see none of us lag,</l>
                        <l n="3">And we'll drive him back to Tennessee, behind his dirty flag,</l>
                        <l n="4" rend="ti-1">As we go marching on."</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>We approached each other rapidly, but so interested were they in their
                        singing and shouting that they did not observe me until I had started to
                        turn aside to give them the road. There were three of them, roystering young
                        farmers returning home from drill with the legionaries, I conjectured, and
                        half intoxicated. Seeing me they checked their horses, and one of them
                        called out tipsily in his newly acquired military phrase:</p>
                    <p>"Halt! Who goes there?"</p>
                    <p>"A friend," said I, falling into his humor.</p>
                    <p>"Why," said another of the three, "damned if it ain't the young Virginny
                        fellow, boys, who lives over there by Roger Bellray, the butternut; the one
                        that I was telling you about."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-070" n="61"/>
                    <p>"Mebbe you can trade horses with him, Spelker," said the first speaker,
                        laughing good naturedly.</p>
                    <p>They blocked the road, and as I was anxious to proceed and did not like the
                        voice of the one called Spelker, who was much older in appearance than his
                        two companions, I determined to make the interview a short one.</p>
                    <p>"Give me road, gentlemen, and allow me to pass," I said.</p>
                    <p>But Spelker was not through yet. I recognized in him a horse buyer who was
                        said to practice swindling operations at the expense of the government, and
                        he appeared bent on extending his acquaintance.</p>
                    <p>"I believe you are running off to join the secesh," he said, riding his horse
                        up to mine menacingly.</p>
                    <p>"I am pursuing my way peacefully," I answered, though my temper was rising at
                        his insolence, "and desire to be allowed to proceed."</p>
                    <p>"Well, there's no hurry, I guess; I want to ask you a few questions first,
                        and then mebbe we will let you go on, and mebbe we won't."</p>
                    <p>Reaching out his hand he caught hold of my bridle rein. I restrained an
                        impulse to strike the fellow, and asked: "By what authority do you question
                        me?"</p>
                    <p>"Just because I want to; that's authority enough for me."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-071" n="62"/>
                    <p>"But it is not for me," said I, by this time having, without attracting his
                        attention, possessed myself of one of my pistols, "and I decline to be
                        questioned. Take your hand from my rein, sir."</p>
                    <p>"My young rooster, I'll have to clip your comb for you," he cried, raising
                        the butt of his heavy riding whip threateningly.</p>
                    <p>Before it could descend I leaned quickly out and struck him full on the side
                        of the head with the heavy pistol, at the same instant driving home my
                        spurs. My horse sprung forward, and as I raced along I heard the curses of
                        Spelker, which were answered by the derisive laughter of his companions,
                        from which I judged that they were not sorry for his discomfiture.</p>

                    <p>W<hi rend="sc">ITHOUT</hi> further incident I reached about daybreak the town
                        of New Albany, a few miles down the river from Louisville. Here the heights
                        were ominous with heavy cannon, which frowned over the fords and lowlands
                        from hastily constructed fortifications, and told of the preparations that
                        were being made to receive the invader and hurl him back if he should
                        attempt to cross the river. Many citizens were already stirring, but little
                        attention was bestowed upon me. In response to an inquiry for news, I was
                        told that the rebel general, Bragg, was expected before Louisville at any
                        hour, as he had, my informant understood, the evening before sent forward a
                        message demanding the surrender of that city.</p>
                    <p>Following the road leading eastward, parallel with the north bank of the Ohio
                        but separated from it by some hundreds of yards, I saw, as I went along,
                        groups of armed men here and there gazing anxiously southward. Scattered
                        among them and occupying positions of vantage for <pb id="VAA3892-074"
                            n="64"/> sight-seeing were early-risen residents of the locality, who,
                        if less warlike in appearance than the others, were no less concerned.</p>
                    <p>I could see them excitedly talking and gesticulating and pointing frequently
                        across the broad river that lay between them and the yet unseen rebel host,
                        its bosom alive with every kind of craft capable of carrying guns. But it
                        was in front of them, and not behind, that the danger lay, so I passed on
                        and reached the Louisyille ferry without molestation or question. Having
                        marked out my course, I proceeded boldly, with no hesitation or visible
                        timidity, though I confess to a feeling of disquietude.</p>
                    <p>When the boat had tied up on the Kentucky side an officer with two or three
                        men came aboard before any were allowed to land. The passengers were not
                        many, consisting principally of gardeners and hucksters bringing provisions
                        into the beleagured city who were vouched for by the ferryman as regular
                        patrons. I observed that the officer performed his duty somewhat
                        perfunctorily as though it were a useless formality, and felt relieved. My
                        turn to be questioned came, the officer first demanding to know my name.</p>
                    <p>"John Trenham, sir," said I, looking him in the face. There was a sudden,
                        almost imperceptible contracting of his eyelids, but no other change in his
                        features.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-075" n="65"/>
                    <p>"From where do you come, Mr. Trenham?" he next asked, placidly.</p>
                    <p>"From my mother's home, near Corydon." If I had said that I came from the
                        moon his countenance would, I am certain, have given no sign of
                        surprise.</p>
                    <p>"Why are you coming to Louisville?"</p>
                    <p>"To fight, sir," I said, "if I get a chance," meaning to satisfy and yet
                        deceive my interrogator by telling him the simple truth. In both of these
                        respects I felt that I had succeeded, for he told me without further ado
                        that I could go on my way, which I lost no time in doing.</p>
                    <p>Once within the city I found that even at this early hour great activity and
                        excitement prevailed in the streets and public places. It seemed that all of
                        the inhabitants had been abroad for hours, if indeed they had sought their
                        beds at all during the previous night. The shops and stores were closed and
                        shuttered, and business of all kinds was suspended. Upon every face there
                        was a look of expectancy, and many hot eyes showed dread as of an impending
                        calamity.</p>
                    <p>At places where there was open ground, squads of men in citizens' clothes
                        were marching and maneuvering at the command of drill-masters, who were in
                        most instances in uniform, while standing about watching them, silent and
                        lowering, were still other citizens.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-076" n="66"/>
                    <p>Between the drillers and the on-lookers there was, I knew, a wide and bitter
                        difference of opinion, and but for the restraining presence of the soldiery
                        with which the city was filled they would willingly have flown at each
                        other's throats. For this was a border metropolis which embraced within its
                        walls a population sharply divided between loyalists and disunionists, but
                        now it was in control of the national authorities who were preparing to hold
                        it against the threatened attack of the Confederate general.</p>
                    <p>I sought a hotel, and stabling my horse near by, determined to spend the day
                        quietly, and did so, for the most part staying in my room and getting sleep
                        and rest that might stand me well. Not knowing how matters might be with
                        him, I made no effort throughout the day to communicate with Colonel
                        Mandrell, who, be it understood, was not now a military officer as his title
                        might imply.</p>
                    <p>He had commanded a regiment with distinction in the last war. Now he was not
                        only out of favor with the national government but was believed, with
                        reason, to hold intimate relations with the secessionists. So far no act
                        justifying his arrest had been traced to him, and he had gone in and out
                        unhampered and defiant. I deemed it wise, however, to take no unnecessary
                        chances, and did not set out for his house until well after darkness had
                        fallen.</p>
                    <p>A walk of a half a mile or thereabout carried <pb id="VAA3892-077" n="67"/>
                        me beyond the blocks of business houses and into a residence district, upon
                        which the needs of trade had not then encroached. Turning into the street
                        upon which the Mandrell residence was situated, I quickened my steps and
                        soon reached an iron gate opening upon the lawn surrounding a large brick
                        mansion of old fashion, standing well back from the street. Lifting the
                        latch I went in, and, observing nothing unusual, strode confidently up to
                        the door and rang the bell loudly.</p>
                    <p>I was not kept waiting long, for the reverberations of the bell had not died
                        away when the door was opened and a young man of attractive visage, standing
                        within the glare of the hall lamp, bade me enter. This surprised me not a
                        little, as I had expected to see the face of a negro servant of the house,
                        but I accepted the invitation and entered. Following the young man into the
                        parlor, I asked if I could see Colonel Mandrell.</p>
                    <p>"I fear not," he responded, smiling pleasantly. "Colonel Mandrell has felt,
                        let us say, obliged, temporarily to depart from his comfortable house." Here
                        he waved his hand about as if directing my attention to the luxurious
                        appointments of the room.</p>
                    <p>"Indeed," said I, still more surprised; "you are a friend of the family, I
                        suppose?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, not exactly so; to tell the truth--and no good can come from deceiving
                        you--I have no <pb id="VAA3892-078" n="68"/> acquaintance with the Colonel's
                        family, which I understand to be a very estimable one."</p>
                    <p>"Then, pray, sir, may I ask in what capacity I am to address you in making my
                        further inquiries?" said I, feeling nettled, and yet conscious that no cause
                        for offense had been given.</p>
                    <p>"In the capacity, I should say," he returned, still smiling, "of an unwelcome
                        guest who, in pursuance of orders, has been compelled to intrude himself
                        into a house upon which he has no claims to hospitality."</p>
                    <p>I must have looked the amazement I felt upon hearing this confession,
                        smoothly made and accompanied by a bow as graceful as that of a dancing
                        master.</p>
                    <p>"This is most extraordinary, sir," I exclaimed, "and as a friend of Colonel
                        Mandrell, as well as of his wife and daughters, I must demand of you an
                        explanation of this very unusual state of affairs."</p>
                    <p>The young man was not in the least ruffled or abashed by my vehemence, and
                        politely asked me to be seated, for I had so far remained standing.</p>
                    <p>"I can not accept courtesies from you," I said, impatiently, "which should
                        come from those who rightfully belong here. Perhaps you can tell me whether
                        any member of Colonel Mandrell's family is in the house?"</p>
                    <p>"Believe me, sir," he made answer, "I sincerely regret to tell you that
                        neither Mrs. Mandrell <pb id="VAA3892-079" n="69"/> nor either of the Misses
                        Mandrell--for I understand there are two--is present to greet you. In their
                        absence I must do the best I can, and what I lack in grace and cordiality I
                        shall endeavor to make up in other qualities which will doubtless commend me
                        to my superiors."</p>
                    <p>"Then," I said, with a feeling of danger which, though vague at first, was
                        rapidly taking definite form, "in the absence of the persons whom I came to
                        see there is nothing for me to do but to take my departure."</p>
                    <p>I turned as if to go, with the almost certain knowledge that I should not be
                        allowed to do so. To test the situation I took a step across the floor in
                        the direction of the door.</p>
                    <p>"You will pardon me, sir," said the unbidden guest in the same pleasant tones
                        that he had used from the beginning of the interview, "but a duty which I
                        owe to those who are taking an interest in Colonel Mandrell's friends while
                        he is away requires me to detain you."</p>
                    <p>It was clear to me that I was a prisoner in the house in which I had expected
                        to be welcomed in quite different fashion.</p>
                    <p>"You mean to say that I am now under arrest," I returned quietly enough but
                        in a voice hard and grating with the anger I was trying to repress. "You
                        have first driven out, or possibly imprisoned, the owner of this house and
                        his family, <pb id="VAA3892-080" n="70"/> and then hidden yourself here to
                        entrap his visitors."</p>
                    <p>"I did not say that you were under arrest," he protested, deprecatingly;
                        "what I said, was, that my duty required me to detain you. Possibly you can
                        satisfy Captain Bracken that your detention is unjust; if so, it will give
                        me great pleasure to show you to the door and bid you goodnight."</p>
                    <p>"And where may I find this Captain Bracken?" I asked, curiosity now keeping
                        company with my fears, for though I had not seen the Captain, I had heard
                        much about him from Roger Bellray.</p>
                    <p>"If you will do me the honor to follow me," said he, with unshaken
                        imperturbability, "I will take you to him at once. There is no disposition
                        to delay you longer than may be necessary."</p>
                    <p>He walked out of the room into the hall, where I saw that, as I had
                        suspected, the door was guarded by a man with a musket, who was no doubt
                        there when I entered, but concealed from my view by the heavy curtain of the
                        vestibule window. My guide led me down the corridor to a room that I
                        distinctly remembered as having been Colonel Mandrell's library.</p>
                    <p>The door was opened, and I went in in advance of my conductor. The only
                        change that I noticed in the room was in the occupant. In the place of the
                        tall form and iron-gray head of the owner of the house there was a
                        sun-browned <pb id="VAA3892-081" n="71"/> man of medium size, with a stubby,
                        dark mustache. He was possibly forty years old and had more the appearance
                        and manner of a sergeant of police than of a military man. This man was
                        sitting in an easy chair by a table and seemed to be enjoying his
                        comfortable surroundings. As I was ushered into his presence he looked up
                        keenly.</p>
                    <p>"The third one, McGrane," he said, inspecting me but addressing his
                        subordinate. "They are coming early, and quite regularly, too. Thank you,
                        lieutenant; you need not stay. Now, sir," speaking to me, "you may be
                        seated, if you wish."</p>
                    <p>"I prefer to stand until I know the nature of the business you have with me,"
                        I answered, shortly.</p>
                    <p>"As you please, of course," he returned, "but I rather like to sit down when
                        I get a chance, and that's not often in these days." He eyed me closely and
                        then added: "I don't believe I have seen you recently, Mr. Trenham."</p>
                    <p>"And I, although you have my name, have no recollection of ever having seen
                        you at all until now," I said, annoyed by his manner, "and my pleasure in
                        meeting you is one that I should willingly have foregone."</p>
                    <p>"Which proves how little we are appreciated by those upon whom we bestow even
                        our choicest attentions," he rejoined, smiling grimly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-082" n="72"/>
                    <p>Although both Lieutenant McGrane and Captain Bracken had so far treated me
                        with great civility, my position was becoming more and more unbearable.</p>
                    <p>"Captain Bracken," I demanded somewhat warmly, putting on a bold front, "I
                        desire to be informed why I, a friend of Colonel Mandrell, am thus detained
                        in his house by strangers?"</p>
                    <p>"I think it is very likely because you are a friend of the Colonel," he
                        answered. "You may or may not know that he has suddenly left his house--I
                        should judge from your conduct that you did not know until told by
                        Lieutenant McGrane--but such appears to be the fact. As to the cause of his
                        leaving, why, you may possibly have a suspicion."</p>
                    <p>As I was in a fair way at last to be enlightened I maintained silence, and he
                        went on:</p>
                    <p>"Where he is now I do not know, but should like to. He probably has not left
                        the city, for that would be a very difficult thing for him to do; and if I
                        or any of my men lay hands on him his stay here will be--well, at least
                        indefinite. Now, sir, what have you to say for yourself?"</p>
                    <p>His manner changed abruptly, and I knew he had come to the point at last.</p>
                    <p>"Of what am I accused?" I asked. "Until I know that, I can say nothing."</p>
                    <p>"That is a proper question for you to ask, and perhaps you could also answer
                        it easier <pb id="VAA3892-083" n="73"/> than I. But let me state the charge
                        this way: As Colonel Mandrell's friend by your own admission you visit his
                        house on the evening appointed for the gathering of a few friends of the
                        Confederacy, their purpose being to devise ways and means to assist General
                        Bragg in getting into the city. Such a meeting, you will acknowledge, could
                        not be overlooked by those who are interested in keeping General Bragg
                        out."</p>
                    <p>"I know nothing of this gathering," said I, truthfully. "I arrived in
                        Louisville this day, and have not seen Colonel Mandrell since--"</p>
                    <p>"Since the night of the 14th day of August," he said, interrupting me; "that
                        being a Sunday night when many good people were at church. But our friend
                        had quite a good congregation of his own, eh? Among this congregation, as
                        you will doubtless remember, were representatives from at least two
                        societies, one of them called the <hi rend="i">Corps de Belgique,</hi> or
                        some such nonsense, and the other that somewhat more extensive and not less
                        pestiferous organization with which your friend--for so I take him to
                        be--Roger Bellray, is unfortunately supposed to be too actively connected.
                        You see that I am opening my mind to you in a most unofficial way."</p>
                    <p>"Well?" said I, as he paused.</p>
                    <p>"Is that all the defense you desire to make?" he questioned.</p>
                    <p>"In all that you have said" there is yet no accusation <pb id="VAA3892-084"
                            n="74"/> against me of violating any law," I responded, "and I demand
                        that I be allowed to depart."</p>
                    <p>"You are exceedingly hard to satisfy, my young friend, and are either very
                        innocent or very deep; hang me if I know which, to be honest with you," he
                        said, showing some perplexity. "But it is my duty to send you to
                        headquarters on a charge of <hi rend="i">conspiring against the
                            government.</hi> That will suffice to detain you, for you can see how
                        impossible it is, Mr. Trenham, that you should be released tonight. Be
                        pleased to remain where you are while I call McGrane. The windows? Yes,
                        since you observe them, I may say that they are guarded. Your life will be
                        in less peril, for the present, by staying where you are."</p>
                    <p>He went out, closing the door behind him and locking it. Then something
                        happened that he plainly did not expect. I stood in my tracks until
                        satisfied that he had gone away from the door; then, losing not an instant
                        of time, I stepped softly to the side of the room where several cases filled
                        with books occupied all of the wall save a space of three or four inches
                        that for some reason had been left between them.</p>
                    <p>Stopping before the second case, counting from the left hand wall, I thrust
                        one hand between it and the next case on the right and found a groove into
                        which I inserted my fingers. Pulling stoutly, <pb id="VAA3892-085" n="75"/>
                        the case moved outward at that side until there was room enough for me to
                        get behind it. There I found a door opening into a space within as I had
                        been advised. Opening the door, I hurried through and pulled the bookcase
                        into its former position, taking pains to adjust a stout hook by which the
                        case would be held securely in place against the wall.</p>
                    <p>I was now in Stygian blackness, standing, as I knew, in a small closet built
                        between the walls. From this closet led a narrow flight of steps stopping in
                        a little passage at the bottom which had originally afforded an entrance to
                        the cellar. But more than that, it gave access to another subsurface passage
                        made of thick timbers in the long gone days when the pioneers resorted to
                        secret devices in order to escape, in a last extremity, the torch and the
                        tomahawk of the Indian.</p>
                    <p>A frontier blockhouse once stood on this spot, and from beneath it had run
                        this road to possible liberty and life. Here Colonel Mandrell's father, when
                        he came to erect the present house, had found it, and here he had allowed it
                        to remain through respect for the hardy settlers who had made it, and
                        gratitude for a service it had rendered. For it was a matter of family
                        history that by this means his own mother, among others, had found safety
                        while howling savages danced around the burning building overhead.</p>
                    <p>But while the elder Mandrell suffered the underground <pb id="VAA3892-086"
                            n="76"/> way to remain he did not leave it entirely undisturbed. It
                        pleased his somewhat eccentric fancy to connect it with that part of the new
                        house most frequented by himself--the library, --where were his books, and
                        the cellar, where was his choice store of liquors, and also with the
                        substantial stable that he had erected upon his premises for the
                        accommodation of the fine horses which, next to his family, his books and
                        his liquors, gave him his chief delight. I did not know how much it had been
                        used, but this I did know, that the cellar entrance had been bricked up and
                        effectually concealed, as had also the entrance to the lower part of the
                        stable.</p>
                    <p>Being thus secure for the time, and hidden from observation, I determined to
                        await the return to the room of my would-be captors, with the view of
                        possibly acquiring information that might be of use to me.</p>
                    <p>The man called Captain Bracken was an officer in the national secret service
                        with a wide reputation. It was known that he was keen and relentless in the
                        discharge of his duties, but it was also said of him that he need be feared
                        only by the guilty. And while I was not yet, at least, one of that class--my
                        guilt so far being limited to a purpose to join the enemies of the
                        government under which he was working--I did not want to have my plans
                        interrupted by submitting to a detention that might be prolonged.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-087" n="77"/>
                    <p>How much he really knew of me I did not care; that he knew less than he
                        professed was beyond question. On the Sunday night to which he had referred
                        I had visited Colonel Mandrell, but I had done so at the request of Bellray
                        without expectation of meeting any person other than the Colonel and his
                        family. And what is more, I had no knowledge of designs which might not be
                        honorably entertained in time of war by men whose convictions were opposed
                        to one of the parties to the contest, even though that party be the
                        Washington government.</p>
                    <p>A charge of conspiracy against that government was one, however, that I did
                        not desire to face. It was a charge now frequently made, as I had heard, and
                        many men were being held in prison to answer it, with still larger numbers
                        in this department under the surveillance of Captain Bracken and his agents.
                        It would at least serve to deprive me of my liberty for a time, and might do
                        more. As I was not a resident of the city, but had come into it when the
                        military, and not the civil, law was in force, and had at once, under cover
                        of darkness visited a known enemy of the North who was no doubt in friendly
                        communication with the invading army, my position would be compromising, if
                        not serious.</p>
                    <p>Several minutes elapsed before anybody came into the room I had just left.
                        Then I heard the voices of Bracken and McGrane lifted in exclamations <pb
                            id="VAA3892-088" n="78"/> clamations of surprise upon making the
                        discovery of my absence, both speaking at once, which rendered it difficult
                        for me to understand their precise words. A moment of bewildered silence
                        followed, during which, I suppose, they were alternately looking at each
                        other, and taking a survey of the room after the manner of human kind. Then
                        came the voice of McGrane, as suave and care-free as if the most pleasing
                        thing in the world had happened.</p>
                    <p>"Ah, Captain, our wingless bird has flown, sure enough--and such an
                        interesting bird."</p>
                    <p>"And to think, McGrane, that he came to fight if he got a chance--isn't that
                        what Tapper reported this morning? We meant to deprive him of the chance,
                        but perhaps it will come to him yet. Now, where did he get out? Look
                        sharp!"</p>
                    <p>I heard them walking about moving articles of furniture and otherwise making
                        search for the place of my egress. Presently they stopped near my hiding
                        place.</p>
                    <p>"McGrane," said the Captain, "he didn't leave by the windows, for the guard
                        is without and they are still fastened on the inside. Nor did he go through
                        these walls, which appear to be solid enough; besides, we don't have houses
                        now, adays with hidden staircases, secret passages, doors opening in
                        impossible places on touching concealed springs, and all that folderol. Old
                            <pb id="VAA3892-089" n="79"/> Mandrell is the kind of a duck who would
                        like to fool us that way, but bosh! You and I, McGrane, know a thing or two.
                        This young man went out through the door, to which doubtless he has a
                        duplicate key, and is yet somewhere in the house. Have it searched. And he
                        really wanted a chance to fight; well, he looks as if he could do it, and
                        acted so, too."</p>
                    <p>"Too bad to spoil his chance, Captain, isn't it?" McGrane said, as he left
                        the room.</p>
                    <p>It was now time for me to act, as I could accomplish nothing more by staying
                        longer.</p>
                    <p>Going noiselessly down the steps, trusting more to feeling than knowledge, I
                        carefully made my way along the passage until I came to the brick wall at
                        its end. Here, on the left, reaching out my hands, I found a stout wooden
                        door, which I succeeded in opening without any difficulty, for it was not
                        locked, and seemed to serve the single purpose of shutting off from the
                        house the drafts and damps of the outer passage into which it opened. Before
                        closing the door I paused and listened. Sounds from above came to me muffled
                        and indistinct, but they were not of a character to tell me anything
                        more.</p>
                    <p>Without waiting longer I went into the outer passage and groped along between
                        the damp wooden walls some fifty paces or more to a point where it turned
                        abruptly to the right. A little further on I stumbled upon a stairway
                        leading <pb id="VAA3892-090" n="80"/> upward. I now knew that I was near the
                        end of my underground journey.</p>
                    <p>A few steps upward brought me into contact with what proved to be a trap-door
                        which I judged to be on a level with the ground's surface. It was fastened
                        on its under side, thus showing that the secret way was last arranged for
                        use from the house alone. To loosen the door was but the work of a moment,
                        and pushing it aside I went cautiously through.</p>
                    <p>Although I had never before attempted to thread this hidden pathway I had
                        been told by Colonel Mandrell, when he made me acquainted with its
                        existence, that it could be followed without fear to the end. So, feeling
                        about me from where I stood, my hands fell upon a ladder which I at once
                        climbed until again stopped by planking overhead. Here was a second
                        trap-door which, like the other, was also fastened on the underside.</p>
                    <p>I tried the heavy bolt, but it did not yield readily. Exerting more strength
                        it finally gave way, and lifting the door a little there came an inrush of
                        fresh air laden with the grateful odor of hay. It was like incense to my
                        nostrils after breathing the foul atmosphere through which I had been
                        journeying. Through a window at the side of a spacious loft near me the
                        moonlight streamed in and enabled me to get a tolerable <pb id="VAA3892-091"
                            n="81"/> view of my surroundings, and see that there was nothing to
                        cause alarm.</p>
                    <p>Holding the trap-door only partly lifted, I listened, and, hearing no sound
                        save that made by a horse crunching hay somewhere below, I raised it and
                        stepped out into the loft. For a few moments I stood looking about me. The
                        opening by which I had entered was in one corner, and all around was
                        scattered loose hay, the great bulk of the feed being a little removed.</p>
                    <p>Stooping to close the trap I saw something shining near the top of the
                        ladder, which a closer inspection showed to be the hilt of a scabbarded
                        sword hanging on the wall of the secret chamber; near by was a pair of
                        holstered pistols. Of these I lost no time in possessing myself, for my own
                        weapons I had left in my room at the hotel and I had no intention of
                        returning there to claim them. Then replacing the door and spreading the hay
                        as it had probably been before I disturbed it so as to leave no trace of my
                        forthcoming, I made ready to go below. But I first assured myself as well as
                        I could that the stable was not watched, which being done I descended to the
                        ground floor.</p>
                    <p>I looked around for the horse that I had heard, having no fancy for walking
                        and still less disposition to take the risk of seizure involved in
                        recovering my own animal, though I regretted to <pb id="VAA3892-092" n="82"
                        /> abandon him, for I had taught him to know me and come at my call wherever
                        he might be. The horse which I was determined to take in place of it was the
                        only one remaining in the stalls, and seemed to me, as nearly as I could
                        form an opinion of it in the shadows of the stable, to be a fine one.
                        Without a moment's hesitation, but quietly, I equipped it with saddle and
                        bridle, and, again satisfying myself that the way was clear, led it out into
                        the alley.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">WITH FACE TOWARD THE SOUTH</head>
                    <p>I <hi rend="sc">DID</hi> not mount at once, but taking the horse by the bit I
                        led it some distance along the narrow alley, being careful to keep on the
                        side where the shadows of the buildings would most protect me from
                        observation. When I had in this way removed myself so far that there was no
                        longer immediate danger to be feared from those who had made so free with
                        Mandrell's house, and who had so nearly succeeded in playing a sorry joke
                        upon me, I stopped and inspected a bundle that was attached to the saddle.
                        It proved to be a long weather coat. This I shook out and put on,
                        considering myself fortunate in the discovery, for it concealed the arms of
                        which I had so summarily possessed myself, and enabled me to retain the
                        appearance of a civilian traveler, which I was not yet prepared to throw
                        aside.</p>
                    <p>Up to this time my adventure had not turned out badly, save in the matter of
                        the information of which I was deprived, and which I had intended to be the
                        guide of my further movements. I was left to my own resources, which,
                        perforce, were <pb id="VAA3892-094" n="84"/> not reassuring. In all this
                        city, filled to overflowing with citizens and soldiers, I did not know where
                        to put my hand this night upon a friend. The one thing that stood out clear
                        in my mind was that I must leave without delay and try to reach the invading
                        army, which was somewhere to the southward but how close nobody seemed to
                        know.</p>
                    <p>It was not the kind of a night that I would have preferred for my
                        undertaking, but my necessities left me no choice. And, as luck attends upon
                        audacity as often as it favors the carefully laid plans of the timorous, I
                        felt that my chances for escaping from the city were worth putting to the
                        test if boldness accompanied the trial.</p>
                    <p>Once in the saddle and astride the fine horse so providentially supplied, a
                        disposition to dare took control of me and drove out all wavering. As I rode
                        along, seeking out the quiet streets yet avoiding any appearance of stealth,
                        and pursuing a direction tending toward the southwesterly part of the city,
                        I saw and heard on all sides evidences of strain. The hour was yet
                        early--probably not more than ten o'clock. The populace, uncertain as to
                        what was in store, was all astir, and filled with excitement.</p>
                    <p>All day long troops for the defense of the city had poured in from the north;
                        these were all new levies--mostly raw and ill-equipped militia and
                        legionaries, the latter not uniformed and variously <pb id="VAA3892-095"
                            n="85"/> armed. Upon these untried men must the commandant depend to
                        assist his meager garrison in holding the expected assailants in check until
                        the disciplined soldiers of Buell, then on Bragg's heels, should come to the
                        rescue.</p>
                    <p>From my window at the hotel I had seen many of the new arrivals as they
                        straggled down the street, making a brave pretense at form but showing their
                        woeful lack of training, and in my heart I pitied them if it was to be their
                        fate to meet Bragg's old and experienced campaigners. They reminded me of
                        nothing so much as the inhabitants of a village suddenly called from their
                        beds in the middle of the night by alarm bells to subdue a threatening
                        conflagration--startled, feverish from excitement, and not knowing what to
                        do, but brave and resolute when the way was once found.</p>
                    <p>There would, it was plain, be little sleep that night in this city. Horsemen
                        passed me going in one direction or another at furious speed, as though upon
                        missions that would admit of no delay. A murmur of general unrest everywhere
                        filled the air and mingled with more specific sounds that fell upon my
                        ears.</p>
                    <p>Groups of men and women and clinging children were gathered about the doors
                        of houses, neighbor could be heard calling to neighbor, and from here and
                        there came angry voices and sounds <pb id="VAA3892-096" n="86"/> of quarrels
                        whose overheard phrases showed the cause of contention to be political.</p>
                    <p>I neared the outskirts of the city without interruption, and coming to a
                        street leading southward between rows of straggling houses toward the open
                        country that could not be far distant, I turned into it, urging my willing
                        horse to a faster pace. I had barely done so when a thick cloud obscured the
                        moon and darkened the way before me, but I pressed on.</p>
                    <p>Presently the cloud lifted and disclosed a bridge directly before me, and
                        into the added light of a street lamp near its entrance walked a sentry with
                        gun held awkwardly in hand. He called out a challenge, in obedience to which
                        I brought my horse to such a sudden stand--not being yet familiar with his
                        qualities--that he reared dangerously as the bit cut into his tender
                        mouth.</p>
                    <p>With amazement not unmixed with chagrin, I discovered in the sentry no less a
                        personage than the legionary, Spelker, who had been so quick to recognize me
                        the night before. To meet him again so soon and under such circumstances was
                        an ill fortune of which I had not dreamed. His uniform consisted of an
                        infantry cap and belt, which, along with his gun and cartridge box,
                        constituted the extent of his military accoutrement.</p>
                    <p>I fancied that he felt ill at ease in his unusual situation, and that he
                        would be happier were he well out of it and back at his horse-buying. My <pb
                            id="VAA3892-097" n="87"/> hat was down far over my face, and as I wore
                        now the long weather coat and was riding a gray horse, whereas my own was a
                        bay, I think he did not at once suspect my identity.</p>
                    <p>"What do you want?" I demanded of him sternly.</p>
                    <p>He stepped back a pace, manifesting a nervousness which, as his finger was
                        upon the trigger of a cocked musket, was somewhat disconcerting. When I
                        spoke he seemed to prick up his ears as if in recognition of my voice. As he
                        did not immediately answer my question and I felt that it would be better
                        for him to believe that I was not affecting a disguise, I rode up against
                        the very point of his bayonet and throwing back my hat renewed my demand
                        with confident front.</p>
                    <p>"So it's you, is it?" he asked, less heroically than he had accosted me on
                        the highway with a courage then stiffened by liquor and the presence of his
                        fellows, but yet with a dogged obstinacy that boded me no good. "It goes
                        against the grain to let you pass at all, my buck, but if you have the word
                        I suppose I'll have to. Give the countersign."</p>
                    <p>As far as my knowledge went the countersign might be alpha or omega, or
                        anything between, but I could not waste much time in parley, though it would
                        best suit my purpose to make the contrary appear.</p>
                    <p>"Easy, my friend, easy," said I, intent upon <pb id="VAA3892-098" n="88"/>
                        beguiling him into lowering the point of his gun. "There is plenty of time.
                        I think you treated me shabbily last night, and in very unneighborly spirit.
                        Had you ever thought that one who suspects quickly may himself be
                        suspected?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, you've got nothing to complain of, It's me that's got a very pretty
                        bump, and not your head that's cracked," he responded, dropping his musket
                        butt down, that he might have a free hand to rub his contusion. I saw my
                        opportunity, which had come much quicker than I had reason to hope.</p>
                    <p>"I am sorry," said I, as sympathetically as I could, "that I am compelled to
                        make it a pair," and thereupon flashed my sword quickly above his head and
                        let it descend flat upon the thick top of his cap.</p>
                    <p>He staggered and fell to the ground, dropping his gun as he did so, and I
                        lost no time in continuing on my way. No sound came from Spelker and if his
                        wits returned in five minutes he would do well; more serious injury he was
                        not likely to suffer.</p>
                    <p>A little beyond the bridge, at the side of the street--which here was not
                        more than a country road--I had, while talking with Spelker, observed a camp
                        fire about which men were gathered; how many I could not tell. They were no
                        doubt detailed to watch the bridge. Reasoning that as I had passed the
                        sentry they would conclude that I <pb id="VAA3892-099" n="89"/> was entitled
                        to go on, I went ahead at a smart gallp and was not stopped.</p>
                    <p>Not being at all certain as to my course, but realizing the dangers of that
                        locality, I made haste to leave it and turned into the first intersecting
                        road leading westward. Such houses as were here were mere shanties, and far
                        between, and I knew that in truth I was at the city's limits. Furthermore, I
                        knew that mounted patrols guarded every highway for miles around.</p>
                    <p>Fires at picket and vidette posts showed dully before me and to the right and
                        to the left. It would have been difficult even for one with a perfect
                        understanding of the country to get through the encircling line without
                        detection, but for me, of necessity going at a venture, how much less my
                        chance. Yet I must take it, and fortune soon favored me.</p>
                    <p>The night suddenly became intensely dark from quickly risen and threatening
                        clouds which gave promise of a storm. I prayed that the promise might be
                        speedily fulfilled, and drawing aside into a common covered with trees I
                        stopped and waited. A roll of thunder in the southwest confirmed my hopes.
                        The wind arose and began shaking down upon me the dead leaves in a shower
                        and whirling them about. A cloud of dust picked up from the dry highway
                        swept over me, filling my eyes and nostrils and grating in my teeth. Soon
                        the rain came, first in timid, uncertain <pb id="VAA3892-100" n="90"/> tain
                        waves which pattered musically upon the baked leaves, and then in a steady,
                        driving downpour.</p>
                    <p>Regaining the road I now put spurs to my horse and keeping far within the
                        circle of lights neared a road running again southward, as I could see in
                        the vivid flashes of the lightning. In the same way I saw a mounted sentry
                        cross it. He was going in the direction opposite to the one I wished to
                        take, with his head pulled down into the collar of his coat and the rim of
                        his rainsoaked hat beaten down upon his cheeks, giving him a woe-begone and
                        far from vigilant appearance. Reaching the cross-road before the soldier
                        turned back upon his beat I turned into it. The way was seemingly a mere
                        dirt road, but little traveled, I judged, already sloppy with water, and not
                        regarded as of much importance--a fact which might benefit me.</p>
                    <p>A fire that I had at first seen, apparently directly in my path, disappeared
                        under the torrents of rain, and I faced only blackness, pierced at long
                        intervals by the lightning. The noise made by the elements, while deadening
                        the sounds of my approach also made it impossible for me to hear, but I knew
                        that I must be near where the light had been.</p>
                    <p>Just then my horse swerved slightly to the left, and the sound made by his
                        rapid feet as they struck the ground showed that he was upon the <pb
                            id="VAA3892-101" n="91"/> hard smooth surface of a macadamized highway.
                        The wind was directly in my face and now swept to my ears the voices of men
                        in my front and carried behind me the sounds of my own movements. Believing
                        that I could, unless my presence was revealed by the lightning, now flashing
                        less frequently, come abreast of the men without warning, I urged my horse
                        into a run, determined to take the chances of the way before me, and like a
                        shot sped past the point where I conceived the danger to lie. Through the
                        rushing wind that filled my ears with a roar, came faintly a smothered cry
                        of alarm, a quick and futile command to halt, several shots, and then shouts
                        growing fainter. Checking my horse after awhile I listened but detected no
                        sounds of pursuit.</p>

                    <p>B<hi rend="sc">Y</hi> grace of a rare good fortune, little short of
                        accidental, I now found myself in the open country outside of the Federal
                        picket lines. There was only one thing to do and that was to go on,
                        whatsoever might befall, and go on I did. The storm passed over and the sky
                        cleared rapidly. The moon, circling high and bright in the heavens, made
                        objects plain before me save here and there where the turnpike was shadowed
                        by trees or encroaching hills. Not knowing the exact location of Bragg's
                        forces I expected every moment to come upon his outer picket line, for I had
                        no other idea than that he had control of all the approaches to the city. So
                        I was not surprised when, rounding the base of a hill skirted by the
                        turnpike, I came suddenly face to face with a party of mounted men who
                        brought me to a stand with levelled carbines. One of them, riding out a
                        little in front of the others, accosted me:</p>
                    <p>"Which way, comrade?"</p>
                    <p>"To General Bragg's army," I returned, believing these to be a part of the
                        investing force.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-103" n="93"/>
                    <p>"And where are you from?"</p>
                    <p>"Louisville," said I.</p>
                    <p>"Well," said he, "you won't be likely to reach old Bragg to-night. He's
                        flunked and turned tail for Bardstown. If you are a fighting man steer clear
                        of Bragg."</p>
                    <p>The information that General Bragg had turned back came as a great surprise
                        to me, and there was so much of anger and disappointment, as well as
                        positive disrespect toward the Confederate commander, in the speaker's tones
                        that for a moment the fear assailed me that I had stumbled upon a Federal
                        scouting party and had been too free in declaring myself. But this suspicion
                        I could hardly credit, as the leader and all of the men that I could see
                        wore the color of the Confederacy.</p>
                    <p>"And are you not Confederate soldiers?" I asked, to relieve my suspense.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, we are Johnny Rebs right enough. But we are disgusted, that's all. My
                        hundred men can't take Louisville, much as we should like to, so we are
                        going south, too. Just been taking a little rest. If you like you can ride
                        with me at the head of the column. Come on."</p>
                    <p>Getting me in front of him he turned his horse and ordered the men in the
                        road, consisting of a half dozen or more, to proceed in advance of us; then
                        gave a command that brought from the shadow of the trees on both sides of
                        the road the <pb id="VAA3892-104" n="94"/> remainder of his company, whom I
                        had not before observed.</p>
                    <p>Soon we were going southward at a good swinging trot, the leader doing me the
                        honor to ride at my side. It developed that his purpose was to have further
                        conversation with me, and he asked my name and put many other questions,
                        excusing himself on the ground that he must settle in his own mind what to
                        do with me--whether to carry me along as a prisoner or to let me follow my
                        own will. He protested that the latter course would suit him better, as he
                        did not care to bother with prisoners. I think that without being too free
                        about myself I succeeded, at least partially, in satisfying him of my good
                        faith, if not in removing all question as to my character.</p>
                    <p>He was a talkative man and had a deep-seated grievance against General Bragg,
                        at which he had already hinted, and which, with some other things, he
                        exploited in detail at intervals as we went along. It fell out that the
                        company under his command was an independent one, or a "free troop."</p>
                    <p>Aside from some voluntary contributions from friends of the South in
                        Louisville, it furnished its own equipment and subsistence, except where--
                        as was not infrequently the case, I conjectured-- they found it convenient
                        to levy tribute. He insisted that they were neither freebooters nor
                        guerrillas, but that under orders from the constituted <pb id="VAA3892-105"
                            n="95"/> authorities they undertook the accomplishment of enterprises
                        believed to be helpful to the South. A species of moss-trooper they might
                        be, he admitted with a laugh, but claimed that they denied themselves the
                        usual pleasures of brigandage while submitting to more than its customary
                        exactions and hazards.</p>
                    <p>"And yet," he said, angrily, "the Unionist commander of this district ordered
                        that we should be shot if caught, and not held as prisoners. If General
                        Bragg had been quick enough and bold enough he could have driven this
                        vaunting tyrant into the river along with all his rag-tag and bobtail, and
                        have taught him a lesson in shooting that he would have remembered."</p>
                    <p>Thus he went on, alternately railing at the Unionist district commander and
                        abusing the Confederate general, bestowing expletives in both directions
                        with an admirable impartiality. Now and again recurring to his own
                        followers, he spoke of them with pride and called them his gentlemen. He
                        seemed delighted to dwell upon the sacrifices that they were making without
                        compensation or hope of reward other than such trifles as incidentally fell
                        to their lot when they had the good luck to cut off a convoy, or were driven
                        by stress of fortune to negotiate loans from the most accessible friend or
                        foe.</p>
                    <p>I could only dimly make out what manner of man he was in appearance, but
                        otherwise could <pb id="VAA3892-106" n="96"/> form a tolerable estimate of
                        his qualities, and this, aside from the conviction that he was, perhaps, too
                        free of tongue, was not unfavorable.</p>
                    <p>Two or three hours before daybreak we came up with the scouts, no doubt at a
                        prearranged rendezvous. A halt was called, pickets thrown out and sentries
                        posted, and the men, including the leader himself, were quickly scattered
                        about on the ground sound asleep, except one stationed not far away who was
                        probably detailed to keep his eyes on me. At any rate, he very faithfully
                        did so during the remainder of the night as I can attest, for sleep
                        resolutely refused to visit me.</p>
                    <p>The camp was not astir until the sun was nearly an hour high, and thirty
                        minutes later we were again ready for the saddle. I could now see the
                        character of the company I was keeping. The leader, who had shared his
                        breakfast with me, was not greatly my senior, and was of prepossessing
                        appearance, with fair hair, a face much tanned by sun and weather, and blue
                        eyes that looked determined but not ungentle. A well proportioned man he
                        was, too, and made a fine figure on horseback.</p>
                    <p>His followers did not all impress me as having an unquestioned claim to the
                        honorable title that their commander had given them. But if boldness of
                        bearing, a rollicking humor and a proficiency in the use of oaths, to which
                        I may add, <pb id="VAA3892-107" n="97"/> from subsequent observation, good
                        horsemanship and dare-devil spirit, completed the definition of the term,
                        then they were gentlemen, every one.</p>
                    <p>They gave little heed to me. Most of them seemed not to notice my presence at
                        all. A few of them looked me over casually but maintained a strict and
                        respectful silence as to their impressions. My horse, however, appeared to
                        meet with the unqualified approval of all, judging from the looks that were
                        directed toward him and not from what was said, and he, for his part, acted
                        as if he were very well satisfied with the company he was in.</p>
                    <p>I had intentionally deferred making inquiries as to the purposes of the
                        captain with respect to myself until by some means I could make sure of my
                        standing, or until he voluntarily revealed them to me. For the time I was
                        contented that I was making some headway with my own plans, which, I felt
                        assured, were in a fair way to be ultimately realized.</p>
                    <p>Just as we were on the point of taking up our march--only waiting for the
                        return of two men who had been sent scouting in our rear--three horsemen
                        came into view on the crest of the hill behind us. Two of them were the
                        scouts but the other's identity was not disclosed until they drew near, and
                        then, to my great relief and gratification, I recognized Colonel Mandrell,
                        weary and <pb id="VAA3892-108" n="98"/> mud-spattered, and showing other
                        signs of a hard night's journey. As he came up the captain stood out to meet
                        him and friendly greetings were exchanged, proving a previous
                        acquaintance.</p>
                    <p>"Burkley, I am mighty glad to see you for I have had a regular Tam O'Shanter
                        ride this past night. Have you a flask handy? Thanks--excuse me a moment.
                        There, my boy, that will chase some of the stiffness out of my joints."</p>
                    <p>Here he looked about him, and his eyes fell upon me, comfortably astride one
                        of his favorite horses.</p>
                    <p>"Why, Trenham, how are you? How in the world did you get here?"</p>
                    <p>"Somewhat after your own fashion, I should think," I returned, "and I desire
                        to acknowledge the debt I owe to your horse, which I was compelled to
                        appropriate."</p>
                    <p>At the suggestion of Colonel Mandrell, who dismounted and stretched himself
                        at his ease on the grass in the warm sunshine, Captain Burkley delayed his
                        departure for an hour, during which time explanations were made to him by my
                        friend that brought an offer of any assistance that he might be able to
                        render.</p>
                    <p>Not only did the captain show marked respect for the new arrival, but every
                        member of the company seemed to understand that he was a person of
                        importance whose wishes as to their movements were equal to commands.
                        Indeed, <pb id="VAA3892-109" n="99"/> from the moment when Colonel Mandrell
                        had appeared among us Burkley had addressed him more as a superior officer
                        than as a chance guest, and the men gave evidence of similar regard.</p>
                    <p>At this I wondered a little, but attributed it to nothing more than simple
                        recognition of his high standing as a known and daring friend of the
                        Confederacy. When after a while we were on the Bardstown road and riding in
                        the rear of the column, as he had arranged it, he opened a conversation with
                        me that increased my wonder. First, he had told of his escape from
                        Louisville, which, having received a friendly warning of his contemplated
                        arrest, he had accomplished with difficulty after some hours of concealment
                        in the city. After I had told him about my own adventure I spoke of my
                        desire to join Morgan's cavalry. At this he exclaimed:</p>
                    <p>"Why did you not tell me of your purpose long ago? Perhaps I could have done
                        something for you." He looked at me for a moment and then added,
                        reflectively: "And perhaps I can yet. I suppose you would be satisfied with
                        anything from trooper up to major-general?"</p>
                    <p>"Anything," I made answer.</p>
                    <p>"Well, now, this is serious. Morgan wants men, as I happen to know, and
                        recruiting is being done for him even now in Kentucky. With your training
                        you ought to have a captaincy to begin <pb id="VAA3892-110" n="100"/> with,
                        but that you are not likely to get unless you can take your own company into
                        his camp."</p>
                    <p>"Which is impossible," said I, "and so I must be satisfied to go into the
                        ranks."</p>
                    <p>"I don't know that it is impossible," he responded, speaking slowly as if he
                        were turning something over in his mind. "What do you think of those
                        fellows?"--nodding his head toward the men in front of us, who sat in their
                        saddles with a negligent ease that bespoke their horsemanship.</p>
                    <p>"They look like good material," said I, not at all comprehending his meaning,
                        "and it is a pity they are not in a more regular service,"</p>
                    <p>"I have no doubt that they have served a purpose in their chosen field--in
                        truth, my information enables me to assert positively that they have--but I
                        believe that they can now be dispensed with in that line."</p>
                    <p>He stopped and again seemed to reflect. After awhile he went on: "Burkley has
                        been a good bushwhacker and has in him the making of a good officer. He is
                        loyal and faithful, but a little too eager and impatient and a trifle
                        reckless. I have heard a good deal about his company, which has been given a
                        variety of unpleasant names, and know that the Federals have been especially
                        anxious to lay violent hands on its commander." He laughed a little in a
                        grim sort of way, adding: "But Burkley has always eluded them most <pb
                            id="VAA3892-111" n="101"/> cleverly. What's the matter with your horse,
                        Trenham?"</p>
                    <p>That was what I did not know. Since we had started he had been pulling at his
                        bit and giving me trouble to hold him in check.</p>
                    <p>"Perhaps, Colonel, as he is not really mine, but yours, you can answer your
                        question better than I," said I.</p>
                    <p>He gave me a keen look and responded: "Have you tried him at the head of the
                        column?"</p>
                    <p>"That is where I rode last night, and, since you mention it, I remember that
                        he gave me no trouble at all."</p>
                    <p>"Have you ever considered the strength of habit in both man and beast?" he
                        asked. "We easily, almost unconsciously, fall into the place to which wè
                        have accustomed ourselves, and if by chance or design we are crowded into
                        another we are instantly ready for rebellion; the same thing may be true of
                        horses. But I was talking of Burkley. For some time he has been fairly
                        aching to join the artillery service. I think he told me that once, before
                        the war, he belonged to a battery which, when hostilities broke out, went
                        almost unanimously over to the Unionists. If his ambition still leads him in
                        that direction, perhaps, as I said, something can be done for you. Those men
                        there will be happy to join Morgan's <pb id="VAA3892-112" n="102"/> force,
                        and, with Burkley provided for more to his taste elsewhere, they will need a
                        new captain."</p>
                    <p>I was greatly moved by this manifest evidence of his good will and his desire
                        to help me in a way agreeable to my feelings, but far in excess of my
                        expectations, which had not been extreme. At first I was much perplexed to
                        determine how he might bring about the result which he had suggested, but
                        little by little light broke in upon my understanding and I saw the truth as
                        clearly as if he had himself explicitly narrated it.</p>
                    <p>The troop was his, maintained and used heretofore for his own purposes, or
                        purposes for which he stood sponsor, and he was its real head and leader at
                        such times as he chose to be so. He was a strong and vigorous man of
                        adventurous spirit--one who delighted in mixing action with craft, and who,
                        for powerful reasons, did not care to be publicly identified with the band
                        of irregulars ostensibly led by Larkin Burkley.</p>
                    <p>Now, by some shifting of plans, he found it convenient to sever his own
                        connection with the company and let it engage in other service. Whether he
                        had thought of the matter prior to his meeting with me this day was not
                        material, but I was certain that after it had once entered his mind he would
                        work if out for my advantage and accommodation if possible, and with him I
                        felt that it would be possible.</p>
                    <p>A little before noon we reached Bardstown, <pb id="VAA3892-113" n="103"/>
                        near which place General Bragg's army of forty thousand men was temporarily
                        encamped, and stopped on suitable ground somewhat removed from that occupied
                        by the others.</p>
                    <p>Not far from us several batteries of field artillery were stationed. They at
                        once caught and held the eyes of Burkley and set him talking at a great
                        rate, showing that his old enthusiasm had in no degree abated. Through the
                        small field glass which he carried at his side he looked the grim monsters
                        over, praising here, criticising there, and withholding judgment elsewhere.
                        He even began to speak in more friendly spirit of the Confederate commander.
                        While in this temper Colonel Mandrell took him apart and held a conversation
                        with him, the purport of which I could only guess. Afterward the two men
                        rode away together, leaving me, as the colonel told me privately, to get on
                        the best terms I could with the men.</p>
                    <p>As it happened, no better time for the realization of Burkley's ambition
                        could have been seized upon, as General Bragg, by the surrender to him of
                        the Union forces at Munfordsville a few days before, had come into
                        possession of a quantity of cannon, and his chief of artillery was even then
                        engaged in forming new batteries.</p>
                    <p>The next day Burkley announced to the troop his appointment as lieutenant of
                        artillery. He was popular with the men, and that they regretted his proposed
                        departure from among them was <pb id="VAA3892-114" n="104"/> shown by their
                        sober faces. When he had finished, Colonel Mandrell addressed them and told
                        them that the old days were over, but that a more glorious career awaited
                        them in the service of the South if they availed themselves of their
                        opportunities.</p>
                    <p>I will not attempt to set down all he said, least of all will I dwell upon
                        the overpraise that he bestowed upon me in urging upon them my fitness to be
                        their captain. But so adroitly did he appeal to them--not forgetting to
                        state that I had not pushed myself forward, and that he alone was
                        responsible for the proposal--that when he called for an expression of their
                        opinions, I was assured of their support and favor. I immediately went about
                        the task of making arrangements to carry the new scheme into execution, and
                        to that end called into consultation with me all who had acted in the
                        capacity of subordinate officers in the troop. These men I found to be happy
                        at the prospect of engaging in a more satisfactory service than that which
                        had previously occupied their time, and they exhibited a willingness to aid
                        me that drove from my mind every lingering doubt as to my welcome among
                        them.</p>
                    <p>I have thus written of these things, not because they are in themselves
                        interesting or important, but to show how it happened that I acquired rank
                        so quickly without first winning it by hard service. But that I earned it
                        afterward, in following the <pb id="VAA3892-115" n="105"/> standard of the
                        man to whose fortunes I was presently to be attached during the most
                        brilliant period of his career, and near to the time of its unfortunate
                        close, will be admitted, I think, by all of those whose dangers I shared in
                        those wild days.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">WITH THE GREAT RAIDER</head>
                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> camp at Bardstown was maintained for several days, and
                        leaving the matter to the management of Colonel Mandrell, I had the
                        satisfaction of seeing my company duly enrolled and accepted into the
                        regular service and assigned to the command of General Morgan. Its members
                        would not have been content to be placed elsewhere, and their enthusiasm and
                        delight knew no bounds when they learned that our project had been
                        successfully accomplished and that they would be soon riding up and down
                        with the great cavalier at their head.</p>
                    <p>Then there were days of delay and impatience, followed at last by a movement
                        to Harrodsburg, where came our future leader to whose fortunes we were
                        thenceforth committed. I carried to him a personal letter from the man to
                        whom I already owed so great a debt, and it was the circumstance of
                        presenting it that brought me first into the presence of this bold partisan
                        chieftain of whom I had heard so much.</p>
                    <p>He was at this time probably thirty-five years <pb id="VAA3892-117" n="107"/>
                        old, and there was that about him which at once marked him as a man of
                        distinction. A soldierly presence, in truth, with his six feet of strength
                        and grace still unmarred by the hardships to which he was constantly
                        exposed. His eyes, of a grayish blue, were lively with intelligence and
                        purpose; his features handsome, and his address as pleasing as his manners
                        were gentle and considerate. But above all else there was about him that air
                        of self-reliance, determination and utter fearlessness that characterized
                        his career as a soldier and made him renowned above his fellows for a
                        boldness and daring that, in one less capable, would have approached
                        foolhardiness. This is saying much, for the time which brought forth his
                        activities produced many resolute leaders, North and South, whose deeds have
                        made their names justly conspicuous in the history of their country. Often
                        had my youthful blood been aroused by reading of the glamorous achievements
                        of the first Richard and other heroes of chivalry, but the man I was
                        henceforth to follow was as stout of heart as any of these, though his
                        accomplishments are less famed.</p>
                    <p>The semi-independence of Morgan's command and the opportunities which it
                        afforded for adventurous service attracted to him the daring from all walks
                        of life, and in his ranks the educated sons of the high and wealthy rode
                        stirrup to stirrup with the illiterate and lowly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-118" n="108"/>
                    <p>That all those who flocked to his standard were impelled thereto by
                        patriotism I do not believe. Many were no doubt moved by a love of adventure
                        and a reckless desire to gratify it; but this I do affirm, that however it
                        chanced that a man found himself under the authority of this courageous
                        leader, he was held in fealty by a love of the man himself. For he won men's
                        hearts with singular ease, and at his word they would fight and dare and
                        die, more, I believe, for him than for the cause which he represented.</p>
                    <p>He received me at his headquarters in a most kindly manner that at once put
                        me at my ease. I looked to see him worn by the tremendous strain of a
                        recently finished campaign in which in a little over twenty days he had, to
                        the amazement of the whole country, successfully covered more than a
                        thousand perilous miles, everywhere beset by his enemies. But of this there
                        was no indication, and his freshness and elasticity of bearing gave proof of
                        his wonderful powers of endurance. This man, always eager and resourceful,
                        even to the pitiful end, never ceased to be a marvel to me.</p>
                    <p>After he had inquired concerning Colonel Mandrell he questioned me a little
                        about myself and my men, but assured me--tapping the letter with his
                        finger--that he had no misgivings about either since reading that. The
                        interview was not prolonged, as a summons came while I was present calling
                        him into council with General Bragg, but <pb id="VAA3892-119" n="109"/> as I
                        left he promised that he would' in person speedily inspect my troop. This he
                        did the next day, and from that time forth there was not a man among them
                        all who was not willing to follow him to the ends of the earth.</p>
                    <p>Scant time for rest was ever allowed this sleepless warrior, and he was soon
                        in the field again, my gallant gentlemen bearing him company. How well they
                        rode, and how well they fought, and how bravely many of them died before
                        that last headlong raid northward, need not be told.</p>
                    <p>Summer was in full tide again, when, with three thousand horsemen and a
                        battery of six guns, our faces were turned toward the Ohio. There were many
                        conjectures as to our destination and object, but aside from the General
                        himself, none knew and none questioned. Here and there as we progressed
                        small forces of the enemy fell upon our flanks or snapped at our heels.
                        These were brushed aside or driven back. On every side indications grew that
                        the Federals, aware of our movement, and knowing the intrepid character of
                        our General, were hastening the concentration of a sufficient force to bar
                        his way and thwart his purpose.</p>
                    <p>Whatever the nature of his mission, it soon became evident that he was
                        resolved to elude his foes when he could, and only fight them when they got
                        in his way. And this was often enough, God knows,. as not a day passed in
                        which the <pb id="VAA3892-120" n="110"/> charge was not sounded that sent
                        some of his men full drive against obstinate Federal guns, and stretched
                        many of our brave fellows on the ground not to rise again; among these last
                        was the General's own young brother, a lad loved by all. Nor did I escape my
                        share of the fighting, for it had long since come to be known that the once
                        irregulars never stood back where any dared go forward.</p>
                    <p>One day my company was detached from the main command with instructions to
                        feel the country to the east of our route and rejoin the column the next day
                        at Bardstown, which was for the second time to be conspicuous in my
                        itinerary. After nightfall we had, on information obtained from a friendly
                        citizen, surprised and captured the Federal Colonel Crespy at the moment
                        when he was enjoying a much relished dinner at the house of a Unionist
                        situated on the outskirts of a town in which his regiment of cavalry had
                        been halted for the night.</p>
                    <p>His escort, which he had left on guard about the premises, had unfortunately
                        escaped into the town, thus making it necessary for us to hasten from the
                        locality unless we cared to measure our strength against vastly superior
                        numbers. Guided by the same citizen we had ridden far into the night,
                        bearing gradually toward the place of the morrow's rendezvous. It lacked
                        only a few hours of daylight when I considered it safe to stop and <pb
                            id="VAA3892-121" n="111"/> dispose my weary but uncomplaining troopers
                        for a little rest. As for myself, I had barely touched the ground before I
                        was sound asleep.</p>
                    <p>My next conscious sensation was one of being shaken violently, and the
                        shaking, as I have always since believed, was supplemented by a kick, still
                        more potential in opening my heavy eyes. Aroused and startled, and not a
                        little ruffled by the latter indignity--though I quieted my feelings by
                        thinking that it was not intended as such, but born of the fancied urgency
                        of the situation--I jumped to my feet, thoroughly awake, to find that every
                        man was up and standing to horse in the early morning sun ready to take my
                        commands. Before me stood Neffitt, the corporal of the guard, a good
                        soldier, but a wild fellow with little reverence for rank save in his
                        obedience to orders. He saluted, but I detected a mischievous twinkle in his
                        eyes which confirmed my suspicion as to his manner of getting me up.</p>
                    <p>"What's the trouble?" I demanded sharply, showing my disapproval.</p>
                    <p>"The enemy, coming over the hill," he said, saluting again, this time more
                        seriously and pointing toward the east.</p>
                    <p>Looking that way I saw a group of bluecoated horsemen coming down the decline
                        Without a doubt they were the advance guard of Crespy's cavalry, now close
                        on our heels. My men occupied an elevated position in an open wood a little
                            <pb id="VAA3892-122" n="112"/> off the road, but near the edge of the
                        wood there was enough underbrush to make it unlikely that we had been yet
                        observed. The hill was nearly a mile away, and between us stretched level
                        ground only broken on the south of the road by a long ridge.</p>
                    <p>I determined to wait and make sure as to the numbers of the Federals. Colonel
                        Crespy himself stood near, outwardly calm and unmoved, but in his eyes there
                        was unmistakable trace of inward excitement. The moment was an anxious one,
                        not less for him than for us all. At close quarters my men, numbering less
                        than one hundred, would have small chance against my prisoner's whole
                        regiment of eight hundred which I believed to be coming upon me.</p>
                    <p>I was resolved not to risk the hazards of a combat if my surmises as to the
                        strength of my opponents proved to be correct. Of this fact I was not long
                        in doubt, for presently the head of a column appeared on the hill top, and I
                        was on the point of ordering my men into the road for a race when my eyes
                        fell upon a sight that caused me to withhold the command.</p>
                    <p>About one-third of the distance between my position and the Federals was a
                        road, which, coming from the north, crossed the other at right angles and
                        disappeared into a small wooded valley two or three hundred yards or so
                        beyond. The elevation constituting the eastern slope of <pb id="VAA3892-123"
                            n="113"/> the little valley extended farther toward the crossing of the
                        roads than did the western, thus allowing us to see persons traveling the
                        valley road northward before they became visible to our enemy.</p>
                    <p>Emerging upon this road were horsemen in gray clothes going at a smart trot.
                        My glass showed them to belong to Morgan's command, but how many of them I
                        could not yet tell, as the General had a habit of dividing his force in
                        sweeping through the enemy's country and reuniting it at points agreed upon,
                        always being in personal command of the column with which he rode.</p>
                    <p>Before I could possibly have given warning to my comrades of the near
                        presence of the Federals, the advance guards of the forces were face to
                        face. Unslinging their carbines they fired and fell back, while the main
                        column of Federals broke into a gallop, and at the same time file upon file
                        of gray coats came charging up from the southward.</p>
                    <p>Without waiting to see more, I detached two men to guard Colonel Crespy,
                        whose cheeks were now aflush with feeling, and placing myself at the head of
                        my eager men shouted a command that took us into the highway and started us
                        flying forward.</p>
                    <p>The Confederate leader was, I saw with keen <pb id="VAA3892-124" n="114"/>
                        satisfaction, Morgan himself, and he appeared to take in the situation in
                        which he was placed at a glance. A quick maneuvering of his force showed
                        that he was preparing for a struggle; and it was the kind of a fight that he
                        liked, in the open, with plenty of room for men and horses.</p>
                    <p>The Federals, on their part, did not wait to see whether the enemy fronting
                        them consisted of a few or many, but came onward with great dash and
                        courage, deploying a column to the right and to the left with incredible
                        rapidity and skill. It seemed to me at the moment--though I had little time
                        to study the strategical qualities of the field --that the lay of the ground
                        was favorable to the Confederates, and so it should have been, seeing that
                        our General's following was made up of only four or five troops and was not
                        much better than a scouting party. The elevation to the east, which extended
                        well out toward the highway, protected them in a measure against attack on
                        the flank, I thought, thus giving them an opportunity to strike the enemy's
                        center to greater advantage, with little to fear from a counter side
                        blow.</p>
                    <p>That was the way it looked to me, but the General took no chances. Deploying
                        his whole force quickly well back in the field beyond the angle of the
                        roads, he arranged it so that he could get headway from whatever direction
                        he was likely to be assailed. It was well that he did, for presently, almost
                        abreast of their comrades on the <pb id="VAA3892-125" n="115"/> low ground
                        and in the highway, there came a rush of horse over the brow of the ridge.
                        The roads were only unimproved ways worn by travel across the unfenced
                        ground, and furnished no obstruction to the movements of the cavalry.</p>
                    <p>It was my intention to take care of that part of the enemy--which did not
                        greatly outnumber my command--to the north of the main road and prevent them
                        from falling upon the General's flank. To that end I swerved to the left,
                        straightened out in column of eights, then dashed at speed toward the noses
                        of their horses.</p>
                    <p>Before reaching them I took a glance at the other part of the field and saw
                        that every shod hoof was in motion and beating the earth in unison with its
                        fellows to the right and to the left, before and behind. The General was a
                        good hundred yards ahead of me, and almost upon the foe who had been
                        compelled to turn slightly to face him. A hundred feet--fifty! God! how my
                        blood tingled and how my muscles drew under the double strain--often as
                        similar scenes had spread before my eyes--until I felt that I was being
                        fairly pulled from my saddle. And then the combatants crashed into each
                        other's very teeth.</p>
                    <p>I caught a ghmpse of rearing horses and flashing sabers, and heard the rattle
                        of revolver shots and the shouts of the fighters. It was only a glimpse, for
                        in a moment I was myself striking <pb id="VAA3892-126" n="116"/> out
                        lustily, and about me was a confusion of blue and gray coats, a struggling
                        mass of speaking and dumb animals, a clashing of metal, and hoarse words of
                        defiance.</p>
                    <p>Just as I began to feel that I was safely through our adversary's line, my
                        horse stumbled beneath me and went down in spite of my efforts to get it to
                        its feet, and over and around me flashed the trampling heels of my
                        followers' horses as they thundered by with rattling scabbards and clanking
                        harness. It was one of the fortunes of war and I expected to be crushed
                        where I lay, but they passed by leaving me untouched.</p>
                    <p>I had risen to my feet when a bearded young Federal officer, wearing the
                        straps of a lieutenant, who had been unhorsed in the charge, came running up
                        and with drawn sword demanded my surrender. My own blade was still in my
                        hand, and presenting it I demanded that he himself should yield. Instantly
                        we were fighting as though the issue of the battle depended upon the
                        strength of our arms. Presently my opponent, who had exhibited a skill not
                        anticipated by me, called out my name in a loud tone of surprise and
                        withheld his hand. Taking it that he desired to yield, although he was far
                        from being overcome, and being surprised that he knew me, I also withheld my
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>Before either had time to speak a horseman dashed up and aimed a blow at the
                        officer with <pb id="VAA3892-127" n="117"/> his saber. I thrust out my sword
                        just in time to turn the weapon aside, and looking up saw that it was my
                        unceremonious corporal. Without waiting to hear the rebuke that was rolling
                        hot from my lips, he jumped down, and, with a salute, exclaimed:</p>
                    <p>"They are forming for the return charge; take my horse, sir," and then the
                        rascal, pushing the rein into my hand, scampered off after a loose animal
                        that was standing, bewildered and snorting, a little distance away.</p>
                    <p>"Thank you, Captain Trenham. My beard has grown, but your old friend, Paul
                        Venault, salutes you."</p>
                    <p>With that he started after the corporal, for the horse was no doubt his. My
                        astonishment was so great that I could not utter a word, nor indeed did I
                        have time, for, as the corporal had said, my men had checked up a couple of
                        hundred yards further on and had already faced about.</p>
                    <p>Spurring toward them I looked to see how our comrades were faring south of
                        the road, and saw the tall form of the General at the head of his column
                        ready for another blow. And while I watched, that column started back,
                        compact and steady, and like a human wedge it drove itself into and through
                        the line of the enemy. At the very front, as the keen edge of the wedge rode
                        the General himself as it plunged into the moving <pb id="VAA3892-128"
                            n="118"/> mass of blue and cleft its way where resistance seemed the
                        most determined.</p>
                    <p>On rejoining my men I looked back to see what my late opponents were doing,
                        and observed that they seemed to be in doubt as to their further course.
                        While they wavered it occurred to me to get into the greater fight where I
                        thought I saw a chance to achieve a more conclusive result. Scarce a hundred
                        yards lay between my present position and the main body of the enemy, now
                        already in confusion, and I had it in mind to follow my General. But this we
                        were not allowed to do, for our opponents suddenly started toward us like
                        mad.</p>
                    <p>So, giving the command, we set out to meet them in a final struggle for the
                        mastery. Gathering quick speed, with sabers gripped firmly and feet well
                        stirruped for the shock, we went hammering back over the green turf. Cheers
                        broke from the throats of Burkley's gentlemen as we struck the foe,
                        hesitated, then grappled for an instant, while the morning sun glinted from
                        rising and falling blades.</p>
                    <p>A participant sees few things clearly in a charge of cavalry against cavalry.
                        It means action, motion, set jaws, flaming eyes, the curses of the reckless,
                        and uproar indescribable. So it was in this fierce onset, now so stubbornly
                        resisted. A glancing blow upon the shoulder nearly unseated me once, but the
                        charge wore itself out at last and <pb id="VAA3892-129" n="119"/> the
                        contestants tore themselves apart piecemeal and roared onward like a
                        rock-broken torrent.</p>
                    <p>Many riderless horses galloped about the field, confused, and with heads held
                        high in frightened liberty. A noble bay which went neighing by near me bore
                        such a striking resemblance to the animal I had been compelled to abandon at
                        Louisville that I shouted its name, whereat it stopped suddenly as if in
                        doubt. Again I called and it came bounding to my side and followed me along.
                        Its superior trappings showed that it had been ridden by an officer. Turning
                        in my saddle I saw that the Federals were withdrawing, for the time
                        seemingly demoralized, and I wondered if the result would have been
                        different had the gallant Crespy been at their head, and thought of the pain
                        in his soldier heart as he watched the fight going against them.</p>
                    <p>But this was not all that I saw. Across the field on foot came my corporal
                        bearing along with him as a prisoner the luckless Venault, who was limping
                        dreadfully and looked chagrined and dispirited. I learned afterward that in
                        running after the corporal he had become entangled with his scabbard and
                        fallen, wrenching his knee and breaking his sword. He had then become the
                        easy victim of his foe, who thenceforward devoted his time to bringing him
                        into our lines.</p>
                    <p>Venault's misfortune upset him sadly, and the humiliation of it seemed to
                        grind him more <pb id="VAA3892-130" n="120"/> than his injury, though the
                        agony caused by the wrenched ligaments must have been very great. He had
                        been in the Federal army almost a year, he told me. His restless spirit
                        craved excitement, and, as his own country was at peace, he had followed the
                        example of the Count of Paris and come to America. Enlisting the good
                        offices of the French minister, he got a commission after a time, and had
                        seen a good deal of hard service.</p>
                    <p>"Well done, Captain Trenham," called out the General, as I neared the spot
                        where he was resting his panting horses. "That finished them, I think, but I
                        believe we had better not tie ourselves here."</p>
                    <p>Praise from the General was always generous when deserved, and strengthened
                        the attachment of his followers. But it was never recklessly bestowed, and
                        there was honest striving for his approval. It was not the first time that
                        good fortune had brought me to his attention and elicited commendation. Our
                        good services had been pledged in advance and we had felt obliged on every
                        occasion to do our best, which, I may assert, we would have done had no
                        pledge been given.</p>
                    <p>After a few minutes our march was resumed on the westward road, and we picked
                        up my two men and Colonel Crespy on the way. An hour's travel brought us to
                        the Bardstown turnpike, and about eleven o'clock we appeared before that
                        town to <pb id="VAA3892-131" n="121"/> find that a small force there was
                        hotly resisting the entrance of our comrades who had arrived on the evening
                        before. The General was informed of the situation; how the Federals,
                        consisting, as we afterward learned, of a single troop, stationed in a
                        building commanding the principal street, had held off a portion of his
                        command for the better part of a day, were still unconquered and stubbornly
                        refused to surrender. Then it was that, for the first and last time, I saw
                        our leader furious with anger and impatience.</p>
                    <p>"Great God! sir," he exclaimed to the senior officer, who had all forenoon
                        worried over the problem of how to dislodge the foe without yet being able
                        to solve it, "do you mean to spend the summer here? We shall have all the
                        Unionists in the Kentucky department about our ears at this rate. Get your
                        guns in position, send another flag and then if they do not surrender shell
                        them out. It is well enough to be brave, but they need not be fools."</p>
                    <p>After that the affair came to an end as quickly as could be desired even by
                        the General himself, for when the little band of defenders saw that cannon
                        were trained upon their improvised fortress at a range that would tear the
                        building to pieces and them along with it they laid down their arms and came
                        out. The General, his wrath appeased, complimented their courage and let
                        them go upon their paroles, releasing at the same time and in <pb
                            id="VAA3892-132" n="122"/> the same way Colonel Crespy and my friend
                        Paul. I never saw the latter afterward, but in that dreadful war between his
                        own country and Prussia a few years later he was a colonel of hussars, and
                        was killed while leading a charge at Gravelotte.</p>
                    <p>We had enough to bother us without carrying along a lot of prisoners to
                        hamper our movements. Our scouts were constantly bringing in reports of the
                        tremendous activities of the Federals, whom Morgan was doing all in his
                        power to mislead. For that purpose he had heretofore divided his force, and
                        for that purpose, also, he had, through his private operator, tapped the
                        telegraph wires in secluded places, and intercepted the enemy's messages,
                        thus learning many of the things that were being proposed and done to
                        circumvent him. And there are grave reasons for doubting the authenticity as
                        well as the accuracy of answers to some of these messages that were sent
                        flying back to the Unionist headquarters.</p>
                    <p>There may be those who do not admit the justness of strategy such as this.
                        But in the matter of military diplomacy I have always observed that the
                        principal thing is to win, and that one who is determined to follow strictly
                        moral and straightforward lines in all relations has no business at the head
                        of an army situated as ours was.</p>
                    <p>Not a man among us doubted the ability of our General to extricate himself
                        from the difficulties that were being thrown around him. The <pb
                            id="VAA3892-133" n="123"/> word had been given, as we all knew, that his
                        command should be pursued to the last ditch and destroyed. But he had
                        hitherto avoided so many traps and fought his way through so much opposition
                        that his men had come to believe in his invincibility, and were eager to
                        follow him anywhere. That he believed thus strongly in himself I will not
                        affirm, but I do declare the fact--for fact it is--that he was undaunted to
                        the end.</p>

                    <p>We had been without knowledge as to our destination, our duty being only to
                        follow and obey. It was rumored among the men--who sometimes guessed closely
                        to the truth--and believed by some of the officers, that General Morgan had
                        set out to accomplish at Louisville a part of what General Bragg had failed
                        to do in the previous year. There was talk that the city was poorly
                        garrisoned, which, if true, was no doubt because it was not thought that any
                        Confederate commander would be so audacious as to undertake its seizure. To
                        do so, it would be necessary to traverse more than two hundred miles of
                        country then in possession of the Unionists.</p>
                    <p>But if that had really been our General's object --as I am now certain that
                        it was not, whatever his orders may have been from his superiors--he had at
                        least temporarily abandoned it, for we had <pb id="VAA3892-135" n="125"/>
                        borne off to the westward, and were now more than two score miles below that
                        city. There were not wanting among the officers some who believed that he
                        was following a plan of his own. Just what it was had caused a great deal of
                        conjecture, since the original surmises had to be discarded.</p>
                    <p>All knew that the armies of Bragg and Buck-ner were dangerously beset by the
                        Federal forces, which were gradually tightening the lines about them, and
                        that unless these lines could be loosened by some astounding diversion they
                        were likely to be speedily overwhelmed. If that were actually the General's
                        purpose, it had been successful thus far, as important bodies of soldiery
                        had been withdrawn from other affairs and set upon our track.</p>
                    <p>We had ridden like the wind for two weeks, every day of which we had been
                        compelled either to dodge or fight as best suited the mood of our commander,
                        for he could be as discreet as any when he chose, and also as rash as any. I
                        have said before that he eluded the enemy when he could, but it must not be
                        understood that he ever relinquished a path that he seriously desired to
                        pursue without a contest for the right of way.</p>
                    <p>And now Brandenburg, with the Ohio river in a fog at our feet! Are we to turn
                        back or go on? If to go on, what is there for us beyond the fog?</p>
                    <p>We are to cross, so the order has been given. <pb id="VAA3892-136" n="126"/>
                        To that end the troops of Captains Taylor and Merriwether had been sent
                        pellmell in advance of us the day previous to look after ferriage. By good
                        fortune two large steamboats had fallen easily into their hands and these
                        were now at the wharf ready to carry us over.</p>
                    <p>We had been in the saddle since midnight, with only a few hours' rest before,
                        but these were iron men and they showed little sign of weariness. They
                        laughed and seemed happy. Most of them were young and full of the fire and
                        daring of youth, fit followers for such a leader. No enterprise to which he
                        could put his hand would be too desperate to suit them, and the more
                        reckless it seemed that much more was it likely to stir their enthusiasm and
                        entice them onward. They asked only to know his will.</p>
                    <p>As they looked down from the heights to the river and across it toward the
                        Indiana border, now faintly visible through the slowly lifting fog, they
                        were filled with an almost childish joy and eagerness. In truth it was a
                        fair and rich field, unswept by war. No hostile army had trod its soil or
                        disturbed the tranquillity of its inhabitants.</p>
                    <p>The General, sitting his horse a little way off, did not appear to be less
                        sanguine and eager than his men. What thoughts were in his mind as he looked
                        at that inviting shore line through the dissolving mist? Did he think of
                        easy conquest or of the amazing sensation that he was about to <pb
                            id="VAA3892-137" n="127"/> cause? A smile rested upon his strong,
                        sun-bronzed face as he watched his men making ready for a journey that was
                        destined to try their very souls. While he paused thus, now and then
                        exchanging words with Colonel Duke, a shrewd officer for whom he had the
                        highest regard, and who just now did not seem to be in a very good humor, a
                        man walked up and saluted.</p>
                    <p>"Why, it is Captain Hines," exclaimed Duke. "So it is," said the General,
                        "and I am glad to see you, Captain. Where is your company?"</p>
                    <p>"Here," said the officre--though at that moment he looked little like
                        one--striking himself on the breast, a grim smile playing about his resolute
                        mouth.</p>
                    <p>"But your men, sir," persisted the General. "There," returned the captain,
                        pointing toward the river and then at the green shore beyond. "Some of them
                        were captured and some of them were drowned, like the brave fellows they
                        were, in trying to get out of that hornet's nest. I report for duty,
                        General. My experience over there has not been to my liking, but I am ready
                        to go back."</p>
                    <p>The commander's face clouded. "It will do no good to complain of the loss of
                        so many good men, even though they are needed badly," he said, with a motion
                        of his hand as if he were throwing the whole matter aside, "but I do not
                        understand how you happened to be there."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-138" n="128"/>
                    <p>"I was given permission to operate north of the Cumberland, General."</p>
                    <p>"So you were; but heavens, man, did you construe your orders to authorize you
                        to invade a hostile state with your single troop? The next time I send a
                        corporal out with a squad I shall expect to hear of him marching on to
                        Washington with a demand for its surrender in his mouth ready framed. But
                        never mind, Hines; you are a man after my own heart, and gave them a merry
                        dance, I'll be bound."</p>
                    <p>"Indeed I did, sir, and they gave me a merrier. I thought I might be able to
                        stir up the copperheads, but the legionaries allowed me no time for any such
                        diplomatic diversion."</p>
                    <p>They moved away presently, the General and Colonel Duke going down to the
                        landing while Captain Hines started off to look up the quartermaster to whom
                        he was directed to report his need of equipment. The latter stopped long
                        enough by my side to give me a shake of the hand and to hear my hearty
                        expression of satisfaction at his personal safety, then went on, waving his
                        hand right and left in salutation and exchanging greetings with his
                        comrades.</p>
                    <p>For this man was as chivalrous a soul as ever bestrode a horse, and the
                        ill-success of his bit of knight-errantry was not counted against him when
                        it became known how gallantly he had borne himself. With the enemy in
                        overwhelming numbers <pb id="VAA3892-139" n="129"/> pressing upon him he had
                        taken to the water, and with a remnant of his company had succeeded in
                        reaching an island. Beyond this the channel was swift and deep and was
                        patrolled by a gunboat that inflicted great damage. Yet he boldly plunged
                        in, and with two men out of the sixty who had followed him got safely to the
                        more friendly southern shore, where be became separated from the others and
                        by mere chance was enabled to rejoin our forces at the moment of our
                        embarkation for the scene of his disaster.</p>
                    <p>Probably I alone of all the adventurous band about me--so eager to reach the
                        coveted land and so careless of the consequences of a project so
                        daring--looked with dismay and regret upon the prospect that confronted us.
                        I drew a little apart from the others while awaiting orders, but did not
                        dismount, and gazed northward with a heavy heart. Less than a score of miles
                        away, over the green hills, I saw, in my fancy, a little valley in which
                        were two houses that held those who were dearest to me in life--my mother,
                        and that other one, who, though neither kith nor kin, still filled my
                        soul.</p>
                    <p>It was months since I had last looked upon that peaceful scene--months of
                        danger, of foray and battle, of victory and defeat, of wild charges and
                        precipitate retreats. I had become, to all outward seeming, much as the
                        other men, reveling in peril <pb id="VAA3892-140" n="130"/> and dare-devil
                        divertisement, yet often in the thick of conflict staying my uplifted sword
                        as there would flash before my mental vision the fair face and appealing
                        eyes of her who, I felt sure, desired my welfare but prayed for the defeat
                        of my cause. Not that I shirked my duty as I had undertaken to perform
                        it--God forbid that my manhood should be open to a suspicion so
                        recreant!--but at such times, in spite of myself, my will would fail and my
                        muscles lose their tension. And even now I would have turned back these
                        invaders had the power been mine and breasted them against the thousands
                        thundering behind us. But I could neither do that nor withdraw myself from
                        participation in the raid.</p>
                    <p>So much for a sentiment which I am not ashamed to avow, and if it be
                        considered evidence of weakness, then I was weak. I am not criticising any
                        one, General Morgan least of all. This was war and he was a soldier, and
                        none more gallant ever lived, to my mind. The Northland was not more sacred
                        than the not less fair fields of the South. And this man, called marauder,
                        guerrilla and bandit by the hasty and inconsiderate, after all pursued his
                        ill-starred way with a moderation that gave the lie to his accusers and
                        marked him a knightly cavalier.</p>
                    <p>While I remained thus, burdened with my reflections, a man, who, judging from
                        his dress, was neither officer nor private, came toward me <pb
                            id="VAA3892-141" n="131"/> on foot. He was in appearance near thirty
                        years of age, fair and little weather-stained, in the latter respect
                        contrasting strongly with the rough riders through whom he had made his way.
                        He was of good figure and handsome features, but bore a countenance
                        unmistakably sinister in its expression. A certain sort of courage seemed to
                        shine from his light blue eyes, yet there was something unsteady and
                        shifting in the manner of his gaze that seemed to give warning of
                        insincerity, if not of downright treachery. I did not particularly note
                        these things at the time, for I barely observed him until he spoke.</p>
                    <p>"Well, Captain Trenham, what do you think of the prospect?" he said
                        familiarly, a disagreeable smile curling his lips.</p>
                    <p>I turned my head and looked at him fairly; looked, but did not answer at
                        once, for I could not recognize in my questioner an acquaintance, or in
                        truth one that I had seen before. When I did speak, it was to say
                        sharply--for the manner of his interruption nettled me:</p>
                    <p>"You have my name, sir, but I have not yours."</p>
                    <p>"A name is of little consequence these days, and sits lightly on many men,"
                        he returned, unruffled. "I am not always particular as to my own, but since
                        you suggest it, I give the name of Dallas Vawter, which, as it happens, is
                        the one that my parents gave to me."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-142" n="132"/>
                    <p>"And why is my opinion important to you, Mr. Vawter? Why don't you question
                        the General as to what he thinks?" I asked with scant courtesy. I felt an
                        instinctive dislike of this stranger, who, for some cause, had picked me out
                        as a target for his tongue.</p>
                    <p>"You are abrupt, Mr. Captain, but I do not mind answering your query if you
                        are not disposed to answer mine," Vawter said with a sneer. "As you formerly
                        lived in the neighborhood of Corydon, which place no doubt you will
                        presently see, I thought that you might be peculiarly interested."</p>
                    <p>"You seem to have put yourself out to learn my history, sir," I responded, my
                        curiosity awakening in spite of me, for I had entered the service of the
                        South as from Virginia, and so far as I was aware not a man, from the
                        General down, knew that I had ever resided elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>"Not at all, I assure you, Captain," he said with an irritating half laugh
                        intended to discomfort me, for he was quick enough to see that he had made
                        an impression and meant to strengthen it. "I have recently been a resident
                        of that delightful locality and heard somewhat of one John Trenham who went
                        off to join the rebels. So keen was he to show his prowess that he engaged a
                        party of the legionaries on the highway before he had fairly warmed his
                        saddle. Oh, it was no trouble to hear of you if one were inclined <pb
                            id="VAA3892-143" n="133"/> to listen. You will be received with
                        befitting hospitality if by chance they learn that you are with General
                        Morgan. If you were a stranger like these others you would fare better, I
                        think."</p>
                    <p>"If you are a resident of Corydon, how does it come that you are here?" I
                        inquired suspiciously, overlooking his offensive tone.</p>
                    <p>"I might retort by putting the same interrogatory to you, but I will not. A
                        residence is like a name--it may be changed as one's convenience or
                        necessities demands. Your General has done me the honor to accept my
                        services in a capacity that may be useful to him in the first stages of his
                        expedition. I joined you at Garnettsville last night. I am a man of peace,
                        you understand," he went on with a leer, "but I do not object to doing a
                        little thing like this for my friends. I am a Kentuckian, like most of these
                        sturdy fellows about us, but not given to turmoil, so I moved across the
                        river. It is more quiet over there."</p>
                    <p>"To be plain about it," said I, bluntly, "it is your trade to betray and not
                        to fight."</p>
                    <p>His face reddened and he flashed upward an ugly look. "That is putting the
                        case rather baldly, sir," he cried, with heat, moving a step or two further
                        away; "but you yourself have heard that all is fair in love and war, and I
                        now desire a slight taste of the latter since I have so lately succeeded in
                        the other field; and I pledge you my <pb id="VAA3892-144" n="134"/> word
                        that the fair Kate Bellray is well worth the winning, rank Unionist though
                        she is."</p>
                    <p>With one bound of my horse I was by his side, and leaning over the saddle
                        horn I seized him by the collar.</p>
                    <p>"Scoundrel!" said I, fiercely, not accustomed to being played with, and
                        believing that the man was lying in his teeth. "Speak that lady's name again
                        in my presence and I will wring your slanderous neck," and I flung him from
                        me with such violence that he was sent rolling upon the ground.</p>
                    <p>He got up white with passion. "Oho! I was not mistaken in guessing which way
                        the wind blows with you," he cried, glaring at me wickedly. "May the devil
                        be a saint if I don't make you pay dearly for this pleasantry of yours,
                        Master Trenham!"</p>
                    <p>And then muttering to himself in his fury he turned and walked toward the
                        river, brushing the dust from his clothes and feeling of his bruised neck as
                        he went. No time was allowed me to entertain disquieting thoughts concerning
                        this man who had taken such pains to hunt me out and make himself
                        obnoxious--getting the worst of the transaction, however, as I viewed it. A
                        serious present business now claimed my attention.</p>
                    <p>"Boom!" The fog had already cleared away and on the far side of the
                        river--here more than half a mile wide--rose a great puff of white <pb
                            id="VAA3892-145" n="135"/> smoke. It was the challenge of the
                        legionaries. Instantly afterward the men on one of the steamers began to
                        disembark hurriedly. A solid shot had carried away part of the vessel's
                        smokestack.</p>
                    <p>"Boom!" There was another puff of smoke on the Indiana shore, and another
                        shot caused a hasty evacuation of the wharf. A third and a fourth followed,
                        and the cavalry then on the river front fell further back, laughing and
                        chattering among themselves with an abandon that showed how little they
                        recked of danger.</p>
                    <p>Presently from the Brandenburg heights there was a flash and a roar, as our
                        guns answered the seemingly solitary but audacious cannon opposite. Another
                        discharge, and then the little force of rural artillerymen who had sought to
                        sweep back the tide of invasion was seen to withdraw quickly into the
                        interior, whereupon the commander of the battery turned his attention to a
                        company of legionaries that had been posted along the bank to resist our
                        passage, and soon sent them flying after their artillery.</p>
                    <p>The way now being open, a part of the troops, leaving their horses behind,
                        were sent across the river to prevent further interruptions from the
                        shore.</p>
                    <p>But we were not to be allowed to effect a passage until a new and greater
                        difficulty was overcome. Hardly had the detachment accomplished a landing
                        when a Federal gunboat came rapidly <pb id="VAA3892-146" n="136"/> down the
                        river and began firing with all its might and main, first at the enemy on
                        one side and then at the force on the other. The guns on the heights
                        answered shot for shot. The duel continued for an hour, when the boat
                        withdrew from the unavailing combat and steamed away again as quickly as it
                        had come.</p>
                    <p>The work of crossing was resumed with all haste, but before it was finished
                        the gunboat reappeared with two transports loaded with troops and mounting
                        guns. Again there was much fruitless cannonading and again did the foe
                        depart, leaving us to our devices. The transferring of all the remaining men
                        and horses was carried on without further hindrance.</p>
                    <p>By six o'clock in the evening the last man and the last gun had left the
                        Kentucky shore, and the vessels that had so well served our purpose were
                        destroyed in order that they might not perform a like duty for the army that
                        was pursuing us with grim and unflagging determination, as our General very
                        well knew.</p>
                    <p>Marching a few miles inland, orders were given to encamp for the night. On
                        all sides the frightened inhabitants had fled from their homes, taking
                        refuge in such places of concealment as they could find as if they held us
                        to be common cutthroats; and indeed I have no doubt that many of them did
                        honestly so hold us, seeing that the character of these valorous men had
                        been <pb id="VAA3892-147" n="137"/> grossly misunderstood and defamed. That
                        there were appropriations of private property for which our General was
                        unable to make adequate recompense, I can not deny; but it will now be
                        admitted, even by those who were then his opposers, that, having the power
                        to do so much, the fact that he did so little that was unjustified by the
                        rules of war, proves that he essayed to limit his purveyors as far as he was
                        able to the necessities of his command.</p>
                    <p>The war-beaten districts to which we had been accustomed were desert wastes
                        compared with the untouched country into which we had now come, and the
                        abundance surrounding them, added to the knowledge that they were in the
                        enemy's country, sufficed to persuade many of our thoughtless fellows to
                        regard looting for sustenance as a virtue. Thus it happened that undefended
                        household stores fell as easy and much-relished spoils into their hands;
                        thence speedily into their not over-filled stomachs.</p>
                    <p>It was yet early in the night--probably an hour after darkness had
                        fallen--when an orderly from headquarters brought to me a message commanding
                        my presence before the General. I went at once and found him alone, busy
                        with a map that was spread out before him. As I entered he looked up, then,
                        seeing who it was, said without any preliminaries: <pb id="VAA3892-148"
                            n="138"/> "Captain Trenham, I am told that you are familiar with this
                        country."</p>
                    <p>"Not familiar with it, sir, but somewhat acquainted with it," I responded,
                        knowing well the source of his information.</p>
                    <p>"How does it happen that you have not yourself told me of the fact of your
                        former residence here?" he asked, but not unkindly.</p>
                    <p>"I leave you to judge if my silence has affected my qualities as a soldier,"
                        said I. "Not until this morning did I certainly know you were coming here,
                        and since then I have had no convenient opportunity, though I should have
                        told you this night in any event."</p>
                    <p>"I know your worth and appreciate your services, Captain Trenham, but it is
                        possible that you might have given me information that would have aided my
                        plans had I known. However, it is time enough. I have been told by one
                        Vawter--"</p>
                    <p>"Pardon me, sir, but the man is plainly a rascal," said I, unable to restrain
                        my tongue, which ordinarily was discreet enough.</p>
                    <p>The General laughed. "No doubt he is all that and more; but he tells me that
                        you have a much better knowledge of this country than he has and that is why
                        I have sent for you. Tremendous efforts will be made to capture or kill us
                        --and at all hazards to prevent my command from recrossing the Ohio. The
                        dice are thrown; <pb id="VAA3892-149" n="139"/> we are in the enemy's
                        country, with no hope of support from the South, and must depend upon our
                        own resources. And I say to you, Captain, that I am resolved to give them a
                        lively chase. We can scatter the legionaries and homeguards like so much
                        chaff, but we will have more than these un-tasseled cornstalks to contend
                        with before many days have gone by. Therefore I must know all I can, and
                        shall look to you for such information respecting my situation as you can
                        give."</p>
                    <p>"Such as an honorable soldier may give, who, by the fortunes of war, finds
                        himself treading as an enemy the soil in which his father is buried, is at
                        your service, General," said I, feeling safe in making the statement, for I
                        did not believe that he would ask more of me than this.</p>
                    <p>"I think I understand you," he said quickly, smiling, for my language must
                        have sounded to him a trifle grandiloquent "I shall not expect you to be
                        either guide or spy in your own bailiwick, as Colonel Duke would say in his
                        lawyer's flummery. What I want to know is not which road to take but whether
                        we have any friends among the inhabitants."</p>
                    <p>"I believe that there are many who, if not friends, are at least not enemies,
                        but I have no recent knowledge of them, and, I fear, can not much enlighten
                        you," I returned, with a suspicion that he knew a great deal more of the
                        matter than I.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-150" n="140"/>
                    <p>"I have been told," the General resumed, after a moment of silence, "that
                        there is a certain organization widespread throughout this State whose
                        members are friendly to the South. It has been said--and even promised by
                        some in authority, or at least claiming authority in the organization-- that
                        these men would rally to the assistance of any considerable Confederate
                        force that should cross the Ohio. Now, my force is not large, but it is
                        respectable and capable of giving an account of itself. Its presence here is
                        unexpected by these people and is actually due to a plan which, if long
                        premeditated, was somewhat suddenly resolved upon. So, perhaps we shall not
                        find them ready. Hines, of course, did not know that I was coming here, and
                        besides, he claims that he was kept so busy with his military somersaults
                        which finally landed him in the river that he had time for nothing
                        else."</p>
                    <p>Then I thought of Roger Bellray and of things he had talked about. Beyond
                        that I knew little and could only give the result of the inferences that I
                        had drawn.</p>
                    <p>"Doubtless there is an organization," I said, "but I do not believe that its
                        members will aid you actively, if at all. Possibly there are some among them
                        who sympathize with our cause, and these might be disposed, if the necessity
                        should come and the opportunity offer, to help us get out of this country.
                        We can not hope for <pb id="VAA3892-151" n="141"/> aid beyond that. These
                        malcontents, as I have heard, are mostly men who look upon the war as
                        fratricidal and unjustified. Outside of a few of the leaders in the movement
                        they are content to be let alone by both sides. If they fight at all it will
                        be against us rather than with us. And, if you will pardon me, I fear the
                        effect upon them if they are given cause to consider us freebooters."</p>
                    <p>"You are free of speech, Captain," returned the General, laughing; "but you
                        have been a bold soldier and we will not quarrel over trifles, for in war
                        this thing of which you speak is a trifle. We have many times in a pinch
                        enforced assistance from our friends, and there is no reason why we should
                        not compel it from our enemies, who seem, by the way, to be bountifully
                        supplied. Three thousand hungry cavalrymen in a strange country, with no
                        provision train following, are not expected to observe strictly the
                        distinction between mine and thine, as Colonel Duke observed a while ago.
                        Now, as to these other people--these knights of something or other--it is
                        really no great matter after all, as I have not depended upon them in the
                        least. I shall consider what you have said, and may consult you further.
                        Good-night."</p>
                    <p>Thus dismissing me and the subject he turned again to his map, pulling at his
                        heavy mustache. Accustomed to trust to his own resources, with <pb
                            id="VAA3892-152" n="142"/> unshaken confidence in his troopers and in
                        his own ability to overcome or evade any obstacle, his face was as serene as
                        if he had at his back an army of a hundred thousand instead of a mere
                        handful. He knew the metal of his men and laughed at the storm his presence
                        would provoke. That storm, alas, rose quickly and was more violent than this
                        bold spirit dreamed it would be.</p>
                    <p>I was not quite ready to take my leave, however, as I had a request to
                        prefer. So, in a few words, I told him about my mother and how it came that
                        she was there, and asked permission to leave the camp for a few hours to
                        visit her. He was tracing a line on the map with a pencil and did not,
                        apparently, give heed to what I was saying until he had made a heavy cross
                        on the paper. Then he looked up quickly and said:</p>
                    <p>"So your mother lives hereabouts? Well, God forbid that I should prevent your
                        seeing her. How far is it?"</p>
                    <p>"A distance of ten or twelve miles."</p>
                    <p>"Look out for the legionary fellows and don't scare them off; we shall want
                        some amusement to-morrow," he said, jocularly.</p>
                    <p>Then taking up a piece of paper he wrote and signed a leave of absence until
                        four o'clock in the morning. After receiving this writing from his hand
                        another matter that had been painfully in my mind at times during the day
                        recurred to me. I hesitated to mention it, but making a supreme <pb
                            id="VAA3892-153" n="143"/> effort it at last came out, while I felt my
                        face grow hot and flushed with my embarrassment.</p>
                    <p>"General, you know whether or not I have ever shirked any duty or danger
                        since I have been a member of your command?"</p>
                    <p>"What now, Captain," the great raider exclaimed, in wonder. "I bear willing
                        witness that you have been a true soldier and have even exceeded the high
                        anticipations of our friend Mandrell."</p>
                    <p>"Place me in the rear of the column to-morrow. Let the hands of others who
                        are wholly strangers to these people be lifted against them. I bear them no
                        grudge; many of them have befriended those who are dear to me, and my heart
                        fails me here."</p>
                    <p>"I respect your feelings," the General responded, considerately, "and it
                        shall be as you wish. Furthermore, I will guarantee special protection to
                        any for whom you may desire it. But I do not intend to fight these citizens
                        unless they make me."</p>
                    <p>With this he bade me good night again, and I returned to my quarters to make
                        ready for my journey. How different was this home coming from that other
                        one! Then I came alone and openly; now I returned with a hostile army and
                        must slip into my mother's presence past watchful foes like a thief in the
                        night. Again I was asking myself how should I find her--and that <pb

                        but once or twice we had heard indirectly of each other. A strangely
                        uncomfortable feeling possessed me. Surely, as I had told the General, my
                        heart was failing me in this unusual situation.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">HER BROTHER'S ACCUSER</head>
                    <p>O<hi rend="sc">THER</hi> things had happened on the fateful July day that
                        witnessed our crossing of the Ohio. At noonday the wide, two-storied house
                        of Roger Bellray held the attention of a small company of mounted men just
                        then approaching the foot of the lane leading to the house.</p>
                    <p>To the dust-soiled travelers who fixed their hot eyes upon it as its white
                        surface shimmered through the trees, it must have looked cool and inviting.
                        For so well was it shaded by the surrounding maples and elms that the
                        broiling sun could only reach it momentarily here and there as the leaves
                        shifted in the light breeze. Arriving at the entrance to the lane, a man
                        riding in advance of the others, and who appeared to be the leader of the
                        party which consisted of about a score of men, checked his horse. This
                        movement seemed to be taken by his companions as a signal to do likewise,
                        and the cavalcade came to a stop.</p>
                    <p>"If I am not mistaken, this is the place," said Io--L<hi rend="sc"
                            >EGIONARIES.</hi>
                        <pb id="VAA3892-156" n="146"/> the leader, directing his remark to no
                        particular person, as if certain of his ground. Several of the men, assuming
                        that an answer was expected, either in affirmation or denial, spoke up at
                        once, and assured him that he was right.</p>
                    <p>"He is the rankest copperhead in the whole country," asserted one, "and
                        absolutely refuses to fight for the government."</p>
                    <p>"Well, you haven't done much fighting yourself, Spelker," said a strong-faced
                        man, apparently of middle age. "I know Roger Bellray as well as any of you
                        and better than most, and I haven't any use for a copperhead, either, any
                        more than the rest of you, but even Beelzebub is entitled to his due. Joe
                        Barth's farm--you know Joe was killed at Stone River--lies over there a
                        matter of a mile or so. When he enlisted more than a year ago he left nobody
                        to look after things at home but his wife and three small children, the
                        oldest a girl of fourteen There were plenty of Union folks all around them,
                        but who was it that cut their wheat, and gathered their corn, and dug their
                        potatoes, and such like, without letting it cost them a cent? Why, Roger
                        Bellray's hired hands. And who sowed their wheat and planted their corn for
                        this year's crop, and who cut the wheat last week? Why, Roger Bellray's
                        hired hands. And who sowed their wheat and planted their corn for this
                        year's crop, and who cut the wheat last week? Why, Roger Bellray's men."</p>
                    <p>There was a touch of resentment and indignation in the speaker's tones that
                        turned all eyes upon him--except those of the leader, who was <pb
                            id="VAA3892-157" n="147"/> giving no attention to the talk--and some of
                        them were not of friendly look. This was notably so with Spelker, who was
                        quick to perceive the covert but unmistakable reflection on his own fighting
                        qualities. He was a much younger man than the other and, unlike most of his
                        companions, did not have the appearance of a man who followed rural
                        pursuits.</p>
                    <p>"I know something of Roger Bellray, too," he said, hotly, "and if he had his
                        just deserts he would be strung up as a warning to others of his kind."</p>
                    <p>"He hasn't interfered with your business of selling undersized mules to the
                        government, has he?" asked the older man, adding relevantly: "I should think
                        a man in your business would want the war to go on as long as possible."</p>
                    <p>"Dry up, men," the leader broke in sharply, with unmilitary phrase, lifting
                        his eyes from memoranda that he had been scanning, and noting the growing
                        ill-humor of the disputants. "All of you but Markle, Breezner and Thompson
                        ride into the shade over there and rest your horses."</p>
                    <p>With the three men named he then turned into the lane and galloped toward the
                        house, soon reaching the gate which separated the lane from the grounds
                        surrounding the buildings. One of the men opened it without dismounting,
                        and, with little regard for the graveled path, all rode their horses up to
                        the broad veranda that ran <pb id="VAA3892-158" n="148"/> along the front of
                        the residence and around its southern exposure.</p>
                    <p>Here the leader leaped to the ground and started to mount the steps. As he
                        did so a girl came through the open door. It was Kate Bellray. She had been
                        watching the horsemen for some time; had seen them stop in the road and
                        point toward the house, and had waited the coming of the four who now faced
                        her. Her eyes were steady and fearless, but they showed traces of anxiety as
                        she surveyed her unceremonious visitors.</p>
                    <p>On her appearance the leader stopped upon the porch steps, from which
                        position he now addressed her, without taking the pains to lift his hat.</p>
                    <p>"This is Roger Bellray's place, is it not?"</p>
                    <p>"It is," said the girl tersely.</p>
                    <p>"My name is Bracken--Captain Bracken," said the man, now removing his hat as
                        if in his own honor, and bowing stiffly, "and I desire an interview with Mr.
                        Bellray."</p>
                    <p>"I am sorry that you must be disappointed, sir, but unfortunately my brother
                        is not at home," said Kate, her uneasiness deepening.</p>
                    <p>"Will it avail me anything to ask where he is, and when he is expected to
                        return?" asked the visitor with growing politeness.</p>
                    <p>"He rode away this morning and left no word when he would come back. If you
                        desire to <pb id="VAA3892-159" n="149"/> leave any message for him I will
                        deliver it," she returned.</p>
                    <p>"Thank you," said he, "but it is entirely a personal matter. You are certain
                        are you, Miss Bellray, that your brother has left the house?"</p>
                    <p>His words and manner both expressed suspicion of her truthfulness and doubt
                        as to the accuracy of the information she had given. Raising her eyes and
                        looking toward the highway she saw the other members of his party standing
                        by their horses under the trees. She was filled with alarm, but kept her
                        self-possession, and the soft lines of her mouth showed a trifle more of
                        firmness.</p>
                    <p>"You are the first man, Captain Bracken, if that be your name and your title,
                        who has ever dared to question my word," she said with dignity. "While I do
                        not know your mission or purpose, you are at liberty to enter the house and
                        satisfy yourself. My brother does not hide from any man."</p>
                    <p>For a few moments the visitor was silent, as if uncertain about the way he
                        should act. Then he said:</p>
                    <p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Bellray, if I have unintentionally offended you. I
                        see clearly that my words were unwarranted. And, after all, the matter is of
                        small consequence"--here he coughed a little in an affected way that did not
                        escape her --"only a little information which I was told he <pb
                            id="VAA3892-160" n="150"/> could give me better than any other. We can
                        get along, I suppose, by inquiring elsewhere-- possibly at the next house.
                        May I trouble you to tell me who lives there?"</p>
                    <p>He pointed through the trees to a large gray house with tall red chimneys, a
                        mile away, which, with its substantial outbuildings, occupied a slight
                        elevation in the midst of a wide sweep of fine grounds. Next to the Bellray
                        place it was the most conspicuous one in the neighborhood, and belonged to
                        my mother.</p>
                    <p>"That place belongs to Mrs. Trenham," Kate said. "I am ignorant of the
                        character of the information you are seeking, but perhaps I can give it as
                        well as she or my brother."</p>
                    <p>"Mrs. Trenham, did you say, Miss?" the Captain inquired keenly, apparently
                        heedless of what else she had said. "Possibly she has a son?"</p>
                    <p>Kate felt that she had inadvertently given testimony that this man regarded
                        as valuable, but she answered calmly:</p>
                    <p>"She has a son somewhere."</p>
                    <p>"Who is not at home?" said the inquisitor.</p>
                    <p>"Not only that, but he has not been there for many months."</p>
                    <p>"Oh!" The exclamation showed disappointment of a hope that had been suddenly
                        aroused. Then he added with a smile that to her quick wits needed no
                        interpretation: "He is in the army, of course, fighting for his country--no
                        doubt a <pb id="VAA3892-161" n="151"/> fine young man. Thank you for your
                        trouble, Miss Bellray. Good-day."</p>
                    <p>He went quickly down the steps, climbed into his saddle and the quartet
                        trotted their horses out of the yard, leaving the gate open as they went,
                        and cantered down the lane. Kate walked to the gate and closed it, then
                        stood there until Captain Bracken and his companions had joined the men in
                        the highway, and until they all started away together. Nor did she leave her
                        post until the cloud of dust following the riders rose far beyond the
                        entrance to my mother's farm and showed that her late questioner had not
                        stopped there. Then with a deep sigh she went back to the veranda and sat
                        down.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, will it never end?" she said, half aloud. "Was there ever another
                        situated as I am? Oh, Roger; oh, John."</p>
                    <p>She buried her face in her hands, pressing it tightly, as if she would hide
                        from herself some frightful spectacle or a no less shocking truth. She did
                        not wish to think just then; her thoughts of late had kept her awake at
                        night and weighed heavily upon her spirits by day. As she sat there, feeling
                        that tears were near, but resolved that she would not shed them, an elderly
                        woman, wearing a frilled white cap on her gray hair, and a large white
                        handkerchief, folded crosswise, pinned loosely about her throat, came and
                        stood in the <pb id="VAA3892-162" n="152"/> doorway. Her eyes fell upon the
                        bent figure of the girl.</p>
                    <p>"What is the trouble, my dear?" she asked anxiously, going forward and
                        stroking affectionately the wavy hair and smoothing it away from the rounded
                        neck, throbbing with the hot young blood that coursed through it.</p>
                    <p>Reaching up and taking in her own the hand that rested so lovingly on her
                        head, Kate sprang to her feet</p>
                    <p>"Aunt Sarah," she exclaimed, fiercely, "they are going to arrest Roger."</p>
                    <p>"They--who? And why should he be arrested?" asked the aunt, in trembling
                        alarm, her face paling.</p>
                    <p>"Some awful men; I don't know who they are, only one of them said his name
                        was Captain Bracken. He didn't say he was going to arrest him, but I know
                        it, I feel it." She shuddered, as if stricken with a chill.</p>
                    <p>For a little time the elder woman was dumb. She had not seen what had taken
                        place, and could not understand the cause of this startling outburst. Her
                        lips moved as if she were trying to frame words into speech, but it was a
                        full minute before she could do so.</p>
                    <p>"Why should they want to arrest Roger, Kate?" she said at last, repeating her
                        former question. "What has he done that is unlawful? <pb id="VAA3892-163"
                            n="153"/> I think you have been frightened into nervousness, my
                        dear."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, don't you know? Can't you guess? It is because they think he belongs to
                        a terrible secret society that means to help the rebels, and is a traitor
                        and renegade."</p>
                    <p>"Hush, child, hush," said her aunt in a hoarse, excited whisper, looking
                        about her apprehensively. "It is impossible."</p>
                    <p>"I wish it were, but it is not; it is true."</p>
                    <p>"Girl," cried the old lady, moving away a little distance, and speaking in a
                        terrible voice, not loud, but tense with strong feeling, "you forget
                        yourself when you thus accuse your brother; you don't know what you
                        say."</p>
                    <p>Kate shook her head mournfully. "But he is," she said firmly, her face pale
                        with suppressed emotion. "I have tried not to believe it, to disguise it, to
                        call it by another name, but it is of no use. And yet I will die for him, if
                        by doing so I can save him from the shame of it."</p>
                    <p>She led her aunt to a chair and forced her into it, for she was trembling and
                        weak. Then Kate knelt by her side and became the comforter. With a sudden
                        revulsion of feeling she said pathetically:</p>
                    <p>"Do not think of the awful things I said, aunty. Let us keep our hearts
                        strong. Whatever he is we will fight for him, won't we?" Her voice was
                        child-like and pleading.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-164" n="154"/>
                    <p>"There, there, my dear," returned the aunt, soothingly, looking down into the
                        troubled eyes that were turned toward her's, blind with gathering tears. "It
                        can not be as bad as you think. You have misunderstood and have been
                        frightened. Roger is a brave, true man. He went to war to fight the
                        Mexicans. I have heard it told how daring he was--always at the place where
                        there was the most danger, always the first of his company in every charge.
                        You know he enlisted in Mississippi while there visiting your poor mother's
                        brother, and there is a letter in the house written by his colonel--"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, aunty; I know," Kate broke out, "but that colonel is now the arch
                        traitor of them all, and that letter should be destroyed."</p>
                    <p>"Do not forget that the writer was then fighting for his country, my
                        dear."</p>
                    <p>"No; nor that he is now trying to rend it asunder," said Kate, with
                        undiminished spirit.</p>
                    <p>Aunt Sarah was silent She was as patriotic as her niece, but age had cooled
                        her blood. After an interval she spoke again:</p>
                    <p>"At all events, my child, remember that Roger Bellray is the kindest and
                        gentlest of men. He has been both father and brother to you and as good as a
                        son to me, a woman to whom children have been denied. He has his own reasons
                        for anything that he may do, and we must give him <pb id="VAA3892-165"
                            n="155"/> credit for honesty and courage, wherever his opinions may lead
                        him. Other people have their troubles in these terrible times as well as we.
                        There is Mrs. Trenham, poor lady, whose boy is in the rebel army."</p>
                    <p>A flush spread over Kate's face as she responded: "Yes, Aunt Sarah, but he
                        was born in the South and his father and all of his people were southerners.
                        These things make a great difference, and I admire him because he has gone
                        out to fight, though he is wrong, oh, so wrong."</p>
                    <p>She confessed it all to me afterward; at first little by little, with much of
                        the old playful perversity, then in detail and connectedly, withholding
                        nothing.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, my dear," said Aunt Sarah, placing her hand on the fair head resting
                        face downward on the chair arm, "you admire him for reasons beyond
                        that--reasons that come from your heart, if such a thing can be. I saw how
                        it was before he went away, and--forgive me, child--I heard you crying your
                        poor eyes out that night in your room when you knew he was going. And when
                        the war is over, my dear--"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, when the war is over--"</p>
                    <p>"And peace has come and everything is forgiven and forgotten, there will be
                        happiness for you and for us all. Let us pray that never again in this land
                        will a strife come that will divide <pb id="VAA3892-166" n="156"/> families
                        and bring the heartaches that this has brought. Be patient, my dear, and
                        strong, and whatever happens to your brother be true to him as he has been
                        true to you."</p>
                    <p>They rose and went into the house.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE SHOOTING OF BELLRAY</head>
                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> was late that afternoon when Roger Bellray came home.
                        To the anxious eyes of his sister, who had awaited his coming in great
                        suspense, he seemed singularly gloomy and preoccupied. He greeted her with
                        accustomed affection and then went to his working room at a corner of the
                        house, where he shut himself in and remained until summoned to the evening
                        meal.</p>
                    <p>Having eaten sparingly, as if without appetite, he again repaired to his
                        room, and, as had lately been his habit, turned the bolt behind him. For
                        weeks he had carried the key to the one door in his pocket, and had
                        forbidden entrance in his absence. At table he had been mostly silent; and
                        when to inquiries or statements addressed to him he would either make no
                        response, or else answer with an irrelevance that showed overwhelming
                        abstraction, attempts at conversation ceased altogether.</p>
                    <p>Kate found no opportunity to speak to him of Captain Bracken's visit,
                        although she was burning with eagerness to do so. She was filled with <pb
                            id="VAA3892-168" n="158"/> a dread which approached terror, and had an
                        intuitive conviction that he was threatened with some great danger. Much of
                        the talk of the country concerning her brother had reached her. The
                        sentiment was divided, some speaking for him and others bitterly denouncing
                        him. Among the former class were those who shared his political opinions,
                        and they were considerable in number. Many of these, however, did not
                        approve of conduct of which she had heard only vague hints, but which his
                        enemies summed up in the one word--treason; the majority desiring peace for
                        themselves, did not see fit to be too assertive in behalf of another.</p>
                    <p>Their timid, half-hearted apologies were taken as proof of all that was
                        charged, and did far more harm than good. In his own conversations with her
                        he had frankly admitted enough to confirm a great deal of the suspicion
                        directed against him. His many long and unexplained absences, meetings
                        behind a locked door sometimes with his friends, often with strangers
                        together with recent mysterious night rides from which he would not return
                        oftentimes till daybreak, in her mind could not be reconciled with good
                        citizenship.</p>
                    <p>What did they mean? These and other things filled her with foreboding and
                        apprehension and caused her to believe that he was engaged in some secret
                        undertaking or conspiracy. The latter word forced itself into her unwilling
                        mind, <pb id="VAA3892-169" n="159"/> and called up visions of all that was
                        sinister, hideous and repellent.</p>
                    <p>Was the storm that he had provoked now ready to break about his misguided but
                        undaunted head? Kate hesitated long before disturbing him, and consulted
                        with her aunt about the matter. The latter agreed with her as to the
                        importance of acquainting him with what had taken place, although she still
                        affected, with poor success, to treat the incident lightly. When Kate had
                        once made up her mind she acted promptly.</p>
                    <p>Going to the door behind which Roger sat she rapped smartly upon its oaken
                        panelling. In a moment she heard the bolt slip back, the door was opened an
                        inch or two, and behind the crack appeared her brother's face. There was
                        something so furtive and unnatural in the eyes that met hers that she
                        involuntarily recoiled. The curtains had been drawn though it was yet
                        daylight, and the room was in semi-darkness.</p>
                    <p>"What is it, Kate?" he asked. His voice had in it a quality that she had
                        heard before on only one occasion, and that was when he had started out to
                        find and chastise a drunken boor who had insulted her on the highway; it was
                        cold and steely, like the clink of a sword.</p>
                    <p>"Roger, I must speak with you," she said, her face now close to his own.</p>
                    <p>"Put it off until to-morrow, dear; I am very <pb id="VAA3892-170" n="160"/>
                        busy," he returned more softly, making a motion as if to close the door.</p>
                    <p>"But I can not, Roger," she persisted appealingly, quickly thrusting her hand
                        in the aperture that he might not shut her out. "I must speak to you
                        to-night--now; your own safety is concerned, my brother. Even in an hour it
                        may be too late."</p>
                    <p>Her words and manner plainly made an impression upon him and convinced him
                        that it was not an ordinary communication that she wanted to make. He looked
                        at her intently for a moment, then turned his head and seemed to survey the
                        room. Facing her again he said hastily:</p>
                    <p>"Wait a moment and you may come in here."</p>
                    <p>He closed and fastened the door, and while she stood waiting for it to be
                        opened again she heard him moving about, and sounds that seemed to indicate
                        that he was putting the contents of the room in order. Presently he came and
                        admitted her.</p>
                    <p>"Now, what is it that troubles you?" he said quickly. "Don't mind my manner,
                        little girl," he added, instantly conscious that the abrupt, almost savage
                        inquiry had startled her. "I have much on my mind to-night."</p>
                    <p>Much on his mind! She knew it without the telling and had come to add still
                        more, but only to save him from a worse fate.</p>
                    <p>"Roger, you are in danger of arrest," she said.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-171" n="161"/>
                    <p>"Oh, is that all you have to tell me?" he exclaimed, with a dry laugh. "My
                        arrest has been many times threatened, but I will not be intimidated and
                        have so warned them. They will not dare do it."</p>
                    <p>He had seated himself at a narrow table occupying the center of the room, and
                        had placed a chair for her near his own.</p>
                    <p>"This is different, brother; they have been here to-day looking for you."</p>
                    <p>"Who?" The word was uttered contemptuously.</p>
                    <p>"Several mounted men -- strangers--headed by one who called himself Captain
                        Bracken."</p>
                    <p>"Captain Bracken!" Roger rose to his feet, all indifference gone, and his
                        eyes blazing through the shadows that were rapidly gathering. One of the
                        curtains fluttering at an open window attracted his attention, and he walked
                        quickly across the room and pulled down and fastened the sash, a service
                        that he likewise performed at the sole remaining window, though the room was
                        already hot and close. Then he came back and resumed his seat.</p>
                    <p>"How many men did he have?" he asked.</p>
                    <p>All traces of his sudden excitement had gone save the fire that smouldered in
                        his eyes, and the question was asked in a matter of fact way, as if he took
                        little interest in the occurrence but II--L<hi rend="sc">EGIONARIES.</hi>
                        <pb id="VAA3892-172" n="162"/> merely desired to gratify an idle curiosity.
                        Kate was not deceived, however; she knew that he regarded the information as
                        of vital importance.</p>
                    <p>"Three were with him at the house and I counted fifteen more in the road. The
                        three looked as if they might be military men of some sort, but most of the
                        others, I think, were home-guards; some of them appeared to be farmers. I
                        thought I recognized the government horse buyer, Spelker.</p>
                    <p>"Kate, you are right, I am in danger," Roger said gently, but with a certain
                        tenseness that deepened her alarm. "If this Bracken contemplates my
                        arrest--as he no doubt does--he will leave no stone unturned to accomplish
                        it. He is a persistent and implacable man-hunter who takes his orders and
                        pursues them unremittingly and to the letter. I find no fault with him for
                        that; he is only doing his duty. My quarrel is with those who have set the
                        hounds on my track, and I shall not give them the satisfaction they seek if
                        I can help it. Because my opinions have differed from theirs they have
                        annoyed and threatened me, and now, it seems, have determined to run me
                        down. Military law has taken the place of the civil law, and trials by court
                        martial have been substituted for trials by jury even in this state, where
                        the courts are open and the civil authorities capable of fulfilling their
                        functions. If I am taken by the minions of the <pb id="VAA3892-173" n="163"
                        /> provost I have no assurance of a fair hearing, nor even of a trial
                        itself. Constitutional government in this country is at an end and partisan
                        hate and drum-head injustice are running riot to the distraction of the
                        people."</p>
                    <p>He spoke at first with calmness and self-restraint, but as he proceeded his
                        sister perceived a growing rancor. She had heard him talk somewhat in this
                        strain before, but not in the same manner. Every word dropped from his lips
                        white-hot, like sparks from the anvil under the hammer of the smith, and she
                        trembled as she thought of what might happen if those whom he considered his
                        enemies should now come suddenly upon him. He had indulged her antagonistic
                        views as childish and harmless, while she, in her patriotic innocence, had
                        considered him affected by a mania peculiar to troublous times and
                        intensified by a narrow intolerance on the part of some of his neighbors.
                        But there was something so deadly in his manner now that she was dumb.</p>
                    <p>"These friends of yours, my sister," he continued, not unkindly yet with a
                        faint touch of irony, "purpose to ruin me and possibly to have my life. I do
                        not intend to allow the one nor to yield the other. Listen: Within two hours
                        I could have enough men here to rid the country of Captain Bracken and his
                        force; within six hours I could have an army. That sounds like bragging, you
                        think, but it is not so. General Morgan crossed <pb id="VAA3892-174" n="164"
                        /> the river to-day at Brandenburg with three thousand cavalry."</p>
                    <p>It was so dark in the room that he could not see how this statement affected
                        Kate, but she felt her face grow cold as the blood left it, then hot and
                        flushed as it came back again--partly, as she admitted in recounting these
                        facts, because a certain captain of horse, if alive, was with General
                        Morgan, but more on account of the impudence of the fearless raider himself.
                        She had heard much of his remarkable exploits, but did not believe that he
                        would dare attempt to ride the highways of the North as he had those of the
                        South, clanking defiance to his foes.</p>
                    <p>Roger without pausing went on: "I knew this rebel chieftain in Mexico, as I
                        have told you. We were in the hospital together. If I should say the word he
                        would make quick work of my enemies. He would ride them down as grass under
                        his horse's feet."</p>
                    <p>"But you will not say it, will you, Roger? You will find some other way." Her
                        voice had come to her again, and once started she continued vehemently:
                        "This dreadful man should be driven back into the river and John Trenham
                        with him."</p>
                    <p>"They are hard men to drive; they have been in the habit of driving others.
                        As to asking help from General Morgan, I shall not do so if I can avoid it.
                        Only in the last extremity could I <pb id="VAA3892-175" n="165"/> think of
                        so wild a thing. I am sorry he has come here and hope he will speedily
                        depart, for his coming only intensifies local prejudice and adds to the
                        difficulties of men like myself."</p>
                    <p>There was a ring of genuine regret in his tones, and something else that she
                        could not define but that made her heart ache. He arose and walked up and
                        down the floor, his head bent forward, his hands opening and closing
                        nervously. Presently he resumed his seat.</p>
                    <p>"Kate," he said, "this is my house and I have a right to stay here and a
                        right to defend it. In the eyes of the law I swear that I have committed no
                        crime, but there is no longer any law. To disagree with the opinions held by
                        the majority has now become the greatest offense, and no punishment, however
                        atrocious or malignant, is too severe to be meted out to the culprit. But I
                        shall not run or hide; instead, I will stay here and defy them all, and
                        fight them if they push me to it--yes, fight them, by God!" He lifted his
                        clenched hand high above his head in a gesture of profound anger and
                        determination.</p>
                    <p>"Roger, think of what you say and of what you would do--the consequences, the
                        ruin of it. Think of yourself and--me."</p>
                    <p>"You?" He paused and his arm fell nerveless on the table. "Heaven forgive me,
                        child, for I had only myself in mind. You--our dead mother's last born."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-176" n="166"/>
                    <p>He uttered the final words slowly, huskily, and there was something strangely
                        like a half-suppressed sob following them.</p>
                    <p>"No, no; don't think of me," she cried, brokenly, deeply affected by his
                        emotion. "I was selfish to say it. You must act as you believe right; only
                        avoid a conflict, for the odds against you are so many."</p>
                    <p>"I don't care for the odds, and would not if they were still greater," he
                        said, again getting up. Taking her hands in his own he raised her to her
                        feet. "What I see now, is, that if the calamity of which I spoke should
                        come, you would suffer more than I. There will be a day of reckoning, but it
                        need not be this day or tomorrow. For your sake--for the sake of your peace
                        of mind and happiness--I am going to do a thing that I would do for no one
                        else on earth. I will leave home for a time and possibly the storm will pass
                        over. If I stay here I must either submit to be deprived of my liberty and
                        subjected to indignity and insult, or make of this house a fortress and
                        maintain it by force of arms. This I had thought of doing, had even planned
                        to do as against your guerrilla homeguards, but I have no purpose to array
                        myself against the power of the United States government, and it is that
                        power which this Bracken represents. They call me a traitor. Pah!"</p>
                    <p>He released her hands and going to the end of <pb id="VAA3892-177" n="[]"/>

                        <pb id="VAA3892-178" n="167"/> the room where there was a mantel above a
                        wide fire-place struck a match and lighted a lamp. Then, stooping, he threw
                        aside a corner of the heavy drugget that covered the floor and in a moment
                        had made a narrow opening through the planking. She watched him in
                        amazement.</p>
                    <p>"Come here, Kate," he called, and she went to his side. "Do you think I am
                        prepared to make a defense?" he asked, holding the lamp so that its light
                        shone into the cavity.</p>
                    <p>The opening into which she looked with startled eyes--the presence of which
                        she had not before even suspected--was of unknown dimensions, but what she
                        could see of it was heaped with rifles and revolvers. One glance at the
                        deadly store, then she drew back, her face pale and quivering. Roger,
                        quickly making things as they were, placed the lamp upon the mantel and
                        turned toward his sister, who had not for a second removed her gaze from his
                        face after lifting it from the hurried inspection of the concealed
                        vault.</p>
                    <p>"I can trust you, Kate," he said, not attempting to avoid her eyes, in which
                        he read pity as well as condemnation. "I had not intended to tell you about
                        this, but it is best that you should know. As for me, it will be the worse
                        if these things are discovered here, for they will be evidence against me.
                        If the house is searched and they are found, tell the truth; do not try to
                        shield me. There is no time for me to have them <pb id="VAA3892-179" n="168"
                        /> removed now, but I will speak to Sutton about it, and he can dispose of
                        them if they give him time enough."</p>
                    <p>Sutton was his farm manager, and while he was quiet and close of mouth, Kate
                        suspected that his opinions were the same as her brother's, for he was in
                        the latter's confidence and was devoted to him.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, Roger, I did not guess that it had come to this," she said, her voice
                        strained and husky, as if she were on the point of giving way to tears.</p>
                    <p>The reproach that her words implied seemed to touch him keenly. A momentary
                        resentment flashed across his face but instantly died out, and the only
                        answer he made was to say gently:</p>
                    <p>"You do not know all, little girl. Some day I may tell you what I have been
                        compelled to submit to and why these arms are here. Now don't say anything
                        more; you can not understand, but until you do, keep your heart open to me,
                        for you are all I have. Send Sutton to me here -- he must be about the
                        house--and tell Williams to saddle my horse at once and take him to the back
                        lane and wait for me. Goodbye, child. Do not fret about me. Everything is in
                        order except that" -- pointing at the floor-- "for I have foreseen some such
                        emergency as this and planned against it. There--good-bye; now go to Sutton
                        and Williams."</p>
                    <p>While he was speaking he was walking toward <pb id="VAA3892-180" n="169"/>
                        the door, one arm around her shoulders, and when he reached it he kissed her
                        affectionately and let her pass out.</p>
                    <p>As soon as she was out of the room Kate hastened to execute her brother's
                        commands, for any further delay might endanger his safety. Having done this
                        she went out upon the porch and sat down, a self-appointed sentinel.</p>
                    <p>The sun had long since vanished behind the low western hills, above which
                        hung the moon in its first quarter, and twilight was deepening into
                        darkness. The air was sweet and balmy and the peacefulness of earth and sky
                        made her troubles seem all the greater by contrast. The fire-flies flashed
                        their yellow lights here and there through the shrubbery, and far up in the
                        sky, sounded the cry of the whippoorwill as it circled through the dusk.
                        From distant pasture fields came the faint, occasional tinkle of sheep bells
                        and the lowing of cattle. A boy was whistling vigorously in the barn-lot,
                        his evening tasks accomplished, and she noticed that the tune which had
                        struck his fancy was that of a new patriotic song.</p>
                    <p>But presently there came to her ears through the night another sound, dull,
                        thumping and ominous. It came from somewhere far down the highway, and was
                        made by the galloping feet of many horses. There was no mistaking that sound
                        --Captain Bracken was coming back, as she had known he would. What troubled
                        her was that <pb id="VAA3892-181" n="170"/> the noise seemed to be divided
                        and to come from different places in the road, as if the approaching
                        horsemen were separated. Almost as soon as she realized this fact she dimly
                        saw several rapidly-moving shadows at the mouth of the lane, reaching which
                        they appeared to change form and to become stationary. But it was not so;
                        they were turning into the lane and were coming toward her.</p>
                    <p>All doubt removed, she ran into the house and to her brother's door upon
                        which she beat frantically with her hands, calling out that he should make
                        haste. But there was no answer to her blows or cries. She grasped the knob
                        and shook it violently. To her great astonishment the door opened and she
                        fell upon the threshold. Getting to her feet, she entered the room, only to
                        find it empty and dark. Roger had gone.</p>
                    <p>A great load seemed to be lifted from her. Instantly she became calm and
                        prepared herself to meet the unwelcome visitors, who could now be heard at
                        the gate. By the time she had reached the hall heavy steps sounded on the
                        porch, then loud knocking on the casing of the open door. A servant entered
                        the hall in response to the knocking, but Kate walked before her toward the
                        man who was standing impatiently just within the entrance; it was Captain
                        Bracken. He greeted her civilly and inquired abruptly for her brother.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-182" n="171"/>
                    <p>"Mr. Bellray is not at home," she answered, quietly.</p>
                    <p>"Look here, my young lady," said the officer incisively, "you must tell me
                        where he is or I shall be obliged to take it upon myself to find out."</p>
                    <p>"What do you want with him?" she asked, with the wish to gain time, for she
                        felt that every minute might be valuable to Roger.</p>
                    <p>"I want nothing with him; I want him," he said with a grim but poor attempt
                        at humor. "He will understand my business quick enough if he is as smart as
                        they say he is, and, mind you, I have no time to waste. One of my men that I
                        left in the neighborhood for that purpose saw him return home this
                        afternoon, and knows that he had not left this house up to thirty minutes
                        ago. Excuse me, Miss Bellray, but he can not escape; my men are everywhere
                        about the place, and every road, lane and by-way is watched."</p>
                    <p>Without further parley he called from the door and three men came to him--the
                        same who had been with him on his previous appearance.</p>
                    <p>"Search the house, and be quick about it," he commanded, and they scattered
                        in obedience.</p>
                    <p>"Pardon the liberty I am taking, Miss Bellray. My duty requires of me many
                        unpleasant services," the captain explained, apologetically.</p>
                    <p>Kate, who had seated herself, made no response, but listened composedly to
                        the noise made <pb id="VAA3892-183" n="172"/> by the searchers, as they,
                        having possessed themselves with lights, went through the house from room to
                        room. By the time they had returned to their leader to report their search
                        fruitless, the hall was filled with the members of the household, gaping and
                        staring, and in a high state of excitement and alarm, which the calm face of
                        the young mistress tended greatly to allay.</p>
                    <p>"You see, sir," she said satirically, addressing the officer, "that you would
                        have saved yourself much unnecessary trouble if you had been disposed to
                        believe me. But I felt assured that you would not, though you merely desired
                        a little information from my brother which you believed he could give better
                        than any other."</p>
                    <p>While she spoke lightly she was apprehensive over Captain Bracken's statement
                        that all the ways leading from the place were watched, and feared that
                        Roger's escape was impossible. The captain, on his part, was in very bad
                        humor over his defeat, and with mutterings of anger, in which could be heard
                        half-suppressed oaths, hurriedly left the house with his men, Kate following
                        as far as the porch.</p>
                    <p>They were in the act of mounting their horses when the dull sound of shots,
                        fired irregularly and seemingly far away, disturbed the quiet of the night.
                        Jumping into their saddles, with an exclamation that froze the blood in the
                        veins of Kate and others of the household who had trooped <pb
                            id="VAA3892-184" n="173"/> out upon the porch after her in their
                        anxiety, the men dashed down the lane as if eager to have a hand in the
                        hunt.</p>
                    <p>"They are after him!" That was what they had said.</p>
                    <p>Checking all attempts at talking, Kate, every sense strained and acute, ran
                        down to the gate at the end of the graveled path and stood there filled with
                        terror. After the first shots the silence had been broken for a time only by
                        the rapid thumping of the fleeing horses' feet on the hard ground. But now
                        came another shot, and another, and yet a third much clearer than the others
                        had been, showing that those who had fired them were moving toward the
                        house. And this time, too, they sounded across the fields and were
                        accompanied by the hoarse cries of men. Not a moan escaped the lips of the
                        girl, but her teeth were tightly clenched and her hands gripped each other
                        wildly in the agony of her emotion.</p>
                    <p>The noises came nearer--the shouting, the cursing, the intermittent shooting;
                        then the patter of running feet coming from the direction of the orchard to
                        her left. Suddenly a man leaped the fence separating the orchard from the
                        yard and came running toward the house, bareheaded, his clothes torn and
                        disarranged and with a smoking revolver in his hand; it was Roger. He had
                        nearly reached the place where she stood, when another shot rang out sharply
                        and he pitched <pb id="VAA3892-185" n="174"/> wildly forward and fell face
                        downward almost at her feet.</p>
                    <p>Kate ran forward and endeavored to help him to rise, but no answering
                        movement rewarded her effort, and as she released the motionless form her
                        hands were wet with his life's blood. Just then the pursuers dashed into the
                        yard, breathless and panting, and foremost among them was Spelker, the
                        horse-buyer. He stooped and turned the body over roughly, as if it were the
                        carcass of a wild beast.</p>
                    <p>"A mighty good riddance," exclaimed he, with heartless brutality, "and I
                        think I am entitled to the credit for it."</p>
                    <p>"Did you kill my brother?" cried Kate, breaking away from her aunt and the
                        others who had come about her, and moving quickly toward the speaker. Her
                        eyes blazed through the deathly pallor of her face, and she looked the very
                        embodiment of vengeance.</p>
                    <p>Spelker drew back, but assumed a defiant air: "I wasn't talking to you, Miss,
                        but since you ask the question I'll say I think I did. We had orders to
                        ketch him."</p>
                    <p>"It is murder--murder, and you will pay for his life; remember it, you worse
                        than monster!" she cried, in a voice that made his soul shrink.</p>
                    <p>As she was led away from the terrible scene, Captain Bracken pushed his way
                        into the crowd, throwing men aside, right and left. When he <pb
                            id="VAA3892-186" n="175"/> saw what had been done he was furious,
                        demanded to know who had committed the deed, and swore that his orders had
                        been exceeded. Spelker slunk into the background, and when the men went away
                        it was remarked that he was shunned by many of his companions and walked by
                        himself to the place where those who were dismounted had left their horses.
                        One man lingered a little behind, and stooping quickly took one of the
                        lifeless hands reverently in his, pressed it tenderly, and then hastened on
                        after the others. It was the elderly man who had spoken in Roger's favor at
                        the entrance to the lane. Even among his enemies he had friends.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE GARB OF A REBEL</head>
                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> news that Roger Bellray, "the butternut," had been
                        shot traveled slowly that night in the district where the violence had been
                        committed. Many who heard the firing knew that Morgan's raiders had come
                        into the county that day and attributed it to marauding bands from his force
                        seeking to terrorize the inhabitants. Thus believing, and considering that
                        they had no business abroad while these reckless men were about, they took
                        counsel of their fears and shut themselves up in their homes, there to stay
                        until daylight, but not to sleep.</p>
                    <p>My mother, however, not far from whose house the first shots had been fired,
                        knew better. The Bellray land extended to within a few hundred yards of her
                        residence, and what was known as the back lane furnished a more private and
                        convenient communication between the two places than the public road.</p>
                    <p>One of her servants, a negro, returning that evening from Corydon at
                        nightfall, had been overtaken by a party of mounted men and questioned <pb
                            id="VAA3892-188" n="177"/> by one as to the existence of any private
                        means of access to the Bellray premises. Before he could answer, another of
                        the party, in whom he recognized a horse-buyer who had tried in vain to
                        persuade my mother to part with some of her stock, spoke up and said that he
                        knew of the back lane, adding that it ought to be watched as "he" would most
                        likely try to escape by it.</p>
                    <p>The negro remembered this man particularly because of his former insolent
                        bearing. He had gone so far as to accuse my mother of saving her animals for
                        the use of the rebels when they should come, and had otherwise caused her to
                        be subjected to petty annoyances. The servant, therefore, hastened to tell
                        her of these mysterious things, and they certainly lost nothing of their
                        strangeness in the recital.</p>
                    <p>From this my mother surmised that something seriously affecting her neighbor
                        was afoot. Not long after, she heard the firing and shouting, which noises
                        rapidly receded toward Bellray's. After an interval came the final shot,
                        smothered by the distance, and then silence, which was broken later by the
                        clatter of many hoofs galloping in the direction of the town. These
                        unexplained and extraordinary things were so disquieting that she became
                        highly nervous and agitated, starting at harmless noises and half fearing an
                        attack upon her own home.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-189" n="178"/>
                    <p>So great had been the effect of these neighborhood events upon the servant
                        that the wonderful and terrifying news of the rebel invasion, which was
                        being talked of in the town to the exclusion of every other topic, and which
                        had brought out and armed the inhabitants for resistance, was for the time
                        driven from his mind, and was not communicated by him to my mother along
                        with the fresher happening. When the information did reach her it came from
                        the kitchen, where the black bearer of ill tidings had told it to Martha,
                        the cook, under the stimulating effects of his belated supper, and she
                        related it to the mistress of the establishment.</p>
                    <p>The impression it made upon her was profound and for a while she was nearly
                        overwhelmed by this additional shock. For the news brought with it both hope
                        and dread--hope that she might be permitted to see her son, and dread of the
                        consequences of the bold step that my commander had taken. But in the end
                        the hope overbore all other considerations, and by it her spirits were
                        rallied. She believed that I would come to her if it were possible--it might
                        be that night--and so resolved to remain awake and wait.</p>
                    <p>For a time she made an effort to read, but could not; she tried to engage her
                        mind at some light sewing with which she was wont to beguile herself, but
                        threw it aside. Again and again she <pb id="VAA3892-190" n="179"/> went to
                        her open window, looked out into the night and listened.</p>
                    <p>It was at the window, about an hour before midnight, that I saw her. The
                        light in her room threw her figure into bold relief. I had already
                        dismounted and tied my horse and was at the gate, where I paused a moment to
                        make sure of my surroundings. Then I hurried toward the house and placed
                        myself beneath her window.</p>
                    <p>"Mother," said I. She gasped with joy and leaned out.</p>
                    <p>"Is it you, my boy?" she called down to me, tremulously.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, mother; it is John."</p>
                    <p>In a moment, almost, she was downstairs at the door, and had opened it and
                        thrown herself into my arms. And when she had got me into the house she sat
                        by my chair, stroking my brown cheeks and smoothing my hair as in the days
                        of my childhood. A son returning to his mother from the wars is like one
                        coming back from the grave, and for a time she can do no more than look at
                        him and hear his voice and lavish upon him those little loving attentions
                        which only a mother can bestow.</p>
                    <p>So it was now; but presently she bethought herself and ordered that supper be
                        prepared for me. When it was ready and I was at the table I asked her about
                        the Bellrays. In the joy of having me with her again she had forgotten all
                        else, <pb id="VAA3892-191" n="180"/> but my question brought forth a recital
                        of the startling happenings of the early evening. She told me, also, of
                        other things concerning these friends.</p>
                    <p>"I must know what that shooting means, mother," I said, greatly troubled and
                        guessing the truth. "I will ride over there at once."</p>
                    <p>Without doing that much I could not have returned to camp satisfied. While
                        finishing the meal, which I did hastily after that, I asked many questions
                        and learned that Roger Bellray was in very bad repute with those people of
                        the county who favored a vigorous prosecution of the war against the
                        seceding states, and who held that any belief which did not rise to the full
                        height of their own was treasonable.</p>
                    <p>He was also suspected--not without reason, as I knew--of holding relations of
                        some sort with friends of the Confederacy, and of giving information and
                        rendering other assistance to the government of the Secessionists. As to the
                        latter suspicion, I did not believe it justified. But Bellray was a daring
                        man of deep feeling and many extreme views, and capable of doing or
                        undertaking to do the thing that was most violently opposed by others, even
                        though it did not commend itself wholly to his judgment.</p>
                    <p>I did not know, therefore, how far local antagonism and proscription had
                        driven him, nor to what perverse conduct he had been provoked. <pb
                            id="VAA3892-192" n="181"/> But this I did know, then and afterward, that
                        he refused to open his mind in recognition of the spirit of the times. He
                        believed that he might still assert his independence as a man, and that the
                        right to think and talk as he pleased should not be denied to him any more
                        than to those whose views upon public questions differed from his own. His
                        trouble lay in failing to realize that traits of character which may be
                        given full sway with impunity in time of peace are, in time of civil war,
                        dangerous possessions in a locality where the people maintain a conflicting
                        and unfriendly sentiment.</p>
                    <p>To my great relief I found that my mother had lived quietly and without
                        notable disturbance. True, she felt that she had been socially isolated and
                        discountenanced since it became known that I had "joined the rebels." But it
                        had also come to her in a roundabout way that the people had not expected me
                        to do anything else, considering my southern birth and connection.</p>
                    <p>She had remained mostly at home, seeing few visitors, and had maintained
                        intimate relations with none excepting the Bellray household, which was, as
                        everybody knew, divided in opinion upon the questions of the day, though
                        still united in the love and confidence that had distinguished the family
                        life. How it would be with her from this time on if it became generally
                        known that I was an officer under the great raider I hardly <pb
                            id="VAA3892-193" n="182"/> dared to think. And yet I felt that she would
                        remain free from serious annoyance unless, by some unlucky deed, the
                        populace should be aroused to a resentment so violent that it would injure
                        the innocent if the guilty were not at hand.</p>
                    <p>It was long past midnight when I rode away from my mother's gate. A few
                        minutes brought me to the familiar path called the back lane, which ran
                        between the fields to the Bellray house. Save the steady thumping of my
                        horse's feet on the dry turf few sounds broke the stillness of the night.
                        The rasping song of the katydid, and here and there the heavy breathing of a
                        cow by the roadside, the distant bark of a dog, the fluttering of a bird
                        awakened from its nap in the hedge-- these I heard, and nothing besides.</p>
                    <p>Many times before I had ridden through these fields, so fragrant this night
                        with the breath of clover, but how different the circumstances, how widely
                        different my thoughts! How was it now with Roger Bellray? Why were armed men
                        seeking an obscure way to his house? And what was the cause and the result
                        of the commotion of which my mother had told?</p>
                    <p>Quickening my speed, I soon reached the well-remembered bars separating the
                        lane from the driveway that ran from there along the edge of the peach
                        orchard and toward the side of the house where there was a small garden
                        gate; this opened <pb id="VAA3892-194" n="183"/> into a shaded walk winding
                        to the front of the house. Securing my horse at the bars I hurried forward.
                        It seemed years instead of months since I had been there, so full of events
                        had my recent life been crowded.</p>
                    <p>When the house came into view amidst the slumbering trees I saw that a bright
                        light was burning in the upper room that Roger had formerly occupied; lights
                        glowing also from the living rooms showed that the household was astir. I
                        went through the little gateway, which I found open, and moved up the walk
                        through the deep shadows.</p>
                    <p>The evidences of wakefulness at this hour did not in themselves alarm me, for
                        there would be little sleep that night wherever the news of the coming of
                        the raiders penetrated, so wild and inaccurate were the opinions held
                        concerning my gallant General and his men. But these signs of unrest added
                        to the other things of which I had heard intensified the fear that already
                        oppressed me.</p>
                    <p>I had just reached the black shade of a gigantic syringa standing a little
                        way from the house when two persons, a man and a woman, came through the
                        open door and walked to the edge of the porch, where they stood in the flood
                        of light pouring through the doorway and windows. Within the hall was Mrs.
                        Willing, who stood irresolute <pb id="VAA3892-195" n="184"/> for a moment
                        and then turned and ascended the stairs.</p>
                    <p>The man was Dallas Vawter, the woman, Kate Bellray. It was with difficulty
                        that I restrained an ejaculation of angry surprise. Had this man after all
                        told me the truth at Brandenburg? I would have moved away, but to do so was
                        impossible without revealing my presence, and this was the last thing I
                        desired to do while Vawter remained. I was within ten feet of them, and
                        every word they spoke, though their voices were at first low, came to my
                        ears distinctly. Vawter was the first to speak, and from his words it was
                        plain that they had as yet held little conversation.</p>
                    <p>"I could not rest without coming to offer my sympathy, Miss Bellray," he
                        said, with well simulated feeling. "It was reported in town that your
                        brother was killed, and I am gratified to learn that the scoundrels
                        failed."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, thank God, they failed," she returned, fervently. "And you are very
                        kind to trouble yourself so much about our poor affairs, when you must be
                        needed so badly elsewhere this wretched night."</p>
                    <p>"A wretched night, indeed, filled with dangers and alarms; but you ought to
                        know that I would do anything in the world for you." He moved a little
                        nearer to her, and reaching out endeavored to take her hand. She drew back
                        from <pb id="VAA3892-196" n="185"/> him, but he went on: "Kate, I love you;
                        you must already have known it."</p>
                    <p>"Please do not speak of such a thing, Mr. Vawter," she exclaimed, moving away
                        as he advanced. "I did not suspect you of thinking that way about me; I
                        supposed you came here only to see my brother."</p>
                    <p>Vawter's manner changed quickly.</p>
                    <p>"Indeed," he returned, with a sneer that revealed to her the nature of the
                        man more clearly than any words. "But I will speak of it, if it is the very
                        last thing I ever do. You made me believe that my presence here was
                        agreeable to you, and I really thought that I had made a deep impression
                        upon your innocent heart. As for your fool of a brother--"</p>
                    <p>"Stop, sir!" cried Kate in a voice that it did me good to hear. "I thought
                        you were a gentleman and treated you civilly. I am sorry now that I did so,
                        and hope you will take yourself away and not again offend us. Since you so
                        sadly misconstrue your reception here it is necessary to speak plainly."</p>
                    <p>"You are quite tragic, upon my soul you are," Vawter said, with a laugh hard
                        and malicious. "How would you treat me if I were one John Trenham, the bold
                        moss-trooper who, with the raider Morgan's other bandits and red-hands, will
                        come to cut all our throats to-morrow?"</p>
                    <p>At this my anger rose afresh, and before I could <pb id="VAA3892-197" n="186"
                        /> recollect myself I had slipped my sword from its scabbard, though without
                        serious thought as to what I should do with it. Kate was facing the place
                        where I stood, but Vawter's back was toward me. In my excitement I had
                        momentarily brought my face into the light, and in that moment her eyes met
                        mine. She turned as pale as death and put her hand on the porch railing as
                        if for support, but retained her presence of mind.</p>
                    <p>"Ah! That touches you, does it?" Vawter added, seeing her emotion and
                        supposing that it was caused by his last remarks.</p>
                    <p>"Go!" said Kate, straightening herself and pointing toward the gate.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, you order me away as though I were a contraband nigger. I will go, of
                        course, but let me first tell you --"</p>
                    <p>"Go, go, as you value your life," she said again, for she saw the gleaming of
                        a naked sword blade through the syringa leaves.</p>
                    <p>He moved slowly toward the steps. "I don't appreciate the force of your
                        threat, Miss Bellray, since that copperhead brother of yours has sufficient
                        reason for keeping to his bed."</p>
                    <p>He paused, and removing his hat, bowed low with mock civility. "I was just
                        going to say when you interrupted me, that Captain Trenham will doubtless
                        dangle from a limb in the courthouse yard at Corydon before another twelve
                            <pb id="VAA3892-198" n="187"/> hours have passed. Take that for a
                        night-cap, my imperious lady."</p>
                    <p>Kate fell back as from a blow, and clutched one of the supporting pillars
                        where she stood with wide eyes and heaving breast, while Vawter, having
                        delivered himself of his cowardly speech, went deliberately down the steps.
                        Reaching the bottom, he half turned about as if to say more, and his eyes
                        fell upon me. I had stepped out into the light from the darkness that had
                        concealed me, for I could endure his insolence to this unprotected girl no
                        longer.</p>
                    <p>"Hound!" said I, forgetting myself and striking him smartly across the face
                        with my open hand, "so I must chastise you twice within the hours of a day.
                        Now do as Miss Bellray bade you--begone!"</p>
                    <p>He took a step backward, looking at me wickedly.</p>
                    <p>" 'Hound,' and 'begone,' is it, Captain Trenham? Those are words used with
                        dogs, but do not forget that dogs can bite."</p>
                    <p>Then without another word, but with a malignant scowl on his face, he went
                        down the walk. When he reached the shadows he stopped and half drew from his
                        pocket a pistol, but, reconsidering, went on.</p>
                    <p>When Vawter had gone away I put him entirely out of my mind and turned toward
                        Kate, who gave me her hand when I got to her at the <pb id="VAA3892-199"
                            n="188"/> door where she was now standing. The welcome she gave me was
                        not formal, for the unusual circumstances of our meeting forbade that, but
                        there was a constraint of manner that made me uncomfortable. And when we
                        went into the house, as we did immediately, neither of us seemed to know
                        precisely what to say to the other.</p>
                    <p>I held my broad cavalry hat in my hand and was conscious of feeling awkward
                        and out of place. Kate appeared to be a little in fear of me, and in spite
                        of herself moved a step or two further away when, in the full light of the
                        room, her eyes rested on my gray, travel-stained uniform--the unmistakable
                        badge of a rebel in arms. As I saw this action I could not help smiling, and
                        said, for want of something better:</p>
                    <p>"I am not dangerous, Kate, nor did I garb myself to offend you; my visit to
                        you to-night was not long considered."</p>
                    <p>Realizing what she had done she came up to me and again held out her hand,
                        looking now only into my face.</p>
                    <p>"Forgive me," she said, simply; "you are the first real rebel that I have
                        seen, and I was trying hard to persuade myself to be frightened, which was
                        very ridiculous in me, of course, seeing that it is only you. But you know
                        what I have always thought."</p>
                    <p>"I have never for a moment forgotten it, but <pb id="VAA3892-200" n="189"/>
                        we will not let that trouble us now," said I, desiring to get away from this
                        old, dangerous ground. "Tell me about Roger."</p>
                    <p>"Then you have heard about it?"</p>
                    <p>"Only that something very strange had taken place. I came to see my mother
                        and found her uneasy and disturbed about your family on account of things
                        that she had heard over this way. She herself will see you in the morning.
                        What has happened?"</p>
                    <p>She briefly, and with some agitation as the events of the past hours were
                        recalled, narrated the story that I have already outlined.</p>
                    <p>"They thought he was dead, and so did we all until he was carried into the
                        house. Then it was discovered that he was breathing, and he soon returned to
                        consciousness but showed traces of delirium. We sent for Dr. White who found
                        that the bullet that struck him in the head had made only a glancing wound.
                        He has two other injuries but they also, thank God, are superficial. He is
                        sleeping now. Dr. White thinks he may be able to travel, but says that he
                        should remain at home, which under the circumstances is impossible.
                        Information that he is alive will get abroad and his enemies will finish the
                        work they have begun if he does not go away. Oh, it is all so dreadful, so
                        dreadful!"</p>
                    <p>She went to the window and looked out into <pb id="VAA3892-201" n="190"/> the
                        darkness through the blurring tears that filled her eyes. I went over and
                        stood beside her, my heart swelling with a great pity and tenderness-- aye,
                        and much more than that. For a little time we were both silent, then she
                        turned her face toward mine, hastily wiping away the tears.</p>
                    <p>"What shall I do?" she asked chokingly. "I have no one to advise me. Roger is
                        utterly without friends here who would aid him excepting those who hold
                        views like his own, and I will never call upon them--never!"</p>
                    <p>"I am only a rebel, Kate, with a leave of absence from my command that will
                        expire in two hours, but I will help you if I can. Roger must not stay here;
                        if he is able let him go with me."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, no, no!" she exclaimed. "He must not do that--he never, I am sure,
                        thought of going so far. It is enough that--" She stopped suddenly, confused
                        and disconcerted.</p>
                    <p>"It is enough that I am a rebel," said I, finishing her sentence. "I am glad
                        to hear you say that, for it shows that you have thought of me, even though
                        you have done it reproachfully. But I did not mean that he should link
                        himself to the precarious fortunes of the Confederate soldiery, as I have
                        done. Show me the way and we will go and talk with him about it. We need
                        disturb him only a moment."</p>
                    <p>No definite plan whereby I could aid her brother had occurred to me; but an
                        idea that he <pb id="VAA3892-202" n="191"/> might be carried along with our
                        forces as an ostensible prisoner or something of the kind had partially
                        formed itself in my mind. Beyond that I could see no way just then, and the
                        scheme was so poor and weak that I did not mention it to Kate, hoping that
                        after consulting with Roger some better arrangement might be suggested.</p>
                    <p>In the matter of taking and giving blows I could bear my share, but to get
                        this man away from the reach of his enemies without compromising him still
                        more in their sight required a delicate strategy in which I felt that I
                        would be little better than a blunderer. And yet if the situation was as bad
                        as his sister believed it to be he must be taken away, whatever might
                        befall.</p>
                    <p>We went up the stairs, Kate's arm through mine, her hand resting confidingly
                        on the traitorous cloth of which my sleeve was made. At the head of the
                        stairs we met Mrs. Willing, who, on seeing me, started back with an
                        exclamation of fright, as if I had been some horrible specter.</p>
                    <p>"It is only Captain Trenham, Aunt Sarah," said Kate, reassuringly.</p>
                    <p>"And I thank heaven that it is only you, Mr. Trenham," she returned, her face
                        lighting up in recognition. "Whatever else you may be you are our
                        friend--that we know--and we are in great fear and distress." Then she
                        turned to Kate. "Oh, my poor, poor child, how tired you look."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-203" n="192"/>
                    <p>After a word or two she passed on down the stairs, and we entered Roger's
                        room, where we found him reclining on a couch, fully dressed but looking
                        pale and inert. He had had no warning of my presence in the house, but
                        showed no surprise on seeing me. As I entered, he got upon his feet from
                        instinctive courtesy, and came forward to meet me, moving unsteadily. In the
                        middle of the room he reeled as from dizziness or weakness, and would have
                        fallen had I not hurried to his support and led him back to the couch.</p>
                    <p>"I am all right, John," he said, smiling vacantly. "I rose too quickly and it
                        made my head swim a little, that's all. I think I fell from my horse coming
                        from town, didn't I, Kate? He must have shied at something. I heard in the
                        town that Lincoln had been elected. If that is true it will make a lot of
                        trouble, John--maybe bring war. Douglas should have been chosen."</p>
                    <p>I turned from Roger and looked at Kate. A deep pallor was on her face and the
                        hand that lay in her lap trembled. This was not delirium; it was different
                        from the vagaries of fever and had root in a deeper cause. I remembered
                        hearing it told how, coming from the town where he had gone to learn the
                        result of the last presidential election, he had received an injury that was
                        supposed to have been caused by a fall from his horse, and was brought home
                        senseless. He had speedily recovered, however, and his sister, then at <pb
                            id="VAA3892-204" n="193"/> school, was not sent for. But now he was
                        living in that period again, and all subsequent things, as it turned out,
                        were to him as if they had never been.</p>
                    <p>"They need not have sent for you, Kate; it is nothing at all serious--why,
                        child, how you have grown! You are almost a woman now--strange that I didn't
                        notice it before--and you look so much like our mother. Well, now that you
                        are here you can stay until after the holidays. And, John, I hadn't heard
                        that you had come home. You look strong and rugged--French living has agreed
                        with you, boy, but if that is the kind of uniform they dressed you in over
                        there they have poor taste; there is nothing to equal American blue. I have
                        not seen your father since I was hurt; how is he?"</p>
                    <p>My father, who was ill at the time of Roger's former injury, had been dead
                        for nearly three years, but I could not bring myself to say so. Before I
                        could formulate a satisfactory answer he went on:</p>
                    <p>"The election will sorely disappoint him. He favored Breckinridge, you know.
                        The people ought to have chosen Douglas--a man in no sense a radical--and he
                        would have found a way to avert the trouble that is threatening us. Pardon
                        me, but I feel tired and think I can sleep a little. Ride over to-morrow.
                        Good-night."</p>
                    <p>He lay back wearily on his pillow, closed his <pb id="VAA3892-205" n="194"/>
                        eyes and seemed to be oblivious of his surroundings. But in a moment he
                        roused and spoke his sister's name. She bent over him, putting her hand on
                        his troubled head.</p>
                    <p>"I find that I am very weak; have I been ill long?"</p>
                    <p>Kate hesitated about her answer and looked at me. I nodded my head
                        affirmatively, thinking that he might be comforted.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, my brother; you have been ill a long time," she said.</p>
                    <p>"I thought it must be so," he returned faintly.</p>
                    <p>And thus we left him, as completely separated from recent events as if the
                        shot fired by the horse-buyer had taken fatal effect. Only time could tell
                        how long the affliction would last, but while it endured he was safe from
                        the troubles that had beset him. No need to think now of removing him or of
                        devising other schemes for his safety, and while it grieved me much to see
                        him so, I felt relieved of a disagreeble and delicate responsibility.</p>
                    <p>As we went down, the tall clock in the angle of the stairs marked the quarter
                        before three. The short night was nearly at an end, and I had a good twelve
                        miles to ride. I should have gone at once, but could not do so without
                        stopping to speak to Kate some words of encouragement about her brother.</p>
                    <p>Then Vawter came again into my mind and I <pb id="VAA3892-206" n="195"/>
                        inquired as to his relations with Roger, learning that he had been
                        frequently at the house, sometimes coming with Roger's friends and sometimes
                        alone. Kate said that her brother had latterly spoken of the man as if
                        suspicious of him. Beyond this she knew nothing of him or his purposes and I
                        did not enlighten her as to the little that I knew. For it was little to be
                        sure, yet sufficient, taken with what she had told me, to satisfy me that he
                        had in some way been involved in Roger's misfortune.</p>
                    <p>On her part, Kate steadily refrained from asking questions concerning myself.
                        I was alive and well--that she could see--and if she were interested in
                        anything else that had happened to me since I had last seen her she did not
                        indicate it by words. But her manner, I thought, told as much as language
                        could.</p>
                    <p>In the presence of the night's increasing terrors she now saw only
                        individuals and effects; principles and causes were put out of sight, if not
                        forgotten. Her spirit was not broken, only depressed. She seemed not to
                        think whether my coat was gray or blue, nor to care whether it was
                        emblematic of the cause of the North or of the South.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Willing, after a little time, had gone and left us together. She had
                        said that I was a friend, whatever else I might be. And when she had taken
                        herself away I confessed to the one who remained <pb id="VAA3892-207"
                            n="196"/> how it was with me--how much more than a friend I would be to
                        her if she would let me. Her distress, her appeal to me for aid, her
                        manifest disposition to overlook, at least for the time, my part in the
                        invasion (for she had not yet once referred to it) all conspired to drive me
                        on to a declaration of my feelings.</p>
                    <p>Then it was that she seemed to awaken as if from a benumbing dream. Her
                        figure straightened, her face flushed and her eyes were alight with the old
                        fire. I felt my heart sink like lead in my bosom before she had uttered a
                        word, and I inwardly cursed the haste that had seemingly ruined my hope.</p>
                    <p>"Sir, in my troubles I had forgotten who you were and thought of you only as
                        one in whom I might trust. Now I remember that you came as an enemy, with an
                        army about you, to trample upon us and drive us from our homes under the
                        lead of your desperate chief. Return to him and tell him that we are
                        defenseless, and pray him to finish his work of fire and blood quickly. Oh!
                        why did you bring him here? Why didn't you take him elsewhere?"</p>
                    <p>"In God's name, stop, Kate," said I, wounded to the heart. "If I could laugh
                        now, I would laugh at your questions. <hi rend="i">I</hi> bring my General
                        here or take him elsewhere? He goes where he pleases, and I am only a humble
                        follower of as brave and knightly a soldier as ever drew sword. <pb
                            id="VAA3892-208" n="197"/> He makes war only upon those who oppose him
                        with arms, and he comes here with as good a right as that which sends your
                        Sheridan and his men through the southern country."</p>
                    <p>"Perhaps it is so; I understand little about such things, and this general of
                        yours is held in terror, justly or unjustly. I do not want to hurt you, for
                        you have always been good and kind to me. But I am so miserable and unhappy.
                        I have borne so much." She took a tottering step toward me. "Oh, John, had
                        you come under any other circumstances I might have talked differently. When
                        you come again--"</p>
                    <p>"--If I ever do," I interrupted, bitterly, feeling that I did not care if I
                        should never come again.</p>
                    <p>'What do you mean by that?" she asked, gaspingly, her eyes wide and
                        staring.</p>
                    <p>"My life is full of perils and they will now thicken about me. Our way lies
                        through our enemies' country and we can have no support from our friends.
                        Overwhelming numbers will be thrown against us, but we shall not flinch nor
                        turn back. Pardon me, Kate, for opening my heart to you; the things that I
                        told you have burdened me long. I couldn't help it. But I realize now, when
                        it is too late, that I made a mistake, and it only remains for me to leave."
                        I said a word of farewell and turned to go.</p>
                    <p>"Wait, John," she cried; "you must not go <pb id="VAA3892-209" n="198"/>
                        without knowing. I can not deceive you longer-- I am not strong enough. Oh,
                        don't you see that I love you, my dear, and that my heart, which has
                        followed you longingly all these awful months, is breaking for you now?"</p>
                    <p>In a moment she was in my arms, and though I were a thousand times a rebel it
                        would, she presently admitted, have been the same.</p>

                    <p>F<hi rend="sc">OR</hi> a time, in my happiness, I forgot everything else, and
                        small wonder it was. But the flight of the clock's hands around the dial
                        plate did not cease, and time, which had stood still while the favored
                        Joshua fought a battle, did not wait upon my love-making. I was startled at
                        last by hearing the hour of four strike, and by observing that dawn had
                        come. I had overstayed my leave and would be held remiss in my duty, but I
                        did not doubt that I could make satisfactory excuses to the General. With
                        quickly spoken words of farewell I took my departure.</p>
                    <p>As upon the preceding morning a heavy fog hung over the face of the earth,
                        and the hour being early it was almost impenetrable to the sight. Objects a
                        hundred feet away were hidden as effectually as if they did not exist. It
                        was a good half hour before sunrise, and the fog would last sometime after
                        that. Without a knowledge of the country the task before me would be both
                        difficult and dangerous. But, knowing the directions well and having a fair
                        acquaintance with the <pb id="VAA3892-211" n="200"/> roads, I had little to
                        fear unless I encountered the enemy's scouts or belated companies of
                        legionaries hastening to repel the invader. As an extra precaution I made a
                        wide detour to the westward, riding along at a hard gallop.</p>
                    <p>Voices coming through the mist at intervals on both sides of the road, where
                        I judged houses to be, proved that the populace was awake. Now and then I
                        would hear the rumble of wheels and the hammering of horses' feet and would
                        presently come upon a wagon carrying a family fleeing from the path of the
                        raider. Past these I would dash at speed, and, if hailed, make no
                        response.</p>
                    <p>Nearly half of my journey had been accomplished when the increased light
                        showed that the sun was rising. Objects were discernible at a greater
                        distance, and it became clear that the mist would be rapidly evaporated. I
                        pushed ahead with accelerated speed, the horse--a fresh one that I had
                        obtained from my mother's stable --responding with spirit to every
                        unaccustomed touch of my heavy war spurs.</p>
                    <p>So far, my course had been taken along a route which subjected me to slight
                        chance of interruption. And after a while, believing that I was beyond any
                        possible outposts of the legionaries, who had been reported to us the night
                        before as concentrating at Corydon, I cut boldly across toward the Mauckport
                        road, by which I knew it was the General's purpose to move upon the
                        town.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-212" n="201"/>
                    <p>A brisk ride of a quarter of an hour brought me to this road, and I turned
                        south. The Confederate advance, if it had maintained its position, was less
                        than four miles away. The light in the east had changed from a grayish white
                        to a golden yellow, and the tops of the trees were gleaming in the sun's
                        rays. A thin veil of mist still clung sullenly to the ground, as if
                        determined to oppose to the last the batteries of its powerful enemy.</p>
                    <p>I had pursued the Mauckport road a mile or more when several horsemen broke
                        suddenly from concealment behind some willows at the roadside, and barred my
                        progress. I was moving at a gait that carried me into the midst of the party
                        before I could check and turn my horse, or draw a weapon to defend myself.
                        One of the men seized my bridle rein near the bit and clung on, while the
                        others presented their pistols and commanded me to yield. Resistance was
                        folly unless I was tired of living--and I had more cause for wanting to live
                        now than ever before--so I submitted with the best grace possible, which was
                        poor enough. I was at once deprived of my pistols, but my sword was not
                        taken from me.</p>
                    <p>At the first onset I had recognized Vawter as one of my captors, and the face
                        of the man who seemed to be the leader among them had a familiar look. Like
                        a flash it came to me that this was the man of Colonel Mandrell's house--he
                        of <pb id="VAA3892-213" n="202"/> the stubby mustache and the manner of a
                        sergeant of police--the renowned Captain Bracken himself. That there was no
                        mistake about it was proved when he presently addressed me.</p>
                    <p>"I am glad to see you again, Captain Trenham --for I understand that you have
                        achieved such a distinction since our last meeting," said he, in high good
                        humor.</p>
                    <p>"I can not say as much of you, sir," I retorted savagely.</p>
                    <p>Bracken laughed. "You are excused, under the circumstances, from returning
                        the compliment," he said. "A considerable indebtedness is owing to this
                        gentleman"--indicating Vawter-- "for your company this morning, Captain,
                        though the debt should be reduced by half because of the devil of a wait we
                        have had, expecting every minute to have some of your fellows down upon us.
                        It will take many a mile out of this to make me feel right and drive the
                        chills from my back."</p>
                    <p>What was intended for a tantalizing smile disfigured Vawter's face as he
                        looked at me.</p>
                    <p>"The captain no doubt found excellent entertainment where he was," he said
                        with an insinuating smirk that made my blood boil; but I said nothing,
                        feeling that I could not trust myself to make a rejoinder.</p>
                    <p>Bracken gave the word to move on, and the party started toward the south, two
                        men besides the leader and Vawter, riding in front, and two <pb
                            id="VAA3892-214" n="203"/> more, completing the number, bringing up the
                        rear. In a short time we reached a road running to the right, and into it we
                        turned, excepting Vawter, who went straight ahead as if his part of the work
                        had been accomplished. We had traveled the westerly road several minutes at
                        a rapid pace when it seemed to occur to Bracken to hold further conversation
                        with me; he dropped back and thudded along by my side, checking the pace in
                        order that he might talk more at his ease.</p>
                    <p>"I really don't know that there is anything against you, Captain, other than
                        being a rebel," he began. "When you fell into my hands at Louisville--the
                        time you gave me the slip, you remember--you had entered a trap that was not
                        baited for you, and I detained you, or rather it was my purpose to detain
                        you, on suspicion. And now, as I do not want to return emptyhanded and can't
                        very well take along a dead man, I jumped at the chance that fellow gave me
                        to get you. It was a slim chance, though, for you might have taken some
                        other road."</p>
                    <p>I had already condemned myself for not taking another road, but I cast the
                        subject from my mind as vain punishment. What struck me sharply was the
                        other's belief that Roger Bellray was really dead, and I wondered what
                        purpose Vawter could have in withholding the truth. Let it be what it might,
                        I put that one thing to his credit.</p>
                    <p>"Why do you take me?" I asked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-215" n="204"/>
                    <p>"It is always in order to capture the enemy, especially when he is one of
                        Morgan's men, who make no end of trouble and are as slippery as eels,"
                        Bracken answered, easily. "Besides, I have never forgotten how you fooled me
                        that other time, and I don't quite understand yet how you did it. You no
                        doubt think I should have let you take your chances with the legionaries and
                        that I have gone out of my line of service, but I am glad to have something
                        to show for two days of hellishly disagreeable work."</p>
                    <p>"But I will certainly be exchanged soon, at any rate; is it not so?"</p>
                    <p>"No, I think not; you see our folks got so many rebs when Pemberton
                        surrendered Vicks-burg and when Lee got licked at Gettysburg that the
                        government will be compelled to suspend the cartel providing for exchanges.
                        Quite likely you'll not get out till the war is over."</p>
                    <p>This was very gloomy news, but if a military prison was to be my fate I must
                        of necessity bear it. Yet my mind, which had already been busy with thoughts
                        of escape, must be kept wide awake to any opportunity that might offer to
                        such end. I determined that for the present it would be best to appear to
                        accept my misfortune in good spirit.</p>
                    <p>"That is a hard situation for an active man to face," I said, "but if it
                        comes to me I will try to endure it. By the way, how does it come that you
                        let Vawter go back to General Morgan?"</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-216" n="205"/>
                    <p>"Vawter? His name is Vawter, is it? Well, he may be useful to the General,''
                        and he laughed.</p>
                    <p>"Or to his Unionist employers," I added, to which observation the other made
                        no reply save by a shrug of his muscular shoulders. Seeing that he was
                        disinclined to continue the subject I let it drop without further
                        comment.</p>
                    <p>Up to this time I had given no particular attention to any of the party
                        excepting the two principals. I had seen enough of the two men in front to
                        know that they were entire strangers to me, and I now turned to look at the
                        remaining two, trailing a hundred feet or more behind. One of them was
                        unknown, but I was astonished to see that the other was the horse-buyer,
                        whose features I had overlooked in the excitement attending my capture.
                        Without intimating that I recognized the man, I asked Captain Bracken, who
                        seemed inclined to be talkative in non-essentials:</p>
                    <p>"Who is the man behind, to the left?"</p>
                    <p>Bracken glanced backward. "That is a great coward and blunderer," he
                        answered, a frown settling on his face. "His name is Spilker, or some such
                        thing as that."</p>
                    <p>"Why do you say he is a coward and blunderer?"</p>
                    <p>"Because there are times when it is actually a pleasure to speak the truth.
                        That fellow disobeyed my orders and killed the man I wanted to arrest. Now
                        he's afraid to stay and face the <pb id="VAA3892-217" n="206"/> music;
                        swears the man's friends will hunt him out and kill him. And I have no doubt
                        they would, but it would be small loss."</p>
                    <p>He spoke coolly and with an entire lack of feeling, beyond disappointment at
                        his failure to get the man.</p>
                    <p>"Does he belong to your party?"</p>
                    <p>"Him? Not much; he belonged to a small company of what he called independent
                        home-guards who mostly deserted him after he killed the man, and I believe
                        wouldn't have much to do with him before. I am merely giving him a chance to
                        get out of the country."</p>
                    <p>"Who was the man that was killed?" I asked, for his blunt way of answering my
                        questions interested me.</p>
                    <p>The captain evidently believed that he had said enough, for instead of making
                        any response he put spurs to his horse and resumed his place in front. When
                        a half hour afterward the distant report of a cannon was heard over Corydon
                        way he turned in his saddle and shouted back at me:</p>
                    <p>"Your friends are beginning operations early this morning."</p>
                    <p>"So it seems," said I. For the first time that sound saddened me, and struck
                        upon my ears more as a knell than as a gage of battle.</p>
                    <p>An hour's ride from the Mauckport road brought our party to the Ohio river
                        somewhat to the north <pb id="VAA3892-218" n="207"/> of the village of New
                        Amsterdam. At this point the great water-course runs to the north for a
                        distance of several miles, then strikes off to the northwest, passing the
                        river town of Leavenworth, and shortly beyond that makes a sharp bend and
                        abruptly turns back upon itself, flowing southeastward many miles before it
                        resumes its general course toward the mighty Mississippi.</p>
                    <p>Thus a sharp Kentucky peninsula, in shape like a gigantic thumb, was created
                        by the boundary makers and sandwiched between two Indiana shore lines. Half
                        way between the two towns mentioned, on the northern side, was an obscure
                        and little used landing, where steamboats, passing up or down the river,
                        would stop for passengers or freight only on being signaled to do so. For
                        some reason Captain Bracken preferred this landing to the more public
                        stopping places, and our small cavalcade headed northward, following the
                        stream as closely as was possible.</p>
                    <p>Whether the news of the invasion had frightened the inhabitants of the region
                        away, or whether other causes kept them out of sight, could not be told. But
                        certain it is that the few houses which we passed showed no signs of human
                        occupancy. Here and there a dog had run out and barked at our heels, but his
                        master's presence was not disclosed. Domestic fowls cackled and quacked
                        about the door-yards, and cows, unmilked and discontented, were heard mooing
                        at <pb id="VAA3892-219" n="208"/> pasture bars, but neither housewife nor
                        milkmaid nor barefoot urchin came into view.</p>
                    <p>I noted the difference between this condition and that which existed in the
                        country further north as I passed through it earlier in the morning. These
                        people had surely fled the day before and had not yet returned, while the
                        voices heard through the matin fog were, as I had already concluded, of
                        those actually deserting or making early and hurried preparations to desert
                        their homes before the onward march of my General.</p>
                    <p>But these things occupied less of my thoughts than did plans for escaping
                        from my captors, chances to do which had so far seemed slim and
                        discouraging. Bracken's statement about the suspension of exchanges filled
                        me with dismay. It meant confinement, possibly, as he had said, until the
                        close of the war, even if I should be compelled to face no more serious
                        charge than that of being a soldier of the enemy. Except for this
                        disheartening prospect, and a feeling of chagrin that I had stumbled so
                        readily into the net that Vawter had spread for me, I was not sorry to be
                        relieved from any participation in the morning's work, of which that thunder
                        of the cannon had given warning.</p>
                    <p>Our progress was made slow by the rough nature of the country we were
                        traversing, but by eight o'clock we had reached a bluff overlooking the
                        landing. Here we drew rein and scanned the <pb id="VAA3892-220" n="209"/>
                        river. No boats were plying its waters in the immediate vicinity, but the
                        smoke of steamers was distinctly visible toward Leavenworth. Whether they
                        were going down or coming up the stream was for a time doubtful.</p>
                    <p>Presently, however, we made out that a white-hulled little vessel was coming
                        fussily our way, with much churning of the water and a display of smoke out
                        of all proportion to the size of the craft. Captain Bracken brought forth
                        from somewhere a small glass and after leveling it on the boat appeared to
                        be greatly pleased with the result of his inspection.</p>
                    <p>"We are in luck; that is a Louisville packet, and it seems to be in a nasty
                        hurry, too," he said, lowering the glass. "Now, how do we get down to that
                        accursed landing?"</p>
                    <p>He looked about him for the road and discovered it winding down from the
                        heights more than half a mile away. Its distance put him in something of a
                        temper.</p>
                    <p>"Damnation! If we go that way we'll miss the boat. Here, Spiker," he called
                        out to the fugitive. "You ought to know this place, and are interested in
                        getting away from it. How can we get down without going the road?"</p>
                    <p>"My name is not Spiker," said the horse-buyer, with a flash of spirit.</p>
                    <p>"Who cares what it is? Catch that boat for us <pb id="VAA3892-221" n="210"/>
                        and I'll willingly call you Napoleon Bonaparte or anything you choose."</p>
                    <p>"I've never tried it," said Spelker, sullenly, "but I know a place where I
                        think it can be done," and he started off, the rest of us following.</p>
                    <p>Soon he stopped at a point almost opposite the coveted landing--coveted by
                        the others, not by me--where there was a break in the limestone bluff
                        constituting a steep, irregular ravine, through which, in wet seasons,
                        surface water no doubt found its way to the river. Judging from signs, a
                        considerable torrent more than once had rushed and roared between these
                        jagged walls, but at this time the gorge was perfectly dry. It seemingly was
                        no great undertaking for men on foot to attempt a descent here, but it was
                        not so with horses, being for a part of the way uneven and in places almost
                        precipitous.</p>
                    <p>A third of the way down the stone walls fell away, and a little further on
                        was what appeared to be a rumpled bank of earth evidently caused by washings
                        from the high ground. At that point the occasional torrent was turned to the
                        right by this obstruction, running in a narrow channel between overhanging
                        ledges of rock on one side and the dangerous-looking bank of clay on the
                        other. What was beyond that I could not see. I have been thus particular in
                        description because of the extraordinary thing that happened to me
                        there.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-222" n="211"/>
                    <p>"Here we are," said Spelker. "Once through that cut down there and it will be
                        smooth enough.''</p>
                    <p>Bracken surveyed the ground dubiously, but he was in a hurry and apparently
                        resolved to risk breaking all of our necks and those of the horses as well
                        rather than to miss the packet. Ordering everybody to dismount, he put all
                        the animals except Spelker's in charge of two of the men and started them
                        down the gorge; Spelker was expected to look after his own horse.</p>
                    <p>"You are next, Mr. Spiker, and Captain Trenham will follow you," said
                        Bracken, who with one of his men, was to come behind.</p>
                    <p>In that order the start was made. The men with the horses had almost reached
                        the turn when we began our descent, and soon disappeared. On getting to the
                        turn I saw them making good progress ahead of us where the channel seemed to
                        end on a gently sloping plateau. Captain Bracken and the others were
                        stumbling along as much as thirty feet behind me.</p>
                    <p>Spelker and I had made the turn, I close upon his heels, and gone some yards,
                        when suddenly his horse, which he was leading by the bit, gave a snort of
                        fright and with a bound broke away from him. Instantly the earth seemed to
                        open under his feet, and he went downward and out of sight. I had no time to
                        take a step backward or even to utter a cry before I also went down. Then
                        came a crushing, thunderous noise above.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-223" n="212"/>
                    <p>The fall was not to a great depth, and was deadened by the earth that had
                        given way under me.</p>
                    <p>On striking, I felt a shower of earth and gravel falling upon and around me,
                        and then had a momentary sensation of trying to balance my body and failing.
                        I rolled to one side, and over and over down a smooth incline for a distance
                        that seemed unending until I reached another level that enabled me to stop
                        my uncomfortable flight. A rattling noise as of pebbles bounding along a
                        hard surface had accompanied me to the bottom, and they still came down as I
                        rose to my feet, bruised, half-stunned, but not seriously injured.</p>
                    <p>I was in pitch blackness, and could only tell the direction from which I had
                        come by the occasional falling of the pebbles, and by hearing far above the
                        awful creeping and sifting sound of settling earth. Feeling my way
                        cautiously to the foot of the incline I looked upward, but no ray of light
                        greeted my eyes. I stepped upon something soft, and putting my hand down
                        found that it was a hat, still warm from the head of the wearer. I put it
                        on.</p>
                    <p>Where was Spelker? I spoke the man's name but there was no answer save the
                        echo of my own voice, which repeated and reiterated the name from hollow,
                        immeasurable distances. Sitting down on the stony floor I rested for a
                        little time, and then on my hands and knees began to ascend the incline. The
                        work was slow and exhausting. <pb id="VAA3892-224" n="[]"/>

                        <pb id="VAA3892-225" n="213"/> In places where water had seeped through from
                        above the stones were slimy with the drip, and afforded no hold either for
                        hand or foot. Many times I slipped back a part of the way, but finding a
                        drier spot would go on again.</p>
                    <p>At last I reached a ledge barely wide enough to give me comfortable sitting
                        room. Drawing myself up on this that I might recover the breath which my
                        labors had well-nigh deprived me of, I realized that it was here where I had
                        first fallen. But now, save where I sat, the place was heaped with earth and
                        rock. Getting carefully to my feet and feeling about me, I found that the
                        opening had been closed by the falling of great masses of limestone, crowded
                        and wedged tightly together, with every crack and crevice filled with soil
                        and sand.</p>
                    <p>Through that terrible pile no sound from the outer world could penetrate.
                        What folly to try the strength of my voice against that entombing heap! I
                        judged that a part of the wall of the gorge had been loosened by the washing
                        storms of centuries, and upon the yielding of the cavern's mouth had tumbled
                        down its countless tons to hide the secret over which it had so long stood,
                        guard.</p>
                    <p>I again seated myself on the ledge to consider my situation. And then I
                        remembered that before leaving my mother's house, she had, along with other
                        small articles, provided me with a box of <pb id="VAA3892-226" n="214"/>
                        matches, which I had put in my coat pocket. I began a search for these,
                        suddenly fearful that I had lost them, but they were still secure. Lighting
                        one I looked around as far as its blaze enabled me. Nothing that I had not
                        previously discovered was revealed--but hold! Just as it flickered out
                        something flashed a little further along the ledge.</p>
                    <p>Moving toward the spot, I struck another match, and there, in the circle of
                        light made by its small flame, lay a large, muscular human hand, with a
                        gaudy ring on one of its stiffening fingers. Tons of stone and earth
                        concealed the arm and body to which that hand belonged, but I knew that it
                        was Spelker's.</p>
                    <p>A shudder passed through me, and I became faint and dizzy. What had saved my
                        life? Spelker had fallen first, and in the natural order of things it seemed
                        that I, and not the other, would have been crushed under that mighty weight.
                        Only the providence which had thrown me over the ledge and sent me rolling
                        down the incline in the very nick of time had saved me from the horrible
                        fate that had overtaken the horse-buyer.</p>
                    <p>I had seen many men killed and maimed in battle, but that was in the open
                        air, with the sky above and the fever of conflict rioting in my veins, and
                        with life and motion as well as death everywhere about. Here I was alone, in
                        darkness as absolute and stillness as complete as that of the <pb
                            id="VAA3892-227" n="215"/> grave, and shut off from everything human
                        save that ghastly hand, which seemed to reach out to me for help that I
                        could not give.</p>
                    <p>What wonder then, that, strong as I was, and brave as I held myself to be,
                        for a little time I was like one undone. But at last I pulled myself
                        together and set to work to determine the extent of my difficulties. It was
                        not worth while to make further investigation where I was. If there was
                        another way by which I could regain the outer world, it must be found before
                        death or madness robbed me of the power of trying.</p>
                    <p>Feeling around, my hand came into contact with a large tuft of dry grass that
                        had fallen from the surface. Applying a match to this, a light was made that
                        revealed a slightly arching roof eight or ten feet above my head and
                        extending out over the blackness below. The incline I judged to be as much
                        as twenty feet wide, with natural stone walls on each side.</p>
                    <p>What surprised me greatly, at the same time giving me a feeling of hope, was
                        to see, next to the wall on my right, a regular flight of steps leading
                        downward, and apparently cut into the solid rock. Moving nearer, my
                        astonishment was increased, for this could be no accidental stairway. It was
                        designed by human brains and worked out by human hands. But when were these
                        brains active and when had these hands chiseled and wrought? Everything
                        served to <pb id="VAA3892-228" n="216"/> show that it must have been ages
                        upon ages before.</p>
                    <p>The steps were worn as if by the long-continued passage of feet through
                        unnumbered centuries, and the wall, at the height of four or five feet from
                        each step, was smooth, as if here human hands had been put to steady the
                        descent of those who had made use of the regions below. Either the stairway
                        had been used moderately for thousands of years, or else mighty and
                        unremittent hosts for a lesser period had gone down this stony way and up
                        again.</p>
                    <p>I had barely time to observe these things-- which I did in a small fraction
                        of the time taken to relate them--when the grass burned out to the last root
                        and left me again in the darkness. Following the steps downward, counting
                        them as I went, and steadying myself against the wall, I at last reached the
                        level bottom where I had stood before. There were eighty-six steps, each of
                        them apparently nearly a foot high, but the declination was so gradual as to
                        make my descent comparatively easy.</p>
                    <p>What was now before me? What lay beyond this silent pall that covered me? I
                        struck a match and held it out at arm's length when I had reached what, to
                        the touch of my feet, appeared to be the end of the flight. The wall against
                        which I stood terminated a few feet further on, but, except that and the
                        smooth <pb id="VAA3892-229" n="217"/> ground extending about me, the feeble
                        rays disclosed nothing. If I could not find a substantial light I might as
                        well stay where I was and let that be the end of it. What had the former
                        occupants used? In the hope that they might have left behind something that
                        would serve me, I moved to the edge of the wall and lighted another match,
                        holding it toward the floor.</p>
                    <p>To my inexpressible joy I saw a heap of twisted canes a yard or so beyond the
                        angle of the wall, and near by were some bunches which were partly burned at
                        one end, showing the use to which they had been put. Picking up one of these
                        I soon had a brilliant blaze that illumined the cavern for many yards in all
                        directions. The first thing I did was to examine my treasure, which just
                        then was greater to me than tons of gold.</p>
                    <p>Each torch was about three feet long, and the sticks of cane of which it was
                        composed were so wrapped and twisted together as to best fit them for the
                        purpose for which they were designed. I observed that the torch in my hand,
                        while giving a fine light, was consumed very slowly. I had never seen this
                        species of cane, which was strongly resinous, and concluded that, like those
                        who had brought it here, it was extinct in the locality, or, what was more
                        likely, that it had been transported from another, and probably far distant
                        place.</p>

                    <p>W<hi rend="sc">ITH</hi> a torch in each hand and another one lighted and left
                        propped against the wall near the stairway, I started to explore my
                        immediate surroundings. The floor on which I trod was hard and smooth; the
                        roof was at least seventy feet above me, and the chamber itself, almost
                        circular in form, was more than one hundred yards in diameter. The air was
                        cool and pure.</p>
                    <p>So vast were the proportions of the room that, if it had been under the hills
                        of Granada, it might, according to Moorish legend, have held Boabdil and his
                        sleeping host. And what of those other mighty throngs who had filled it with
                        life and sound? From whence had they come and whither had they departed?
                        What scenes had these somber and voiceless walls witnessed, what sounds had
                        broken upon this eternal and earless rock? To what tongue had the
                        encrystalled dome given echo?</p>
                    <p>In what seemed to be the exact center of the chamber stood an immense
                        earthenware cauldron, or bowl, at least ten feet high and twelve across at
                            <pb id="VAA3892-231" n="219"/> the top and flat on the floor. On the
                        side toward the entrance was a series of stone steps reaching to within
                        three feet of its rim. Going up the steps I found that it was covered with a
                        lid that fitted tightly into the wide, grooved inner edge of its rim. The
                        lid was rounded and elevated in the middle. What was within this tremendous
                        utensil? What secret was here held and guarded? Unmindful for the moment
                        that I was apparently entombed in a more colossal receptacle, of somewhat
                        similar but vastly more durable structure, I forgot my peril and became
                        eager to see what had been here so carefully hidden.</p>
                    <p>An inspection of the lid disclosed a series of rings running around it,
                        beginning a foot from the edge and maintaining that distance apart to the
                        top. Looking closely at these marks, I saw that the covering of the bowl was
                        not made in one piece, as had at first seemed to be the fact, but in many
                        circular pieces, fitting snugly into each other and set in cement that
                        crumbled under the blade of my pocket knife. The piece capping the center of
                        the lid was about two feet in diameter, and if it should be removed the
                        inside of the vessel would be at the mercy of my eyes.</p>
                    <p>Drawing myself up, I crawled on my hands and knees to the rounded, knob-like
                        apex, which gave me leverage. Laying aside my torches, I took hold of the
                        knob with both hands, and exerting <pb id="VAA3892-232" n="220"/> all of my
                        strength succeeded in raising it a little. Resting a few minutes, I tried
                        again and this time lifted the center piece from the groove in which it was
                        set, and moved it aside.</p>
                    <p>For a while I lacked the courage to look into the blackness below, but not
                        long did I hesitate. Taking up the torches, I leaned over and thrust one of
                        them through the opening and there held it. The whole of the interior was
                        lighted up and a low, involuntary ejaculation of amazement escaped me as the
                        golden mass, heaped almost to my hand, glittered in the flickering
                        torch-light.</p>
                    <p>Withdrawing the torch, I thrust in my hand and pulled it out full of the
                        perfect, shelled grains of maize, as fresh apparently as when first stored
                        in that secure granary. Here, no doubt, was kept the seed corn of that
                        far-back people who had frequented this mighty chamber. About it they had
                        held their harvest festivals and dancces. With what shouts and laughter had
                        each husbandman climbed to the top and poured in or taken out his allotted
                        share in harvest and seed time! Or if this conjecture be not admitted, was
                        it here, in this natural temple, that, driven to some sudden migration, they
                        had deposited and secured this grain with the hope of some day returning to
                        reclaim it and take up again their agricultural pursuits? What language did
                        they speak, of what appearance were they in form and face, after what
                        pattern was their dress fashioned? <pb id="VAA3892-233" n="221"/> It does
                        not matter; they were of peaceful and simple pursuits, and reckoned these
                        yellow grains as more precious than gold. Whence did they go on that last
                        journey? What transpired to detain them? Whither did they finally
                        vanish?</p>
                    <p>Though it involved some expenditure of strength, of which I might have need
                        before I was freed from my extraordinary imprisonment-- if, indeed, I should
                        be so fortunate as to attain that result--I replaced the section of the lid
                        that I had removed. A great respect for the strange people whose treasure
                        this had been possessed me, and it seemed to me that a neglect to do this
                        simple thing would have been a species of sacrilege.</p>
                    <p>Regaining the floor of the cavern I looked at my watch and found that it was
                        past ten o'clock. I took the precaution to wind the time-piece before
                        putting it back into my pocket, though day and night were the same here, and
                        the hours ticked off by it were frivolous things compared with the thousands
                        of years marked by the great urn beside me.</p>
                    <p>Determined to waste no more time, I began to make a diligent search of the
                        walls for an opening. I knew enough about caves in such formations as were
                        here shown to think that this immense chamber was probably connected with
                        others, though it was inconceivable that I should find another so vast. The
                        only known entrance <pb id="VAA3892-234" n="222"/> to the now celebrated
                        Wyandotte cave, then but little explored but since shown to be of wonderful
                        extent and beauty, was seven miles away. If there should be connection
                        between the two I might be able to make my way out, even if no other opening
                        should be found.</p>
                    <p>Beginning at the stairway, I followed the wall without result until I came to
                        a point almost opposite, where there was a break in the limestone several
                        feet wide. From here a passage led. Without stopping then to investigate its
                        character, I went on until the circumference of the room was completed and
                        discovered no other. Then selecting from the heap of torches as many as I
                        could conveniently carry, I made them into a bundle and tied them with one
                        of my suspenders. Thus equipped, I started on a pilgrimage the end of which
                        could not even be guessed.</p>
                    <p>Crossing the cavern floor, past the great lidded bowl, I found the passage on
                        the other side and plunged into it. Its floor was smooth and hard like that
                        of the great chamber, and, like it, bore testimony to the wear and pressure
                        of human feet. For a distance that I judged to be a furlong or more it ran
                        straight and true, but widened a little. Here it opened into another chamber
                        almost as large as the one I had quitted.</p>
                    <p>It was empty, save that in the center there stood what appeared to be an
                        altar made of blocks of stone. Ashes were upon its top, and toward <pb
                            id="VAA3892-235" n="223"/> the margins were pieces of wood, with charred
                        ends. What kind of rites were here observed? Were human beings sacrificed
                        here to propitiate some unknown god? Were captured enemies slain here to
                        celebrate a victory or to avenge a wrong? Was it here that the transgressor
                        was brought to expiate his sins in the flame? Or was this merely a place to
                        which the innocent dead were brought for sacred incremation? Raking in the
                        ashes with one of the sticks, I discovered nothing that would throw any
                        light on these inquiries. At the side of this chamber, at the mouth of what
                        seemed to be a passage-way, but which proved to be a small, natural chamber,
                        was a quantity of wood. Some distance from this was another small chamber, a
                        trifle larger than the first, which might have been a retiring room for the
                        priests.</p>
                    <p>Only a few minutes were devoted by me to these things; a few more spent in
                        examining the walls of the main chamber showed that there were two passages
                        close together running from it. Choosing the larger one at a hazard, I
                        pursued my way. This passage wound in and out, and in places was a mere
                        tortuous path, scarcely large enough to give walking room.</p>
                    <p>For an hour I stumbled through it, and at last, tired and covered with a cold
                        perspiration, came out into an immense arcade of great height and unknown
                        length. A roaring sound, somewhat <pb id="VAA3892-236" n="224"/> resembling
                        continuous thunder subdued by distance, greeted my ears.</p>
                    <p>As I went along I saw the bed of an ancient water-course, its bottom covered
                        with fine yellow sand. The worn surfaces of its sides showed that at one
                        time a considerable stream had flowed between them, but they were now
                        entirely dry. The sight reminded me that I was thirsty and I pushed on,
                        following the bank. The roaring sound increased as I advanced. In that
                        subterranean depth the noise, rapidly becoming more distinctly thunderous,
                        was less terrifying than the awful stillness through which I had thus far
                        journeyed.</p>
                    <p>I had probably walked almost a mile along the margin of the vanished river
                        when something white and high flashed in the rays of my torch. It was water
                        tumbling over a ledge fifty feet above where I stood. Going as near as I
                        dared I saw that the stream fell into a seething pit far below, where it
                        bubbled and foamed and hissed before disappearing into still lower
                        depths.</p>
                    <p>The falling water had seemingly broken through its original bed and found
                        here a new and subcavernous channel. With some difficulty and danger I got
                        into a position where I could reach the edge of the pouring torrent.
                        Removing my hat I held it out to catch some of the water, but as it came
                        before my eyes it dropped from my relaxing fingers into the hammering flood
                        beneath.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-237" n="225"/>
                    <p>The hat was not mine; it was the dead horse-buyer's. I drew back for a moment
                        to steady myself, but quickly recovering from the shock, I laid my torch on
                        the rock, and, making a cup of my two hands, drank my fill of the cold
                        water.</p>
                    <p>Then I did something extraordinary. I had for hours felt a desire to speak,
                        but that echo, which, when I had called Spelker, sent the latter's name back
                        to me with horrible iteration, had restrained all succeeding impulses to use
                        my voice. Now, however, the thunder of this waterfall in my ears, I opened
                        my mouth and shouted and sang. Not a word of it all did I hear, but that
                        made no difference; if I had heard, I would not have sung or shouted.</p>
                    <p>Greatly refreshed, and with a sense of relief inconceivable to one in any
                        other situation, I moved away from the fall and turned my attention to my
                        further progress, which might end in freedom or in a still more obscure tomb
                        in far distant recesses. I did not suffer myself to think of the latter
                        alternative, but in spite of my will that result forced itself into my mind
                        from time to time as the more probable. My only hope was that I had so far
                        followed unexplored portions of the Wyandotte cave, and that I should be
                        able to find the mouth of the latter or possibly some hitherto undiscovered
                        exit. It was not possible to do more than conjecture as to the direction in
                        which I had <pb id="VAA3892-238" n="226"/> traveled. At the start I felt
                        faintly assured that I was going northward, but after leaving the place of
                        the altar I had completely abandoned even that uncertain consolation.</p>
                    <p>Looking about me, I saw that the arcade ended abruptly against the high
                        masses of stone over which the stream dashed into the abyss. My eyes finally
                        fell on what appeared to be a mere cleft in the rock in the angle of the two
                        walls. For a time I hesitated whether to venture into it or to go back and
                        search for some other opening, many of which might have been passed without
                        observation while following the dry water-course.</p>
                    <p>Casting doubt aside I stepped into the cleft. At the point of entrance it was
                        hardly three feet wide, and its rough walls seemed to crowd me and throw me
                        from one to the other in a grim game of battledore, myself as the human
                        shuttlecock. I had felt the same sensation in other places and was now a
                        little used to it; nevertheless, I was disturbed when the fissure began to
                        narrow. Presently I came to a place where, standing still to test its width,
                        my shoulders touched both walls. From here on I was forced to move sideways,
                        dragging my bunch of torches behind me, and progress was slow and infinitely
                        tiring. I had not eaten nor slept--for how long I did not dare to think--and
                        had passed through experiences which would have been trying enough to a man
                        fresh and unwearied.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-239" n="227"/>
                    <p>And what wonder is it that I felt my strength leaving me and that something
                        between terror and despair possessed me? I could not sit down and rest; if I
                        should lie down in this terrible place I might never rise; if I should go
                        back I might not find another passage save that by which I had entered the
                        great arcade. I must go on while it were possible. After a while the passage
                        again ended abruptly against the solid rock. Moving back a little way, I
                        threw my light up and down the face of the obstruction and found that it did
                        not extend entirely to the ground. At the bottom the passage continued its
                        way but was reduced in height to three feet.</p>
                    <p>Lifting the bundle of unused torches over my head, I brought it in front and
                        kicked it with my foot into the opening; then throwing myself at full length
                        on the bottom, I poked my light into the hole and dragged my body after it.
                        I proceeded thus probably twenty feet, when, upon pushing the bundle ahead
                        of me, it suddenly left my hand and fell from sight, making a loud, hollow,
                        clattering noise as it came in contact with some obstruction below.</p>
                    <p>The character of the noise indicated that another chamber had been reached,
                        and my feelings underwent a sudden and agreeable revulsion. Quickly drawing
                        myself to the verge over which the torches fell, a sight greeted my eyes
                        that for a while made me doubt my senses. I was looking <pb id="VAA3892-240"
                            n="228"/> into what seemed to be thickly falling snow. The air was
                        filled with glittering flakes, and if the time had been in winter instead of
                        in the hot month of July, I would have believed that I had at last reached
                        the outer world, and would have shouted for joy.</p>
                    <p>But what was this ghostly stuff that came down from an unknown firmament,
                        filling the gloom with its grace and beauty? Pulling one of the sticks of
                        cane out of my torch I dropped it, all aflame, below me. It lit up the
                        ground, which was not more than six feet distant, and I followed it with my
                        body. I felt that I could breathe again, for here at least was room, and I
                        sat down on the bundle to rest.</p>
                    <p>The spectral snow was still falling, but in lessened quantity, and putting
                        out my hand I gathered some of the flakes in my palm. They were only
                        crystals of the sulphate of magnesia, which the concussion of the air
                        produced by the falling canes had shaken from the drifts with which the
                        ceiling of the chamber was covered. The room, I discovered, when, having
                        rested a few minutes, I had explored it, was not more than a hundred feet
                        long by fifty or sixty wide, but it was of wonderful beauty. It was a
                        veritable crystalline garden, and the cave flowers, in clusters, in garlands
                        and rosettes, with which it was so lavishly adorned, gleamed and flashed on
                        every hand.</p>
                    <p>A wide, arched avenue led from this chamber <pb id="VAA3892-241" n="229"/>
                        into another two or three furlongs away, more irregular in outline but
                        larger and more lofty. Its dome was supported by massive columns.
                        Magnificent stalactites hung from its ceiling and draped its walls with
                        fantastic tapestry. This chamber was only one of many of varying shapes and
                        proportions which, within the ensuing hours, passed in review before my
                        wearied but observant eyes. Enormous stalactites, like great cones of ice,
                        made resplendent the vaulted roofs; gigantic stalagmites stood about, like
                        cyclopean sentinels, all adrip; efflorescent crystals and pillars of
                        alabaster flashed across my vision until I was surfeited even with their
                        surpassing beauty.</p>
                    <p>During this portion of my journey I found little difficulty in threading the
                        passages that opened out before me. They were so numerous that my only
                        trouble was in choosing between them, and this I did, of necessity, at a
                        venture, trusting to providence to guide my aching feet.</p>
                    <p>At last I came to a room of considerable size from which led a solitary
                        passage. I had followed this for a distance that I judged to be a quarter of
                        a mile, when I observed that it was tending downward. The fall at first was
                        slight, but it gradually became more and more sloping as I advanced. After
                        awhile I got to a point where the fissure--for such it seemed to
                        be--suddenly widened.</p>
                    <p>Before I could scrutinize my surroundings my <pb id="VAA3892-242" n="230"/>
                        feet slipped from under me and I slid down a smooth incline, fetching up
                        against a dry wall at the bottom. No harm was done by the unpremeditated
                        coasting, but I was alarmed on noticing that the fissure ended there. At one
                        side there was a well-like opening above me; with that exception there was
                        no exit save that by which I had come. Reasoning that as the other chambers
                        through which I had passed were seemingly on the same level the shaft might
                        lead to another, I examined its walls and determined that it was possible to
                        climb them. The hole was less than a yard in diameter and numerous
                        projecting stones furnished tolerable footholds.</p>
                    <p>Stringing my bundle of torches--now considerably reduced in size--on my back,
                        I began the ascent. I made even better headway than I had at first thought
                        possible, for the shaft soon became spiral, thus lessening the danger in
                        falling if I should lose my hold. To a man fresh and vigorous from rest and
                        refreshment the work would have been laborious; to me it was a struggle.
                        Toward what proved to be the end, the shaft again became vertical and
                        narrowed to a mere crack where the stones had been wrenched asunder in some
                        mighty convulsion. I had to cast about for openings large enough to admit my
                        body, and picked my way through spear-like points that tore my clothes and
                        flesh.</p>
                    <p>All things must end, and this painful experience <pb id="VAA3892-243" n="231"
                        /> was no exception to the rule. After many minutes of alternate climbing,
                        creeping and resting, I got to a place where there were no more stony teeth
                        to pierce me and no walls within the reach of my hands. Throwing myself over
                        the brink of this terrible crevice, I lay panting and exhausted on the cool
                        floor of a room so small that, from where I lay, the whole of it was lighted
                        by the single torch in my hand. It was, in truth, but the mere widening of a
                        passage, along the arching roof of which, ten feet above my head, ran a
                        continuation of the fissure through which I had just passed.</p>
                    <p>For a long time I rested thus, and then, pursuing my way and making many
                        turnings in and out, and up and down, and at last crawling through a hole
                        barely large enough to allow me to proceed, I presently emerged into a part
                        of the cavern where the dome-like roof lifted up, and up, to a height far
                        beyond the reach of the rays of the fresh torch that I brought into use.</p>
                    <p>But what was this mountainous mass piercing the blackness above me? I began
                        to shake as with a fit of the ague, and tremblingly, and with a haste born
                        of a sudden great hope, I detached and lighted another torch from my bundle
                        and held the two aloft in my unsteady hands.</p>
                    <p>"Thank God!" I cried aloud.</p>
                    <p>It was the first time I had spoken since I sat beside the falling river. A
                        subterranean mountain <pb id="VAA3892-244" n="232"/> towered above to a
                        height of nearly one hundred and fifty feet, and yet I knew that the dome of
                        this immense chamber was still fifty feet above that. I was in a known part
                        of the great cavern at last, and stood beside the solemn walls of the
                        "Cathedral," where I had stood on a former occasion. Whereas I had begun my
                        underground pilgrimage seven miles in a straight line to the south of the
                        entrance to this stupendous tunnel, I was now more than a mile to the north
                        of it. But what an immeasurably greater distance had I traveled! From here
                        onward I knew the way, and could follow it at my leisure.</p>
                    <p>The great strain that my situation had put upon me relaxed, and I felt the
                        weakness that my exertions and the lack of food and sleep had produced.
                        Putting my hand in my pocket for my watch to ascertain the time, I found
                        that it was gone. Ah, well, that was a trifle now. I would rest a little and
                        then go on. Seeking a spot near the cavern wall, I lay down and slept.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">A DISCREDITED SPY</head>
                    <p>I <hi rend="sc">WAS</hi> awakened by something striking me sharply on the
                        face, and sat up, startled and alert. The light had burned out and I was in
                        total darkness. A great whirring sound filled the impenetrable gloom, and,
                        as I listened, the near flutter of wings and little fanning puffs of air
                        told of the zig-zag flight of the cave bats. I felt that I had slept an
                        hour, but it might have been much more or less than that. So accustomed had
                        I become to irregular hours since being in the field that a little sleep
                        sufficed to refresh me. Excepting an uncomfortable hunger, and a stiffness
                        caused by my bruises, I felt that I was none the worse for my extraordinary
                        adventures.</p>
                    <p>While preparing to light a fresh torch, my attention was attracted by a
                        perpendicular streak of light that suddenly flashed upon the side of the
                        great underground mountain. Once there, it remained stationary, save for a
                        faintly vibrating motion observable at its edges. I watched it for several
                        minutes, and then saw it rapidly widen and disappear in a general glow that
                        filled the <pb id="VAA3892-246" n="234"/> part of the cavern on that side of
                        the mountain with a misty yellow light.</p>
                    <p>Turning my head, I saw through the mist, at a height of twenty feet or more
                        up the cavern's wall, a powerful lantern, which was at once the cause and
                        the center of the display. The lantern was held in a man's hand, and the
                        man, standing in a crevice in the wall which was barely wide enough to give
                        him room, was talking with somebody behind him.</p>
                    <p>They were too far away for me to understand what was said; but presently a
                        ladder was pushed through edgewise and lowered to the ground, and the man
                        with the lantern came down. He then turned the light upon the ladder, and a
                        second man descended; then another followed and three stood on the floor.
                        Not one of them had spoken since the ladder was lowered. But these were
                        clearly not all who were expected, for the light still rested on the ladder
                        and the three men were looking upward toward the opening. There seemed to be
                        a commotion up there and angry voices, in the midst of which could be
                        distinguished another voice lifted up apparently in appeal.</p>
                    <p>Finally a man was pushed out and began to back down the rungs of the ladder;
                        a rope was around his neck and the rope reached up to the hands of a
                        stalwart fellow standing in the mouth of the crevice, who was paying it out
                        as the other <pb id="VAA3892-247" n="235"/> descended. When the latter
                        reached the ground the rope was thrown to one of-the three who stood ready
                        to receive it.</p>
                    <p>Other men bearing lanterns then came down--how many I did not know, my eyes
                        being upon the prisoner. That he was a prisoner had been already shown; but
                        the binding of his hands behind his back, which two of the men now proceeded
                        to do, removed any possible doubt. When all had descended, the party moved
                        to the other side of the cavern behind the mountain. I followed and secured
                        a position where, without being myself in danger of discovery, I could both
                        see and hear what was going on.</p>
                    <p>The prisoner was seated on a fallen stalactite near the wall, partly in the
                        shadow, but soon one of the lights was shifted so that its rays fell upon
                        his face. I started on seeing the pale countenance of Dallas Vawter as he
                        looked in a dull and hopeless way about him, first at one man and then at
                        another, as if trying to read the fate in store for him. Two of the men had
                        drawn a little apart from the others and were holding a whispered
                        conversation.</p>
                    <p>All of the men whose faces I could see were unknown to me, but the two
                        leaders I afterward knew to be Griswold and Wysart, who, with the others now
                        about them, were members of one of the numerous companies that the
                        exigencies of their border location had brought together for defense <pb
                            id="VAA3892-248" n="236"/> against marauding bands of outside foes;
                        also, as it appeared, for protection against any possible uprising at home,
                        rumors of which had been widely circulated. Where had they found Vawter and
                        why had they brought him here? The conversation between the two men was not
                        prolonged and presently they went back to the group around the prisoner. The
                        latter was the first to speak.</p>
                    <p>"Oak-oun," he said, and repeated it twice in a sort of refrain, as if
                        bewailing an unhappy lot, while his eyes were busy searching the
                        countenances before him.</p>
                    <p>The men stared at him contemptuously as at a whimpering coward, all except
                        one, who, standing farthest back and unobserved by his companions, suddenly
                        placed one hand on his breast and lifted the other straight in the air, as
                        quickly lowering it, at the same time giving a warning motion of his head.
                        That some sort of understanding was thereby established between the two I
                        did not doubt. Vawter's manner at once seemed to change.</p>
                    <p>''I hope you have agreed on something pleasant," he said, addressing Griswold
                        in a tone of now sneering bravado. "Make an end of it; you have brought me
                        to this pit of hell, now do your devil's work and do it quickly. I have
                        begged all I shall."</p>
                    <p>"We have plenty of time," Griswold returned, in a voice as grim and cold as
                        the rock about <pb id="VAA3892-249" n="237"/> him. "We are not sure that we
                        may not give you a chance after all. I don't promise it, and do not say what
                        kind; it depends on you."</p>
                    <p>"Perhaps," said Vawter, with a grimace, "you will allow me a choice between
                        strangulation and a broken neck."</p>
                    <p>Griswold looked at him for a moment before answering. "It is not exactly
                        that; it is a choice between certain death and a chance to live."</p>
                    <p>"Well, go on; I am listening."</p>
                    <p>"You have been in this country north of the river for two months--just
                        hanging around with no business that we could see. A good many times you've
                        gone to Roger Bellray's house, and Sumber's and Fisher's and others of their
                        kind. From your conduct we thought you were a government agent gathering
                        proofs against suspects. While some of us didn't believe in that way of
                        trapping a man, we likewise did not see fit to meddle with the government's
                        business. Today you were seen among Morgan's men as bold as brass and as
                        insolent as any swashbuckling thief among his three thousand."</p>
                    <p>As Vawter listened, his face took on a variety of expressions--surprise,
                        amusement, hope, the first mentioned being given emphasis by a lifting of
                        the head, a half-open mouth and a questioning look in his eyes. If he were
                        acting he did it very well.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-250" n="238"/>
                    <p>"What are you driving at?" he asked impatiently, as the other stopped.</p>
                    <p>"Just this; instead of being a Unionist agent you are a rebel spy," said
                        Griswold.</p>
                    <p>"And who in Satan's name are you, and these -- these <hi rend="i"
                            >gentlemen?"</hi> asked the prisoner.</p>
                    <p>"We're Unionists, and we've got mighty tired of Kentucky spies, horse-thieves
                        and guerrillas."</p>
                    <p>"Unionists!" exclaimed Vawter; then, assuming an appearance of indignation,
                        he continued: "You are a pretty pack of patriots, indeed; you act more like
                        babies or fools. Of course I was with Morgan's men to-day, but before I was
                        with them I was with Captain Bracken--a man who knows what he is up to,
                        doesn't he? This is a fine turn you have given me. Untie my hands."</p>
                    <p>"Not so fast," said Griswold, but looking doubtful, while the men about him
                        began to talk among themselves in an unsettled way. "If you are not a rebel
                        spy, what are you?"</p>
                    <p>"I am what you first thought me--a government agent; none other in fact than
                        one of Captain Bracken's secret service men," Vawter said triumphantly, and
                        then added, as he caught the eyes of the one who had given the signal
                        looking at him suspiciously, "oak-oun, oak-oun." This might mean much or
                        little, but to my ears his voice had in it a ring of appeal as he uttered
                        the word.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-251" n="239"/>
                    <p>Griswold, as well as some of the rest, was clearly wavering, but he asked
                        another question:</p>
                    <p>"If you are what you claim to be why didn't you say so before instead of
                        resisting us and begging us not to kill you?"</p>
                    <p>"I might say that I thought it prudent not to reveal my true character unless
                        it became necessary at the last minute to save my life. But to tell the
                        truth I was not certain until just now that you were not Knights of the
                        Acorn. I've been pretty thick with some of them, and I was afraid I had been
                        seen reporting to Captain Bracken."</p>
                    <p>"So you took us for copperheads?" said Griswold in an offended tone.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, and you thought I was a spy, guerrilla and horse-thief. I think I have
                        most cause for offense," Vawter answered, laughing. "Here, take off this
                        cursed rope and I'll forgive your blundering--though I'll confess you have
                        given my nerves a shock--and if I can tell you anything that you want to
                        know, consistently with my orders, I am at your service. Come, untie
                        me."</p>
                    <p>The man was either playing a bold game, for which Griswold had given him an
                        opening, or else he was in earnest. I believed that he was at least partly
                        telling the truth.</p>
                    <p>Griswold turned to the man with whom he had spoken aside.</p>
                    <p>"What do you think, Wysart?"</p>
                    <p>"I think we'd better do now what we'd 'a' <pb id="VAA3892-252" n="240"/> done
                        in the beginning if we hadn't been so sure of our game, and that's search
                        the man," answered Wysart.</p>
                    <p>Vawter's countenance fell and in spite of himself he turned pale again, a
                        fact that the men were quick to observe.</p>
                    <p>Wysart thrust his hands in the prisoner's pockets and in a little while
                        brought forth a piece of paper, like a leaf torn from a small memorandum
                        book; holding it in the light of the lanterns, he looked it over and then
                        read aloud to his expectant companions a pass, signed by my General,
                        allowing the bearer to pass his lines, in or out, and bearing date of the
                        night before.</p>
                    <p>Then turning to Vawter, Wysart said: "Here is proof that you were in General
                        Morgan's confidence; now show us your credentials from Captain Bracken."</p>
                    <p>"You fools!" cried Vawter, again making a pretense of being very furious. "Do
                        you suppose I would have dared to show myself in the raiders' camp with
                        anything in my possession showing my true character? General Morgan would
                        have had me hanged by the roadside in no time. That writing proves nothing
                        more than I have already admitted--nothing more than you knew before I
                        admitted anything."</p>
                    <p>Without saying anything in return, Wysart renewed his search of the
                        prisoner's person with greater care but with no result. As he stepped <pb
                            id="VAA3892-253" n="241"/> back his eyes seemed to rest on the peculiar
                        metal buttons on Vawter's coat. In a moment he had taken a knife from his
                        pocket and removing the lower button began twisting at it with the fingers
                        of his two hands.</p>
                    <p>"Ah! What's this?" he suddenly exclaimed. "Seems to me I've heard of this
                        trick before, and it's a right cute one, too."</p>
                    <p>The others crowded around so that I could not see, but presently I heard
                        Wysart's voice reading: <text>
                            <body>

                                    <closer>

                                </div>
                            </body>
                        </text></p>
                    <p>"Do you still say that you are in the United States secret service?" asked
                        Griswold, when this damning confirmation of his guilt was read.</p>
                    <p>Vawter felt that the tide was against him, but he said, stoutly: "I do. I got
                        the coat I am wearing in the raiders' camp last night. I never saw it
                        before, never saw or heard of that paper until you found it and read it. My
                        name is not in it; it belongs to somebody else. I did not know that there
                        was anything peculiar about these buttons. For aught that I know there may
                        be a message of some sort in every one of them. You will not believe me, of
                        course, and I don't expect you to. Do what you are going to do and be quick
                        about it."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-254" n="242"/>
                    <p>Saying this much he leaned back against the rough cavern wall and looked at
                        them defiantly.</p>
                    <p>"It's a waste of time to argue the matter further," said Griswold, soberly.
                        "We have made no mistake; you are all that we suspected and a good deal
                        more, no doubt. It looks very much as if you are a traitor to both sides and
                        that is being about as 'ornery' as a man can get. Yet, in the face of it
                        all, we are disposed to seek information of you on the condition already
                        named. Do you agree."</p>
                    <p>"May it please you, gentlemen, there is nothing else for me to do," said
                        Vawter. "The situation is your making, and as between the certain death that
                        is promised on the one hand and a chance to live that is not promised on the
                        other, I prefer the latter. Now, good sirs, if you have made an end of your
                        preliminaries, come to the point."</p>
                    <p>"Very well," said Griswold, quickly. "We want to know about the arms found
                        this afternoon at Bellray's."</p>
                    <p>Vawter did not speak for a minute or two and seemed to be considering. Seeing
                        his hesitation, Griswold again spoke: "You do not belong in this country,
                        and are a stranger to our quarrels. The people who live hereabout are our
                        neighbors, and though we do not look at some things alike, we do not want to
                        suspect any man wrongfully nor to do any man an injury unless he deserves
                        it. <pb id="VAA3892-255" n="243"/> But we mean to protect ourselves and to
                        stand up for what we believe to be right. If you don't know, say so; if you
                        do know, if you speak at all, in heaven's name speak the truth."</p>
                    <p>"I know all about it," Vawter answered at last. "And mind you, not as a
                        conspirator, but in pursuance of my duty as an agent of the government."</p>
                    <p>He stopped again and seemed for a moment to fix his gaze upon the man in the
                        background, who appeared to be very uneasy about something, then he went on:
                        "When Morgan went into camp after crossing the river I was there. I had
                        attached myself to him as a guide, under instructions. That night Captain
                        John Trenham--some of you may know him--superintended the conveyance of the
                        arms to Bellray's house. They were supplied by the rebel government. I know
                        this because I followed him there and came near getting murdered for my
                        pains. The arms were to be used in equipping a lot of Knights of the Acorn
                        for war--an uprising to assist the invasion. The wounding of Bellray in the
                        attempt to arrest him no doubt scared the conspirators and frustrated their
                        immediate plans."</p>
                    <p>"Who are the men who were to use the arms?"</p>
                    <p>"That I don't know. Bellray was almost as suspicious of me as you are. It was
                        because I couldn't learn who were conspiring with him that I communicated
                        some days ago to the proper authorities <pb id="VAA3892-256" n="244"/> my
                        belief that it was necessary to arrest Bellray--who is the leader of them
                        all--and in that way scare the others. At that time I did not know how near
                        it was to the hour when they were to begin cutting your precious throats. It
                        seems that I would have fared better if I had kept still and let them go
                        ahead, since you are alive to do to me what they were preparing to do to
                        you."</p>
                    <p>"Is that all you know about it?" asked Griswold, mildly.</p>
                    <p>"That's all--except as to the girl," answered Vawter, feeling that he had at
                        last made an impression and hoping to strengthen it.</p>
                    <p>"What girl?"</p>
                    <p>"Why, none other than that sister of Bellray's, of course. She's in
                        communication with the enemy."</p>
                    <p>"Is she a spy?"</p>
                    <p>"Call it what you will; she is in communication with the enemy. I don't apply
                        the word 'spy' because it doesn't sound well, as I have learned to-night,"
                        Vawter replied.</p>
                    <p>"It's impossible," said Griswold.</p>
                    <p>'I don't believe it," said Wysart.</p>
                    <p>Some of the other men spoke to like effect and the prisoner saw that he had
                        overstepped himself.</p>
                    <p>The two leaders again went aside and talked between themselves for several
                        minutes, while I, who had heard Vawter's unblushing lies with constantly
                        rising anger, could scarce restrain myself <pb id="VAA3892-257" n="245"/>
                        from leaving my concealment and throttling the rascal where he sat.
                        Mechanically I gripped the handle of my sword until my fingers ached with
                        the pain of it. When the two men came back into the circle of lights,
                        Griswold, as before, was the first to speak.</p>
                    <p>"Men," he said, "Wysart and I don't take any stock in what this fellow says.
                        You know that it was rumored that John Trenham was with the raiders, and he
                        was watched for, but nobody saw him--"</p>
                    <p>"I forgot to say," broke in Vawter, "that I assisted Captain Bracken in
                        capturing Trenham at five o'clock this morning, while he was on his way from
                        Bellray's to rejoin his troop, and he is no doubt safe in Louisville long
                        before this."</p>
                    <p>"This man is talking for his life," said Wysart. "I myself saw him to-day
                        fire at a loyal citizen who refused to surrender his property at the command
                        of one of the raiders. But Griswold thinks, and so do I, that it is better
                        to give him a chance to save his worthless life on the condition that he
                        promises, if he gets out, to leave the country. What do you say?"</p>
                    <p>The men all said that they were satisfied, and Griswold turned to Vawter and
                        said:</p>
                    <p>"There are three openings from this place. One of them you can't reach for it
                        is the one we came through; that is the short way out. Another is a small
                        opening; that doesn't lead <pb id="VAA3892-258" n="246"/> out at all. The
                        last is a large passage, and by following it carefully for a mile or so you
                        will get outside. If you choose to stay here long enough somebody may come
                        this way and lead you out. Untie him, Wilson."</p>
                    <p>Vawter, when his hands were released, got to his feet. The others, leaving
                        him, went to the ladder and began to mount it, each man carrying his
                        lantern.</p>
                    <p>"Are you going to leave me without a light?" shouted the miserable man,
                        hurrying behind them.</p>
                    <p>They made him no answer.</p>
                    <p>"How do you expect me to get out of this hell-hole in the dark?" he screamed
                        after them as they continued to climb upward.</p>
                    <p>Wysart stopped half-way up the ladder, all the others having preceded him,
                        and looking down, said:</p>
                    <p>"That is the chance we give you, and it is much better than the other
                        thing."</p>
                    <p>"At least leave me a pistol," the wretch begged.</p>
                    <p>"We think you had better not have a pistol, but there is a sword up there
                        that belonged to one of the rebel officers. Do you know how to handle it? If
                        you don't it will serve as a tolerable walking stick."</p>
                    <p>"I do; better than anything else," he said eagerly, all his bravado gone.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-259" n="247"/>
                    <p>"Well, we don't. I'll drop it down to you."</p>
                    <p>So saying, Wysart mounted to the opening and the ladder was drawn up. Then
                        holding his light before him so that its rays shone on the upturned, anxious
                        face of the forsaken man, he leaned out and let fall the scabbarded weapon
                        into Vawter's outstretched hands.</p>
                    <p>"Now good-bye, you knave. If you get out, as I think you will, leave the
                        country. Your skin won't be worth a muskrat's pelt another time, depend on
                        it."</p>
                    <p>Flinging down this message, Wysart disappeared from the opening, leaving the
                        great "cathedral" in darkness. It seemed to me that just before he departed
                        a strange sound fell from his lips very like that which had been uttered by
                        Vawter, but it was likely in mockery of what he believed to be the other's
                        cowardice, for he laughed rather boisterously immediately afterward.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE DUEL IN THE CAVE</head>
                    <p>W<hi rend="sc">HEN</hi> Vawter realized that he was actually abandoned to his
                        fate, he filled the mighty chamber with curses, which he directed against
                        all who were concerned in bringing upon him his present trouble. After a
                        time he ceased his impotent oaths, and I heard him begin to grope cautiously
                        about in search of the outlet of which he had been told. The fellow's
                        character was such as to justify an honest man in withholding sympathy, and
                        I, who was consumed by a righteous wrath, was in a humor to adopt an extreme
                        course. Had it not been for my own experience within the past twenty-four
                        hours I might have left him to his own resources.</p>
                    <p>As I sat, however, listening to the shuffling steps, and the stumbling,
                        halting progress of Vawter my heart smote me, and I resolved to offer myself
                        as guide. And then, when we were outside, face to face and on an equal
                        footing--then what? I grasped the handle of my sword, and my breath came and
                        went through my gritted teeth. Judging from the faintness of the sounds <pb
                            id="VAA3892-261" n="249"/> now made by Vawter, he had found his way to
                        the opposite side of the mountain. Lighting one of my torches, I followed.
                        The rays from the flaming canes reached a long distance ahead, and before I
                        had proceeded far there was an exclamation, the noise of rapid steps, and
                        Vawter's voice broke out, before he came into my view, saying:</p>
                    <p>"And so you were just trying my nerves, were you, or are you coming back to
                        finish the job? But whatever you've come for--" and then, turning the
                        mountain's jutting base, he stood within a few feet of one of the last
                        persons he could have expected to see in that place.</p>
                    <p>"Captain Trenham!" he cried, springing back a step. He had flung away the
                        scabbard and held the naked sword in his hand.</p>
                    <p>"I am glad you recognize me," said I calmly.</p>
                    <p>Vawter stood irresolute for several moments, his face working under the
                        influence of the warring emotions of fear, hatred and relief, but of all
                        these that of hatred was the strongest.</p>
                    <p>"I don't wonder that you had your doubts on that score," he said at last,
                        recovering from his surprise. "If you had a mirror handy you could
                        appreciate the humor of your question. You do not much resemble the
                        well-groomed officer who last night struck me in the face in the presence of
                        his mistress."</p>
                    <p>"Whether I do or not, I distinctly remember <pb id="VAA3892-262" n="250"/>
                        the circumstance and am willing to give you satisfaction," I returned as
                        quietly as I could under his goading. "But first, as you are not familiar
                        with this place, I offer you the benefit of my light and my knowledge. The
                        trying position in which your friends left you appeals to me."</p>
                    <p>"Thanks," he said with a snarl. "Save your sympathy for those who will accept
                        it. I want neither it nor your aid."</p>
                    <p>"As you will," I replied, half making ready to go my way. "I felt it my
                        humane duty to make the offer but I can not compel you to accept it. The
                        passages are difficult but not absolutely impassable even in the
                        darkness."</p>
                    <p>"Rather than put myself under any kind of obligation to you I will rot where
                        I am, for I have sworn to myself to kill you soon or late."</p>
                    <p>His manner suddenly became threatening, for my appearance, I judged, told him
                        that I was weakened by something that had befallen me. Or did he,
                        coward-like, take my conduct as a sign of fear, and look upon the offer of
                        help as being made in an effort to propitiate a dreaded enemy?</p>
                    <p>"You can kill me as well outside as here," said I, controlling myself by a
                        great effort and speaking without heat, "and have a much better chance for
                        your own safety."</p>
                    <p>"What is to prevent me from running you through where you stand, and by the
                        aid of your <pb id="VAA3892-263" n="251"/> excellent torch--then mine by the
                        right of conquest--finding my own way?"</p>
                    <p>"This," I retorted, striking the hilt of my sword.</p>
                    <p>"Bah," he cried, a scornful smile curling his mouth. "You cavalrymen know
                        only how to hack and hew. The cracking of a head from a safe seat on a
                        horse's back is not the gentlemanly way, and it is not mine. I warn you that
                        in the use of the sword I am your master."</p>
                    <p>"I am glad to know that you are skillful."</p>
                    <p>"Why should you be glad? Really, sir, you are something of a humorist."</p>
                    <p>"Because I should not fight you if you were not," said I, answering his
                        question and ignoring his fling.</p>
                    <p>"Oh!" contemptuously. "You take high ground, my captain; or do you offer that
                        as a fair specimen of your wit?"</p>
                    <p>"There is such a thing as conscience--the information seems to surprise
                        you--and it has created in me an insurmountable prejudice against doing a
                        murder, for that it would be to kill a man who is not able to defend
                        himself."</p>
                    <p>"You make a good plea for yourself, but I am not always--particularly now, in
                        your case--troubled by such a flimsy scruple. A man must be prepared to look
                        out for himself; if you are not it is not my fault."</p>
                    <p>"Do not misunderstand me," said I, with <pb id="VAA3892-264" n="252"/>
                        strained seriousness, but feeling my temper rise under his taunts. "I
                        possess some skill myself. Whether it is equal to that of which you boast I
                        do not know, but it is considerable. I am not bragging of it--only putting
                        you in possession of the fact before you assail me."</p>
                    <p>"You are kind, indeed," he said jeeringly, "but your assertion of excellence
                        amuses rather than frightens me. The only really serious concern of my life
                        has been to master this weapon--a sort of fad, you know. And, by the way,
                        this sword fits nicely to my hand and seems to be of good metal."</p>
                    <p>Saying which, he stepped back a pace and made several graceful passes and
                        lunges at an imaginary foe to test the blade and incidentally to impress me
                        with his proficiency in its use.</p>
                    <p>"Come," I said, impatiently; "if you will not accept my guidance, I will
                        leave with you my last extra torch. With it you can follow me and I will
                        wait for you on the outside."</p>
                    <p>"Pardon me, but since thinking the matter over, I prefer to settle our
                        differences here. The light might be better, but the room is ample, and the
                        temperature delightful. It is, I assure you, too hot for our work in the
                        outer air. Besides, you might not see fit to wait for me, or we might be
                        disturbed. When I leave this place I choose to leave it as quietly as
                        possible. Nobody will know where you are, and my suit for the hand of <pb
                            id="VAA3892-265" n="253"/> the fair Kate may again prosper--aye, it will
                        prosper."</p>
                    <p>"Stop!" I exclaimed at this. "You will provoke me too far and I shall forget
                        my good purpose." But he went on unheedingly, as if determined to affront me
                        beyond endurance:</p>
                    <p>"She acted very well the other night--for it was acting--when she saw that
                        you were watching, and concluded that the presence of so fierce a warrior as
                        the renowned Captain Trenham might endanger my safety. She was wrong there,
                        of course, but your interruption prevented what would otherwise have been a
                        very tender parting. We will adjust all our affairs here and now."</p>
                    <p>"You lying knave," cried I, hoarse with suppressed fury. "If nothing else
                        will do you, so be it," and drawing the sword, which more than once I had
                        been on the point of abandoning as cumbersome, I unbuckled my belt and threw
                        the scabbard aside.</p>
                    <p>Then taking up the last extra torch of canes I lighted it in the blaze of the
                        other and both were stuck into cracks in the stone wall, thus brightly
                        illuminating a space on the cavern's floor having a diameter more than
                        sufficient for our purpose. These preparations were made without a word
                        being spoken by either. When they were completed, Vawter, who had watched me
                        all the while, as I could see from the corner of my eye--for I did not in
                        the least trust him--coolly removed <pb id="VAA3892-266" n="254"/> his hat
                        and coat and put them out of the way. I did likewise with my coat, having no
                        hat.</p>
                    <p>Then we faced each other in the center of the lighted circle, no mortal eye
                        upon us, no human presence to stay our hands. Vawter's lips curled
                        insolently as he toyed with his weapon, and yet as he looked into my eyes
                        and noted my earnestness I felt that his confidence failed him a little. For
                        a moment only did we gaze at each other, and then throwing himself into
                        position, Vawter cried out:</p>
                    <p>"Come on, Mr. Cavalryman; begin your hacking."</p>
                    <p>Instantly our blades flashed and rang as they met. For a few seconds they
                        ground together while each looked into the other's eyes for the sign of
                        attack. Presently the sudden increase of pressure against my sword warned me
                        of a thrust, which followed instantly, but which I easily parried. After
                        that Vawter made feints, lunges and thrusts with great rapidity and skill,
                        but I, being content to let him exhaust himself, met them all with an art
                        which I was vain enough to believe was not inferior to his own. And then,
                        too, I felt that the binding of his arms at the wrists, from which he was
                        not long freed, was at least not to my disadvantage, for without a
                        well-conditioned wrist the highest art may prove of no avail against even a
                        clumsy but bold opponent.</p>
                    <p>A man ready in defense should be no less expert <pb id="VAA3892-267" n="255"
                        /> in onset, and as I had so far been successful in the first, I hoped, for
                        its moral effect, that Vawter might believe that I would be equally
                        efficient in the latter. A lack of confidence in one's self is worse than
                        overfaith, and since it may be produced as well by discovering an enemy's
                        strength as by knowledge of one's own weakness, I put forth my powers as far
                        as I could without wasting my strength, for I found that I was dealing with
                        no mean antagonist.</p>
                    <p>When, after the lapse of several minutes, Vawter had tried every stroke and
                        trick in which he was practiced without breaking through my guard, I fancied
                        that he was beginning to be less hopeful of a favorable outcome. Seeming to
                        realize this himself, with a desperation begotten by the too evident failure
                        of his boasted prowess, he fell upon me for a while with renewed vigor,
                        plying his blade in drive and thrust, but still he did not reach. Then, as
                        he rested for a moment, the weapons sliding against each other with a
                        metallic purring sound, I felt that the time had come for me to abandon the
                        defensive attitude that I had thus far maintained.</p>
                    <p>"Guard yourself, sir," cried I.</p>
                    <p>"Look to your own skin," he flung back.</p>
                    <p>For a few seconds more the purring continued, then came a harsher grind of
                        steel, accompanied by a clicking sound as if the hotly throbbing blood of
                        both shook the weapons with every <pb id="VAA3892-268" n="256"/> heart-beat.
                        Vawter, in despairing rage, attempted a villainous foul, but knowing his
                        treacherous character I foresaw the blow, and evaded it.</p>
                    <p>Immediately, in pursuance of my warning, I became the aggressor, and slipped
                        my blade from one side to the other of my opponent's sword, executing
                        frequent short thrusts and feints with an adeptness that seemed to nettle
                        him, and playing over and under his guard in a way calculated to show him
                        that I was particular where I should touch. My chief purpose, of course, was
                        not that, but was to uncover his parades.</p>
                    <p>As in attack, now in defense Vawter put forth his utmost skill, exhibiting
                        both a natural and trained dexterity of a high order, and skillfully foiling
                        many of my attempted disengagements; but I kept my arm moving rapidly in the
                        manner that I had been taught by the best master in France, and soon saw in
                        his face signs of distress beneath the scowl that he had worn all along. He
                        at last fell to defending himself mechanically, and appeared to be waiting
                        for the thrust that should settle the contest.</p>
                    <p>I did not seek his life, for twice had my point found an opening and slightly
                        pricked his body, and once, going over his guard, had flashed beneath his
                        frightened eyes to his very throat and then leaped back again, leaving him
                        shaking and ghastly. But a quick realization of my forbearance bolstered his
                        spirit and restored strength to <pb id="VAA3892-269" n="257"/> his arm, and
                        for a little time he worked with desperation. That he would kill me if he
                        could I was well satisfied, while I did not desire more than his
                        disablement.</p>
                    <p>I set about to end the combat. Twice I made a serious effort to touch him and
                        failed, whereat he spat out vicious taunts to further disconcert me, which
                        almost made me regret that I had not run him through. Warned by a growing
                        faintness that my long fast was telling upon me, and dreading lest Vawter
                        should see my plight, I summoned to my aid all of my reserve strength and,
                        with set mouth and stern gaze, began pushing my adversary, having a dim,
                        half-bewildered consciousness that the end was near.</p>
                    <p>For an instant there was light play of the swords, then once more and for the
                        last time a tense grating of steel, then the gleam of a straight blade. With
                        an exclamation of pain Vawter staggered backward, his weapon falling from
                        his relaxed hand to the cavern floor with a loud, resonant clang. His sword
                        arm hung by his side, and blood stained his white sleeve and dripped from
                        his fingers.</p>
                    <p>"I am at your mercy, sir," he said, reeling, his face very white.</p>
                    <p>Casting my weapon aside, I threw my arm about my defeated adversary, and
                        supporting him to a seat at the base of the mountain, set to <pb
                            id="VAA3892-270" n="258"/> work to ascertain the character of the wound.
                        A look sufficed to show that my sword had pierced the arm through and
                        through a few inches above the elbow, missing the bone.</p>
                    <p>"The injury is not serious, Mr. Vawter," I said when the examination was
                        finished.</p>
                    <p>"For which I thank you; you could just as easily have found my heart."</p>
                    <p>"I never intended to take your life; what I did was to prevent you from
                        taking mine."</p>
                    <p>"You are a magnanimous foe, for I would have killed you if I could, as I told
                        you. And I really thought I could, but you surprised me."</p>
                    <p>I made no response to this frank avowal, and proceeded to bind up the wound
                        as best I could with strips torn from the injured man's shirt. Completing
                        this task, I then conducted him to a near-by spring of which I had knowledge
                        and refreshed him with a drink of the cold water; then removed from both as
                        far as possible the red signs of the conflict. This done, I said:</p>
                    <p>"I renew my offer to act as your guide from this place. It is impossible that
                        you should again refuse, for you will presently require the attention of a
                        surgeon."</p>
                    <p>A look of gratitude came into the man's face and for the time obscured its
                        evil lines.</p>
                    <p>"You are the master," he said; "command and I obey. And, Captain, let me say
                        that I feel that you have done me good by the wholesome <pb id="VAA3892-271"
                            n="259"/> lessons that you have impressed upon me within the past half
                        hour. It may not last, for I have been too long leading a wicked and
                        irresolute life to change all at once. But just now I feel a new kind of
                        impulse and sensations to which heretofore I have been a stranger. I say it
                        may not last, and to-morrow I may be just as eager to cut your throat as I
                        was thirty minutes ago, and follow just as recklessly as in the past the
                        straight road to hell. Somehow I hope these new feelings will last. Will you
                        take my hand?"</p>
                    <p>I grasped the extended hand and pressed it warmly, though it was not, I will
                        confess, without some thought of the sick devil's resolution to become a
                        monk.</p>
                    <p>"It is the left one, but that isn't my fault, you know," he said, smiling
                        weakly.</p>
                    <p>"The other will soon be sound enough," said I, and then continued: "There is
                        no reason why you shouldn't be what you hope; for your own sake try. As for
                        me I bear you no malice." It should not be said that I withheld from a
                        penitent enemy the support of my encouragement.</p>
                    <p>"I have done you grave injuries."</p>
                    <p>"I know."</p>
                    <p>"I have falsely accused you to your old neighbors of doing a dastardly
                        thing."</p>
                    <p>"I heard it all."</p>
                    <p>"And I lied about <hi rend="i">her.</hi>"</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-272" n="260"/>
                    <p>"I heard that, too, and--once I thought I would kill you for it."</p>
                    <p>"I almost wish you had; my life is worthless."</p>
                    <p>"We will not discuss these things now," I returned. "We must be off."</p>
                    <p>Without further words the start was made. As we went along he told me how,
                        leaving my General's column late in the afternoon, he turned back, pursuing
                        a course far to the westward of that followed in the morning and intending
                        to reach Leavenworth. He did not feel that it would be safe for him to show
                        himself openly to any of the inhabitants about Corydon, for fear that they
                        had misunderstood him and his part in the day's adventures. Saying which, he
                        laughed mockingly, muttering, "the fools, the idiots," and other
                        uncomplimentary terms from which I concluded that the leopard could not
                        change all of his spots at once.</p>
                    <p>About nine o'clock he had been set upon by a party of horsemen who,
                        recognizing him, had carried him off into the woods a little distance where
                        they held a council of war, as he phrased it, in which he heard the words
                        "spy" and "arms" and "Bellray's." One or two of the men had, he thought,
                        proposed to hang him at once without the benefit of clergy. But after a
                        little time they had taken him to a hole in the ground where lanterns were
                        produced, and from thence to the place where they had left him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-273" n="261"/>
                    <p>"I prefer to forget what took place there," he said a little mournfully.</p>
                    <p>Then he brightened again. "For a while they had me going, and my nerves were
                        a little shaky. But after a time it occurred to me that I had an arrow which
                        I had not shot, and so I sang a short ditty that seemed to meet with the
                        approbation of at least one of the knaves, for he indicated that I had a
                        friend at court. How he happened to be in that company--but then I am
                        sometimes in queer company myself."</p>
                    <p>An hour's easy progress brought us into the open air which seemed as good and
                        sweet to me as the breath of paradise after my long immurement, and a prayer
                        of thankfulness for God's mercy rose in my heart as I turned my eyes upon
                        the star-studded sky. Extinguishing my torch, we went a little aside and sat
                        down to rest before parting, each to go his way, Vawter toward Leavenworth,
                        a few miles distant, and I--where?</p>
                    <p>Presently we heard voices, and soon two men, one of them bearing a lantern,
                        emerged from the entrance that we had left a few minutes before. Reaching
                        the outside, the one with the light raised it to put it out, in the act
                        disclosing the faces of the two men.</p>
                    <p>"It is my friend," whispered Vawter, "and--hell's fire--"</p>
                    <p>"And Wysart," I added.</p>
                    <p>It was indeed the man who had given the sign <pb id="VAA3892-274" n="262"/>
                        from the background in response to Vawter's peculiar refrain, and one of the
                        leaders, who, while able, no doubt, and willing to answer also was not in a
                        position to do so with safety. They did not tarry, but made off, and I heard
                        them as they went assuring each other that they had at least done their
                        duty. When they were well out of sight and hearing, my companion, after
                        re-asserting that he was no longer my enemy, also left me, his face so white
                        and drawn with the pain of his wound that I observed it even in the feeble
                        light afforded by the stars, and pitied the rascal, for such he had been and
                        was likely to continue.</p>
                    <p>He had told me nothing further than I have related, but it was plain enough
                        that he and Wysart and the other, though strangers, were bound by some sort
                        of tie, of which they could make demonstration. The two men had, after
                        leaving their companions, returned to give him aid, so artfully had he
                        thrown in the magic word while pronouncing himself the servant of their
                        enemy. He was in truth a very accomplished knave.</p>

                        better to do just then, I set out for my mother's house, intending to remain
                        there if I could until an opportunity offered to get out of the country.
                        There was no reasonable hope of being able to rejoin my command, which would
                        be forced to sweep ahead like a thunder cloud before the breath of the storm
                        behind it. Once at my mother's, I could lie quietly by, and under cover of
                        the following night reach the Ohio and trust to luck to find some means of
                        recrossing into Kentucky.</p>
                    <p>With these thoughts in my mind I went along until I had covered most of the
                        distance to be traversed, thinking little of my physical state; but now I
                        began to feel faint and weak from the lack of food and the reaction from the
                        strain under which I had labored for so many heart-breaking hours. My feet
                        were heavy as lead, and my limbs moved sluggishly and with difficulty.
                        Coming to a large boulder by the side of the road I sat down upon the ground
                        to rest, my back against <pb id="VAA3892-276" n="264"/> the rock. My
                        mother's home was not far away, and if I did not misjudge the hour I still
                        had ample time to reach it before daylight. Nothing was further from my
                        intention than to allow myself to fall asleep, yet such a misadventure
                        overtook me.</p>
                    <p>I was awakened by hearing my name called. It was broad daylight, and many
                        horsemen stood in the road a few feet away, all of them wearing the garb of
                        my General's soldiers. What had happened to stop them here? Had they thus
                        early been defeated and scattered?</p>
                    <p>"In God's name, Trenham, what's the matter with you?" called out a familiar
                        voice, none other than that of Captain Sivad, who had been detached from the
                        main column before we crossed the river, and had not rejoined us at the time
                        that event took place.</p>
                    <p>He had, it subsequently transpired, himself crossed at Twelve Mile Island,
                        with two troops, which had been reduced to less than fifty men, the number
                        now with him. I did not wonder at his consternation on beholding me, ragged,
                        bareheaded, and woe-begone as I certainly looked. On my part, while my
                        satisfaction was great on seeing him and his men, I felt a sense of
                        mortification at my plight, though there was no need, considering what had
                        led to it.</p>
                    <p>"There is enough the matter with me, Sivad," I answered, referring to his
                        exclamatory question. <pb id="VAA3892-277" n="265"/> "But the thing I need
                        most urgently is some breakfast, as I have eaten nothing for thirty
                        hours."</p>
                    <p>Whatever misfortunes these men had suffered, the want of food was not one,
                        and without more ado my needs in this respect were quickly supplied. While I
                        was eating, I recounted enough of my experiences to explain my present
                        situation. Captain Sivad, on his part, having acquired it from the
                        inhabitants, had more recent information than I as to the General's
                        movements, and confided to me his purpose to get out of the country before
                        he was completely destroyed.</p>
                    <p>It would be the wildest folly, he proclaimed, to attempt to follow the main
                        body of our fellows. In this respect we were of one mind, for nothing was
                        clearer than the fact that we could not now hope to be of any service to our
                        chief, and that an attempt to render any, as the situation now showed
                        itself, would lead to nothing more or less than our own annihilation.</p>
                    <p>Sivad told me also that he had heard that a large force of mounted Federal
                        soldiers had crossed the river the evening before in pursuit of the General,
                        and that he thought he would lie by for a day until the enemy was out of the
                        neighborhood. As it was, he had traveled most of the night, without a guide
                        and hap-hazard. To this he was put by much harrying and because of <pb
                            id="VAA3892-278" n="266"/> his belief that his position and strength
                        were known, and that the legionaries were concentrating to attack him in
                        such numbers as to leave him small chance to save the poor remnant of his
                        command.</p>
                    <p>A deep wood lay to the south of the road, and into that we made our way for
                        probably half a mile until we came to a narrow grassy valley between two
                        fair-sized hills. Near the middle of the valley ran a little stream of clear
                        water. It seemed to be an ideal place for our purpose, as the forest was
                        dense and extensive in all directions.</p>
                    <p>Being myself without a horse, I had waited at the side of the road until all
                        of the men were well into the wood and then started to follow on foot. I had
                        not gone far and was still within the view of persons who might, by chance,
                        pass along the road, when I heard the clatter of hoofs. I dropped
                        instinctively to the ground before turning my eyes in the direction of the
                        sounds. When I did look, I saw two women on horseback in the act of checking
                        their horses while they turned their faces toward where I lay.</p>
                    <p>To my amazement they proved to be Kate Bellray and Betty West. I knew that
                        they had long been accustomed to early morning rides, but I was greatly
                        surprised to see them at this time in view of the unsettled condition of the
                        country. Just now as they gazed in my direction, if not at <pb
                            id="VAA3892-279" n="267"/> me--for I felt that I could not be seen where
                        I lay--I fancied that they looked startled. From this it was easy to judge
                        that they had either seen me or some of the cavalrymen straggling further on
                        through the trees.</p>
                    <p>Had I been alone I might have revealed myself and hailed them, disreputable
                        as my appearance was, but as matters were no such thought entered my mind.
                        They did not stop, but only slowed their pace, and this but briefly, for in
                        a moment they turned squarely about and putting whip to their animals went
                        rapidly back in the direction from which they came. This action was
                        sufficient to confirm my already well-founded conjecture that we had been
                        observed. But there was no help for it, nor did it greatly increase my
                        apprehension. I said nothing about it to Sivad, for I could conceive of no
                        way in which the little that the girls had seen was likely to prove harmful
                        to us.</p>
                    <p>During the day the horses grazed contentedly upon the grass bordering both
                        sides of the stream, and the men, lying about in the shade of the trees,
                        secured the sleep of which they, like myself, greatly stood in need. Not all
                        day, however, were they thus idle. Sivad, about noon, sent three men back to
                        the road, with instruction to bring in some passer-by from whom information
                        might be obtained. Two hours later they reappeared, one of them leading a
                        horse upon which <pb id="VAA3892-280" n="268"/> sat a boy of sixteen or
                        thereabout, while the other two walked behind. He was at once taken before
                        Captain Sivad for questioning, appearing to be very cool and self-possessed,
                        and exhibiting no trace of fear.</p>
                    <p>"Well, my boy, what is your name?" asked the officer, not unkindly.</p>
                    <p>"It's Sam Hollen--I don't mind tellin' you as a name won't ha'm nobody."</p>
                    <p>"Do you live around here?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, suh; I wo'k at Mistah Bellray's--been theah since last wintah."</p>
                    <p>"You don't talk like a Hoosier."</p>
                    <p>"I ain't suh, I'm f'om Geo'gy," said the boy, looking Sivad calmly in the
                        face. "And I ain't a rebel, like you'ns."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, I see; you are a refugee," answered the officer smiling. "Well, it's no
                        matter; have you seen any Union soldiers to-day?"</p>
                    <p>"Hain't seen nothin' else, much, but I've been lookin' mostly fo' a rebel.
                        'Spect you kin tell me wheah he is. I don' know--mebby it's you"-- the
                        latter doubtfully--"no, it's not you, cehtainly not you. You ain't Cap'n
                        Trenham, ah you?"</p>
                    <p>"I am Captain Trenham," said I stepping forward eagerly. "What do you want
                        with me?"</p>
                    <p>The boy looked me over critically. "It's a little mo' like it, but not what I
                        expected f'om <pb id="VAA3892-281" n="269"/> what she said. Is theah mo'
                        than one Cap'n Trenham?"</p>
                    <p>There was now a laugh at my expense and Sivad wanted to know what I had been
                        up to, being ignorant, like the others, that I had friends here. I knew that
                        the lad had come from Kate, but for what purpose? She had recognized me,
                        that was clear, but being with Betty had, for some reason, kept the
                        knowledge to herself.</p>
                    <p>"There is only one Captain Trenham, and I am he," said I quickly. "Speak;
                        what is it?"</p>
                    <p>He slowly put his hand in his trousers' pocket. "I've got something fo'
                        you--if I hain't lost it. No, heah it is."</p>
                    <p>There was a crackling of paper in his pocket as his fingers clutched
                        something, and he drew out a small envelope, crumpled and sweat-stained, and
                        passed it to me. There was no address of any kind on the outside. I broke
                        the seal and took out the enclosure, a half sheet of dainty letter paper.
                        This is what I read, evidently written in haste and trepidation:</p>
                    <p>"I saw you this morning; I can't be mistaken. B-- did not see you but she saw
                        the others. I did not see them. Union soldiers going by all morning. B--
                        gave information. I tried to prevent her; we quarreled and she called me a
                        rebel. Oh! Oh! Oh! They will send a large force, no doubt, for B-- says
                        there were hundreds. Save yourself and do it quickly if this reaches you, as
                            <pb id="VAA3892-282" n="270"/> I pray it may. I am doing something
                        terrible, but it is for you, <hi rend="i">not the others."</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>That was all, no signature, no names, but Kate's distressed face looked out
                        from every word. After reading I took out a match and setting fire to the
                        message watched it until it was consumed, then ground the blackened remnant
                        to dust between my palms. Until now I had remained silent, while Sivad and
                        the men about watched me curiously.</p>
                    <p>"Let the boy go," said I at last, absently, turning to those who had brought
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Sivad looked at me, flushing a little. "You forget, Captain Trenham, that I
                        command here," he said, with some irritation.</p>
                    <p>"Pardon me," I returned, thus recalled to myself.</p>
                    <p>I took him apart from the others and acquainted him with the character of the
                        information that had come to me, and his soldier spirit was aroused.</p>
                    <p>"We will take the road. I have already lost two-thirds of the brave fellows
                        who crossed the river with me and can do little with the handful that is
                        left, but that little shall be done."</p>
                    <p>Being a careful officer, Captain Sivad upon going into camp had posted
                        guards, and these he gave orders to call in, except those in the direction
                        of the highway, who could be taken up as we marched out of the wood. The
                        fact that no alarm had come from them assured us that <pb id="VAA3892-283"
                            n="271"/> there had been delay in sending an expedition against us, but
                        that we should meet our opposers somewhere neither Sivad nor I had the least
                        doubt. The boy who had brought the message, on being further questioned by
                        me while the men were bringing up their horses, said that he had left
                        Bellray's about eleven o'clock, but guessed that he would have started
                        sooner had he not been gone since early morning on another errand.</p>
                    <p>"Miss Katewus 'most crazy when I got home, no otha men folks about and Mistah
                        Rogah wo'se than nobody. He was wo'ked up that bad theah's no tellin',
                        seein' the soljah's way off theah, and declarin' the wah wus begun at last.
                        He's cehtainly crazy now, shuah nuff; don't know any mo' wheah I came f'om,
                        when it's only last wintah I run away f'om Geo'gy to keep f'om bein'
                        'scripted some day, and aftah wanderin' 'round freezin' and sta'vin' 'most
                        to death, he found me in New Albany, and tuk me home with 'im. He's not very
                        strong Union, but said I had no call to fight fo' the rebels ef I didn't
                        b'lieve they wus right. He gimme money to bring mothah no'th, fo' we weah
                        very po', but I hain't had no chance yet. Fathah, he's daid--shot one night

                        jes' like 'em."</p>
                    <p>He wiped a tear from his eye when he alluded to his family, and then
                        proceeded to deliver the subsequent opinion of human kind with philosophical
                        composure. He had got off the horse and stood holding it by the bridle. Just
                        now came an order to take saddles and he turned and looked at me
                        questioningly.</p>
                    <p>"Somebody he ah ain't got no hoss," he said.</p>
                    <p>"How do you know that?" I asked, starting guiltily at his words.</p>
                    <p>"I don' know much, but I ken see an' count, an' I've counted the hosses an'
                        theah's fo'ty-seven, an' then I counted you'ns an' theah's fo'ty-eight. <hi
                            rend="i">She</hi> said if Captain Trenham ain't got no hoss fo' him to

                        that's afoot tek Prince, else I wouldn't dah go back."</p>
                    <p>I felt my face grow red with embarrassment as I realized that her quick eyes
                        and keen intuition had correctly interpreted my unfortunate state, of which
                        I was myself painfully conscious. Several of the men during the day had
                        offered to surrender their mounts to me, and insisted when I refused, but I
                        could not bring myself to accept such a sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>A cavalryman without a horse flounders as badly as a fish on land and is
                        almost as helpless.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-285" n="273"/>
                    <p>They had then proposed to go out and "borrow" one from some near-by farmer,
                        but this I would not allow; nor would Sivad consent if I were willing to
                        pursue so summary a method, for to put it on no higher ground our position
                        was desperately precarious and required us to shun observation as far as
                        possible. So it happened that they had to be content with providing me with
                        a hat, an extra one that I could make answer being found somewhere among
                        their furnishings.</p>
                    <p>And now, if I did not accept the fine animal at my hand, I must abandon my
                        sorely pressed comrades. While I was hesitating the captain came up, already
                        mounted, and with him one of the men, a young fellow with fair hair, who, as
                        I had previously noticed, carried one arm in a sling from a recent wound. It
                        seemed to be a severe injury, for his manner was feverish and he appeared to
                        be in a bad way generally. He had been lying down all day, taking little
                        account of anything going on about him.</p>
                    <p>"Smith says he can't go any further," said Sivad; "swears that he will tumble
                        at the first gallop, and wants to lie right down here in the woods and
                        stay."</p>
                    <p>"That's right; I'm done fo' fo' a time, and the's no denyin' it," said Smith,
                        as he tottered off a little way, and stretched himself out on the grass in
                        the shade of a tree.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-286" n="274"/>
                    <p>Captain Sivad looked at the boy, whose eyes, with a strange light in them,
                        had followed the man on the ground. "Here, you runaway from Georgia, will
                        you take care of this man and get him some place where he can have a
                        doctor?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, suh, I will, an' I ought to; it's my brothah, Smith Hollen, the only
                        rebel in the family," replied the boy, with trembling voice.</p>
                    <p>He then walked quickly to the side of the sick man, and kneeling down called
                        his name. The other looked up, a flash of recognition in his eyes.</p>
                    <p>"Hello, little Bub; ain't you a long way f'om home?" Then reaching up his
                        sound arm he put it across the boy's shoulders, and the latter began to cry.
                        Stout-hearted lads they were, both of them, but human.</p>
                    <p>I went over and laid my hand on the younger's head and he lifted his face:
                        "Tell her that I thank her," I said.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, suh; cehtainly."</p>
                    <p>Thus we left them and the horse Prince, I riding the extra animal that had
                        been ridden by the refugee's brother. We had not proceeded more than half
                        the distance to the road when we heard some shots, and presently one of the
                        pickets came tearing through the timber which on this side was open enough
                        to admit of fair passage to horsemen. By reason of a slight rise in the
                        ground the road was not yet in view and we could not see the cause of his
                        haste, nor did we need. He <pb id="VAA3892-287" n="275"/> approached and
                        reported to the captain the presence of a troop of Federal cavalry and some
                        unmounted legionaries. The latter were entering the wood while the cavalry
                        remained in the road.</p>
                    <p>"That's not as bad as it might be," said Sivad to me. I was riding with him
                        at the head of his men.</p>
                    <p>We went flying forward and soon reached the summit of the rise. The
                        legionaries who were scattered about in our front at once opened a feverish
                        fire, which did us no damage as we swept along in open order. A sound of
                        firing coming from the direction of the camp we had left told that the foot
                        soldiers were also marching upon us through the wood. Our voluntary
                        departure had deprived them of the satisfaction of driving us.</p>
                    <p>The legionaries before us, not knowing our strength and probably believing it
                        to be much greater than it was, after firing another ineffectual round
                        apparently in increased excitement, broke from cover and ran pell-mell
                        toward the road, our fellows hammering after them like mad, jumping logs,
                        dodging low-hanging limbs and performing other feats made necessary by the
                        character of the ground.</p>
                    <p>Near the road there was less obstruction and we were able to draw together
                        and assume a more regular and efficient formation. But after all, the
                        approaching contest could be little better than a scampering, happy-go-lucky
                        affair on our side, <pb id="VAA3892-288" n="276"/> with the chances wofully
                        against us. For we now saw, instead of the single troop standing grimly off
                        to the eastward, ready to pounce upon us as soon as we should clear the
                        wood, another group of horsemen on our left which had hitherto been
                        concealed from us by a row of wild cherry trees. The legionaries, now seeing
                        our feeble numbers and emboldened thereby, stopped and renewed their fire
                        from behind the bank of a ravine on our right.</p>
                    <p>Captain Sivad, riding at my bridle, looked flushed and anxious. The two
                        troops of Federal cavalry remained motionless in their respective positions,
                        thus holding the road in both directions with a force superior to our
                        own.</p>
                    <p>"Ah!" cried Sivad, and then he shouted an order to halt that brought us to a
                        stand just at the margin of the road. "They think they have us."</p>
                    <p>The firing had ceased and two officers cantered toward us from the eastern
                        troop, one of them bearing a flag of truce. Sivad and I rode out to meet
                        them and they saluted us with great respect. After asking who was in command
                        one of the officers, a lieutenant, as his well-worn uniform proved, demanded
                        our surrender, asserting that we were hopelessly beset.</p>
                    <p>Without a moment's hesitation or wavering, Sivad refused, bluntly but
                        courteously, declaring that he still had fifty stout men, and that, though

                        chances on cutting a path for himself. The interview ended there, and again
                        saluting respectfully, as though we were not at once to begin cutting each
                        other's throats, both parties wheeled about and returned to the head of
                        their respective forces.</p>
                    <p>Waiting only long enough for the Federal officers to rejoin their troop and
                        report the futility of their errand we swung into the highway, but instead
                        of going to the eastward, we went west, straight toward the bunch of
                        blue-trousered troopers that filled the road to its edges. They got under
                        way with a shout and came on, much more eager for the fray, but not more
                        determined than we, who had been put to a choice of evils and had taken the
                        most manly and also the most hazardous and hopeless one. Before there was
                        time to calculate our chances with the foe before us, we struck with great
                        clash and outcry, our fresher horses giving us an impetus that sent us far
                        into their ranks; but these ranks were deep and as lusty as our own.</p>
                    <p>The animal I was riding, being spirited but too light for the work he was put
                        to, was at the onset struck squarely on the shoulder by a powerful charger
                        whose gleaming white teeth showed viciously at my saddle horn. The blow, by
                        reason of superior weight hurled my mount toward the edge of the line,
                        partly turning him about and <pb id="VAA3892-291" n="278"/> directly in
                        front of an officer whose sword was lifted to strike me.</p>
                    <p>The officer was Philip Deverny, and he uttered my name as he turned his
                        weapon aside. Just then came a flash and a report seemingly at my very face,
                        a shock and a sting, and I pitched headlong from my horse. The animal,
                        evidently a new acquisition and unused to battle, with no hand now at his
                        rein, dashed to one side snorting with fear, and dragged me after him, my
                        shoulders on the ground and one foot fast in the stirrup. How far I was
                        drawn along I can not tell, for presently I received a tremendous thump on
                        the head and knew no more.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">AND SOME DAY--</head>
                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">BOUT</hi> nine o'clock in the morning of the second day after
                        the events last related, two men rode at a leisurely pace out of the county
                        town of Corydon. One was a deputy of the district provost; the other was
                        Griswold.</p>
                    <p>"And so," said the latter, when they had got well beyond the town,
                        "proceedings against Bellray have been suspended."</p>
                    <p>"Yes," answered the deputy, a youngish man of good presence. "What else could
                        be done? The doctors declare that he is now <hi rend="i">non compos
                            mentis</hi>--which means, in plain English, that his mind is not
                        right--and they furthermore declare that he will never be any better until
                        his skull is repaired by some one who understands that sort of carpentry. It
                        seems that he was hurt three or four years ago, and their theory is that
                        that bullet of Spelker's traveled over the ground covered by the former
                        injury, and set his mental clock back to that time, completely wiping out
                        everything that has happened since."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-293" n="280"/>
                    <p>"It may be," said Griswold, thoughtfully, "that the old hurt explains his
                        recent conduct."</p>
                    <p>The other laughed. "I don't remember that all these other people had a knock
                        on the head, but it is possible. It would at least be a charitable thing to
                        believe."</p>
                    <p>"What has become of Spelker?" asked Griswold, after a while.</p>
                    <p>"Why, man, haven't I told you?" was the counter-query. "It was all simple
                        enough; a mountain fell on him, or something like that."</p>
                    <p>"What is the joke? I don't understand it."</p>
                    <p>"It is no joke at all; at any rate it was not to Spelker, nor would it be to
                        you or me if the same thing should happen to us," said the deputy seriously.
                        "He thought he had killed Roger Bellray--indeed, he boasted of it that night
                        in Corydon--and Bellray, whatever may be said of him, has many friends.
                        Within an hour or two after making his boast he got word in some way--and it
                        must have come to him very straight--that he had been marked by the brethren
                        of the acorn for slaughter. Now Spelker, as we all know, was more discreet
                        than valorous where his personal safety was concerned. So he put himself
                        under Captain Bracken's protection and started to leave the country for a
                        time. That very night Bracken's party with Spelker and another"--he paused
                        for a moment, looking at his companion; "well, I may as well tell you--it
                        can do no harm now as <pb id="VAA3892-294" n="281"/> his cake is dough here
                        anyway--and another, by name Vawter, a useful rascal if you don't trust him
                        too far, left town together, Vawter to rejoin his latest employer, then
                        uncomfortably near, and Bracken and the others to take boat somewhere along
                        the river for Louisville. Early in the morning they picked up Captain John
                        Trenham, who had taken the night to visit his mother, and carried him along
                        as prisoner of war. All this, remember, came to me last night in a report
                        from Bracken. Well, separating from Vawter, the captain pushed toward the
                        river and came upon it near Kinkle's Landing. He saw a packet coming up, and
                        as the road down was too far away, he, under Spelker's leadership, undertook
                        to make a short cut through a break in the bluffs. All that Bracken knows is
                        that from the side of the ravine hundreds of tons of limestone and earth
                        tumbled down on the two unfortunate men, and-- there they are. That is what
                        became of Spelker, and likewise of poor Trenham. I don't care much for the
                        horse-trader, for he was constantly swindling the government that he
                        professed to love and was an arrant coward to boot. As for Trenham, we have
                        one enemy the less."</p>
                    <p>"It was merited and quick retribution in his case, too," asserted Griswold,
                        solemnly.</p>
                    <p>"How so? And why retribution?"</p>
                    <p>"Because it was he that took the arms to Bellray's. It was for that purpose
                        he was out that <pb id="VAA3892-295" n="282"/> night instead of to pay a
                        visit to his mother," exclaimed Griswold, bitterly. "It was to arm the
                        people that you call 'brethren of the acorn' to stab us in the back while we
                        faced the raiders."</p>
                    <p>"Since you speak of that matter," returned the deputy, facing the other with
                        a suggestive smile, "I remember that I also have a letter from Vawter,
                        received yesterday morning at the hands of a reliable messenger, in which he
                        reports a narrow escape from a band of desperate characters to whom he
                        attributes some patriotism but more fear for their own skins. He says these
                        people carried him off to some underground place, mistaking him--and not
                        altogether without reason, it must be admitted--for a rebel spy working in
                        cahoots with the men of the acorn, and there forced from him, as the price
                        of his life, a confession as to how the arms came to be at Bellray's. He
                        says he told these men that Captain Trenham had them conveyed there, and
                        told them a lot of other stuff, all of which he asserts positively to be
                        untrue, and writes that he hastens to tell me, as the responsible man
                        hereabout, so that no mischief will result from his unwilling fairy
                        tale."</p>
                    <p>"Is that all he says?" asked Griswold, reddening.</p>
                    <p>"Practically all."</p>
                    <p>"Does he not say where these--these desperate <pb id="VAA3892-296" n="283"/>
                        people took him and what they did with him after he confessed?"</p>
                    <p>"No, the letter is very short, which he explains by saying that he had to
                        write left-handed, as he had that same night, after his inquisitors left
                        him, fallen and seriously injured his right arm."</p>
                    <p>"I don't wonder that he did," said Griswold, abstractedly.</p>
                    <p>"What's that?" asked the deputy,</p>
                    <p>"I don't wonder that he wrote a short letter if he had to do it left-handed.
                        It's a difficult thing for a right-handed man to do," responded the other,
                        escaping from his blunder.</p>
                    <p>If Vawter had seen fit to hold his tongue--for he must have heard his name
                        and Wysart's at least--he, Griswold, would do likewise, for the deputy
                        provost was a trifle jealous of his powers, and might not countenance
                        independent action, especially when it was directed against one of the
                        government's information gatherers.</p>
                    <p>They continued their journey in silence, save for a remark now and then on
                        matters not connected with this story, until they had traveled several
                        miles. Then Griswold, pointing to a large house with red chimneys standing
                        far back from the road, said:</p>
                    <p>"I wonder if the widow know?"</p>
                    <p>"How could she know?" answered the provost. "After I have withdrawn the guard
                        from <pb id="VAA3892-297" n="284"/> Bellray's I shall make it my painful
                        duty to stop and tell her--or I will let you do it."</p>
                    <p>"Excuse me from that service," said the other, throwing up his hand
                        protestingly. "Give me a command to meet a man and I will obey; but this is
                        a responsibility that I would evade, even though the family belongs to the
                        secesh."</p>
                    <p>Coming a mile further on, to the lane running from the public highway to
                        Roger Bellray's house they turned their horses into it. As they neared the
                        house they saw two persons, a man and a woman, on the shaded veranda. The
                        man was sitting in a rocking chair, a white bandage about his head; the
                        woman was seated on the outer edge of the floor, her feet resting on the
                        wide wooden steps. These two persons watched them as they approached, and
                        were plainly holding a conversation about them. When they reached the gate
                        only the provost's deputy dismounted. The girl--for it was Kate--rose to
                        receive him as he went up the walk. Roger made an effort to do likewise, but
                        she put out her hand and restrained him.</p>
                    <p>"I am well enough to receive my guests," he said, a little peevishly and yet
                        mildly, more as if he were stating a fact than protesting.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, Roger," she returned gently, "but they know you have been ill, and will
                        take your sitting as no discourtesy."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-298" n="285"/>
                    <p>The deputy came up to them while she was speaking, and understood.</p>
                    <p>"Keep your seat, Mr. Bellray," he said, after bowing to Kate. "I trust you
                        are improving, sir."</p>
                    <p>"Thank you; I am very much better, Mr.--, Mr.--, pardon me," he stammered
                        weakly; "my memory has become very treacherous, it seems, and your name
                        escapes me."</p>
                    <p>"Lancross, Francis Lancross."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, certainly; you are the friend of our guest, Mr. Shaw--a very
                        entertaining man, that Mr. Shaw, though he did talk very absurdly at first
                        about many impossible things, and"--laughing--"I did him the injustice to
                        think that something was the matter with his head. That didn't last long,
                        however, and he explained that he was a great joker. Like myself he voted
                        for Douglas, but he doesn't think there'll be any serious trouble; I hope he
                        is right, though I don't understand why so many soldiers were going by the
                        other day--something very unusual--never heard of the like before. The
                        outlook is very bad. But pardon me again; you may not take such an interest
                        in politics as I do, and my sister, who is an excellent nurse for one so
                        young, tells me that I should put it all out of my head until I am
                        completely recovered."</p>
                    <p>"It is always better to take the advice of one's doctor and
                        nurse--particularly that of the nurse," <pb id="VAA3892-299" n="286"/> said
                        Lancross, good-naturedly. "But we men make poor patients, Mr. Bellray; we
                        are too much inclined to have our own way, and it's not always the best way,
                        either." Then he added: "If you will excuse me, sir, I should like a word
                        with Miss Bellray." With that he turned toward Kate and the two went into
                        the house.</p>
                    <p>Now the deputy provost was only an official sojourner at Corydon, to which
                        place he had been sent to investigate the temper of some of the inhabitants
                        of that region with respect to proposed war measures. Rumors had been widely
                        circulated that in many parts of the state there was to be organized
                        resistance to conscriptions, and there had been many sporadic outbreaks
                        already. Not only that, but it was also reported that dissatisfied persons
                        were preparing to give armed aid at the first opportunity to the forces of
                        the Confederate government.</p>
                    <p>It was known that secret political societies--always to be condemned in a
                        free country--had been numerously established in many of the loyal states,
                        with purposes and aims so obscure to the uninitiated as to arouse a
                        suspicion which finally ended in resentment and bitter opposition. The
                        leaders in these societies asserted their lawful character, and protested
                        that their object was merely to conserve the principles of constitutional
                        government during a period of great excitement; that they stood between the
                        rebellious destructionists <pb id="VAA3892-300" n="287"/> on the one hand
                        and the loose construetionists on the other; and that, while they denounced
                        and gave no aid to the first, they reserved the right to criticise any
                        disregard of the constitution by the latter.</p>
                    <p>It is no doubt true that the great majority of those who made up the
                        membership of these associations in the middle northern states were honest
                        and patriotic according to their view of the times. But that there were
                        selfish, reckless and scheming men among them, as well as others so
                        naturally fond of excitements and intrigues as to care little for results
                        and give light consideration to means, is beyond question.</p>
                    <p>It was not apparent then, however, and has never been clearly shown since
                        that these societies were in fact treasonable. That there was here and there
                        a man among them who was disloyal, and who held intercourse with the enemies
                        of the government, is no doubt true. The population in many parts of
                        southern Indiana was made up largely of families and the descendents of
                        families who had emigrated from the seceding states, where generations of
                        their forefathers had lived and died, and where they still had numerous
                        kinfolk. The memories and traditions of the southland were still fresh, and
                        gave rise to sentiments that hampered them in choosing their course in the
                        great conflict between the sections.</p>
                    <p>It is not, therefore, strange that men who would <pb id="VAA3892-301" n="288"
                        /> have been the fierce partisans of their government in a war with a
                        foreign power now held back, and in their uncertainty of purpose knew not
                        where to turn. This was one class from which the ill-advised secret
                        societies were recruited. It was to this class that Roger Bellray
                        belonged.</p>
                    <p>These societies were of course known to the government, which at first gave
                        them little attention. But as time went on and feeling grew into a veritable
                        fever of passion, when men disputed with each other without toleration, when
                        personal quarrels became neighborhood feuds and these in turn presaged a
                        nightmare of anarchy, the authorities sent agents abroad under instructions
                        to act as occasion demanded.</p>
                    <p>Bellray was, as I have already endeavored to make clear, a man who spoke with
                        great freedom and fearlessness, and though no honest man could be found who
                        would depose to any overt act of his that could be tortured into treasonable
                        conduct, there were many to denounce his expressed sentiments. It was soon
                        clearly established that he, with others, frequently met in secret, but for
                        what purpose could only be conjectured. That they were well informed as to
                        each other and did not desire the association of outsiders was settled by
                        the failure of shrewd secret agents to gain their confidence and obtain
                        access to their meetings; in some localities, however, these agents met with
                        better success, as Vawter <pb id="VAA3892-302" n="289"/> had somewhere
                        become a member of the general order. Of these men Bellray was the
                        unquestioned leader--his the guiding and directing mind.</p>
                    <p>When it became apparent to the provost's deputy that an invasion was
                        imminent, he caused steps to be taken for the arrest and detention of
                        Bellray as a precautionary measure, governing himself by the saying that
                        where there is smoke there must be fire. Captain Bracken's bungling had
                        given him great concern, for the death of so powerful a man, with so
                        numerous a following as he was known to possess, under such circumstances
                        might provoke a great commotion and increase a bitterness that good policy
                        should strive to allay rather than to crush. When it came to him early the
                        next morning that Bellray was not dead, but only wounded, the Confederate
                        cavalry was engaged with the legionaries at the town's gates. Later in the
                        day, when the invaders, after capturing, had left the town and swept on to
                        the north, he went to Bellray's house and, learning the situation, left a
                        single guard until he could get word as to his further course from his
                        superiors.</p>
                    <p>It was immediately after Lancross went away that Griswold, Wysart and some
                        others rode up, they having followed for some time, at a safe distance, the
                        track of the raiders. The former had received from some anonymous source
                        information <pb id="VAA3892-303" n="290"/> that under the floor, at the
                        corner of the house where Bellray's workroom was, fire-arms would be found.
                        The identity of the betrayer was never disclosed, but when these facts
                        became known to me my thoughts reverted to what Roger had said on the night
                        of my departure for the South, to the effect that those in whom one most
                        confided might be the first to prove false.</p>
                    <p>A search revealed that the person who directed this treacherous blow at the
                        man who had already paid such a heavy penalty for his mistaken conduct was
                        not writing at random, although Wysart and one or two others, when the
                        matter was first laid before them, pooh-poohed and declared that it was
                        preposterous to think that a man of Bellray's sense and standing would do
                        such a thing.</p>
                    <p>When the discovery was made, Roger, who had followed the men--for he would go
                        about--was more genuinely astounded than any other, and laughed to think
                        that he should have such a treasure without knowing it, while Kate looked
                        on, pale, tearful and silent. Wysart, it was noticed, talked a great deal,
                        and as the party rode off was more violent in his denunciation than any of
                        his companions. I fancied, when I heard about it, that possibly he had a
                        thought of himself.</p>
                    <p>It was not until the next morning that the matter was reported to Lancross,
                        but he did not see fit to change his plans as to Bellray, though he decided
                        to redouble his vigilance in general. And <pb id="VAA3892-304" n="291"/> now
                        he had come to say that he had received instructions directing him until
                        further orders to do nothing more in Roger's case. It was about this that he
                        desired to talk with Kate.</p>
                    <p>"I am glad to say," he began, when they were beyond the hearing of Roger,
                        "that proceedings against your brother have been suspended and I have come
                        to withdraw the guard."</p>
                    <p>"I can not tell you how happy it makes me to hear it," Kate said, overjoyed,
                        and with tears springing to her eyes. Then she added, sorrowfully: "But what
                        worse thing could the government do than it has already done? It has robbed
                        him of his mind, and almost made a rebel of me."</p>
                    <p>"The shooting was very unfortunate, and none the less so because done against
                        positive orders," returned Lancross. "But the man who boasted of the deed
                        has dearly paid for it."</p>
                    <p>"How?" she asked, quickly.</p>
                    <p>"With his life," was the answer.</p>
                    <p>"If he has been executed so soon," she said, dropping her eyes, "then you
                        tried him by courtmartial--or did you give him a trial? Oh, I am sorry you
                        did not wait, for he did not, after all, kill my brother."</p>
                    <p>"He was not tried by any human court or power; he was killed by accident,"
                        explained the deputy.</p>
                    <p>"Poor man!" said Kate.</p>
                    <p>A few minutes later she stood by her brother's <pb id="VAA3892-305" n="292"/>
                        chair watching the departure of the deputy and Griswold, now accompanied by
                        the guard, Shaw. She gave a sigh of relief; at last she could speak and act
                        freely, for though the surveillance had been nominal, it was nevertheless
                        irritating. Roger began to talk to her and she answered him absently; her
                        gaze was upon the three horsemen galloping along the highway. In a little
                        while she cried out in a startled voice:</p>
                    <p>"Oh, they are going there!"</p>
                    <p>"Going where?" asked Roger, who had ceased to think about the men.</p>
                    <p>"To Trenham's," she answered, her voice shaking.</p>
                    <p>"Well, why shouldn't they? They are gentlemen, I am sure, and it may be that
                        they have business with Mr. Trenham," he said, alluding to my deceased
                        father.</p>
                    <p>"I pray God that they have not," she returned forgetfully, thinking of
                        me.</p>
                    <p>"Why, how strangely you talk, my dear child," said Roger, looking at her in
                        amazement and still speaking from that past in which he now lived. "One
                        would think from what you say that something terrible might happen."</p>
                    <p>"And so it may, oh, so it may," she cried, still in the moving present.</p>
                    <p>"Kate, what could happen? Your manner disturbs me," Roger said, reaching out
                        and taking her hand, which was trembling.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-306" n="293"/>
                    <p>She came to herself with a start and looked concernedly at her brother,
                        attempting to smile but failing.</p>
                    <p>"What did I say? I fear that my nerves are not as strong as I have
                        believed."</p>
                    <p>"You said something terrible might happen at Trenham's."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, Roger, you must not tell--remember you must not tell--but young Mr.
                        Trenham is at home, desperately hurt, and visitors might annoy him;" then,
                        kneeling by his side, she leaned her head upon the chair arm and broke into
                        tears.</p>
                    <p>"There, there; don't cry. He is strong and will come along all right. He is a
                        fine lad and some day--" he stopped.</p>
                    <p>"And some day?" she repeated questioningly, to draw him on, but he remained
                        silent, the whole matter having seemingly passed from his mind.</p>

                    <p>F<hi rend="sc">OR</hi> a strong-willed, self-reliant girl Kate had greatly
                        given way to fear when she saw the deputy provost and his companions going
                        toward my mother's house, where I had found myself on regaining my senses
                        the morning before. But heaven knows that there had been occurrences enough
                        in the past four days to unsettle nerves even stronger than hers. What with
                        the shooting of her brother, the boisterous passing of my General's men, the
                        eager pursuit by the Union soldiery, the damning discovery of Roger's guilty
                        store, together with the general confusion and disorder, it was not strange
                        that she should have been moved more than others by the doubt, distrust and
                        alarm that racked the community. And now to all these things had been added
                        my own then unexplained misfortune.</p>
                    <p>Her situation was so singular, so entirely different from that of any other
                        person, as to be well-nigh unbearable. Her pride had been touched but her
                        heart bled; and with it all, making her lot harder to endure, was the
                        realization of her own weakness, and her belief that she must be <pb
                            id="VAA3892-308" n="295"/> dependent upon the mercy of those for whom
                        she had so often and so resolutely contended.</p>
                    <p>To high natures the dominant impulse is to demand; to such it is torture to
                        entreat, and if the supplication must be addressed to friends the sharpness
                        of the pain is increased by an added humiliation, more keen, I think, than
                        comes from submission to an over-strong and successful enemy whom we have
                        opposed to the extent of our powers.</p>
                    <p>She was in a frame of mind to imagine the happening of direful things, as
                        indeed she might, considering the inflamed condition of the people. Our bold
                        riders had gone like a tornado through the county, levying quick tribute as
                        they went. With enemies springing up as thick as leaves about them, and
                        knowing that relentless pursuers were at their heels, they did not parley
                        about terms but helped themselves. The condition was one of the General's
                        own making and he might have foreseen the desperate straits to which he was
                        afterward driven. But confidence in his men and in himself, and faith in the
                        fortune that had never before forsaken him led him on.</p>
                    <p>His undertaking was not inspired by vainglory; it was not a mere desperate
                        attempt to win renown for himself. Of that I am satisfied. He unselfishly
                        sought to loosen the bands that, were strangling his chief in the South, to
                        give him an opportunity to breathe, a greater freedom and a chance <pb
                            id="VAA3892-309" n="296"/> to save the great army committed to him. In a
                        measure he succeeded, but at such a pitiful cost to himself. Nearly a
                        hundred thousand men were called to arms to oppose him, and a large part of
                        these were sent into the field. His struggle to save his command, as will be
                        seen, was heroic, but it ended in tragedy.</p>
                    <p>Military ethics--if there be such a thing--naturally could find small place
                        in his plans during the wild ride he had entered upon through the very heart
                        of a hostile country. It was not equitable that his men should ask only
                        their own consent in trading their wearied horses for fresh ones as they
                        went along, but I reflect that his Unionist pursuers did likewise. Nor can
                        many other acts charged and treasured against them be justified by any known
                        moral principle.</p>
                    <p>And yet there is a code, recognized in all times, under the tenets of which
                        they stand excused--the code of military necessity. I do not include under
                        this term the appropriation of skates in July, of birds in cages and of
                        bolts of red calico, isolated instances of which are recorded against these
                        troopers, who seemed eager in the first stages of their march to make a jest
                        of their danger.</p>
                    <p>What I do hold is that my General had abundant precedent for the gravest acts
                        which can justly be laid at his door as commander by those who suffered at
                        his hands. And I ask of them, in <pb id="VAA3892-310" n="297"/> that good
                        spirit which has since come to smooth away the wrinkles of that time of
                        strife and wipe out the bitterness then aroused, to consider the smoking
                        waste along the Shenandoah as more than compensation for their losses.</p>
                    <p>But standing in the very presence of the invasion, with the thud of hoofs,
                        the rattle of sabers and the boom of cannon yet fresh in their ears, and the
                        earth still damp and yellow over the graves of valiant defenders, the great
                        mass of the people in the county where I lay might have little inclination
                        to search for precedents, whether such be usual or otherwise.</p>
                    <p>It was fear of them that filled Kate--fear, not of Lancross, who represented
                        authority, but of Griswold, who stood for the right of the people to act for
                        themselves, independent of authority. Was it not one of the latter class who
                        had attempted to slay her brother?</p>
                    <p>Thus she reasoned, not knowing that Griswold, with natural moderation, had
                        already done much to temper the feeling against her poor, bewildered
                        brother; not knowing further, as she could not, indeed, that he would
                        afterward perform the same service for myself, whose escape from death was
                        by such a narrow margin that I take to myself no credit for living at
                        all.</p>
                    <p>When I pitched from my horse during the fight in the road the frightened
                        animal had dashed into the woods. Young Sam Hollen, returning in <pb
                            id="VAA3892-311" n="298"/> the night with civilian apparel with which to
                        clothe his wounded brother before taking him to Sutton's house, who had
                        agreed to harbor him only on that condition, had heard a groan.
                        Investigation disclosed my body tightly wedged between the forks of a large
                        log, a position which had no doubt been instrumental in my escape from
                        capture as well as from the entangling stirrup, which, with a part of the
                        broken strap, was lying at my feet.</p>
                    <p>From there, during the night, with help brought by the refugee, I was
                        conveyed to my mother's house, where I was found to have not only a
                        dangerous shot wound in the side, but a broken arm and so many contusions
                        and scratches that it was not thought profitable to take account of
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Captain Sivad, with the larger part of his small force, had got away, but
                        many remained, and of these some were beyond mortal aid, as were likewise
                        some of their opponents. Heaven pity us for those days! A young Union
                        officer had scrutinized every face carefully, the lad said to me when I was
                        able to hear his story, and seemed surprised and yet relieved when one for
                        whom he was apparently looking was not found. That, thought I, was Philip
                        Deverny.</p>
                    <p>The provost's deputy, feeling it to be his humane, if not official, duty to
                        acquaint my mother with what he supposed to be the fact of her son's death,
                        went straight to her door in pursuance of <pb id="VAA3892-312" n="299"/> his
                        melancholy mission, and inquiring for her, was shown in and seated until she
                        could be called. She was not long in coming, and there was that in her face
                        which showed that she was in deep trouble, causing Lancross to think that
                        possibly she had already heard what he had come to say. He was unknown to
                        her and introduced himself.</p>
                    <p>"Madam," he said, "I am Francis Lancross, deputy provost for this
                        district."</p>
                    <p>She bowed and was silent, her hand upon her heart, which began a painful
                        beating when he revealed his official character.</p>
                    <p>"I have come to speak to you about your son, and my duty is a most unhappy
                        one," he continued.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, sir," she cried at this, "you certainly do not mean to disturb him; he
                        can not be moved yet."</p>
                    <p>"I do not understand," said the deputy, greatly puzzled. "I--I have nothing
                        to do with removing him; that is a matter for you to determine. I did not
                        know that you had heard. Pardon me for adding to your distress. My sole
                        purpose was to perform a painful service."</p>
                    <p>"Nor do I understand," said my mother, her face showing a deeper perplexity,
                        but determined to solve the riddle, the relating of which to me afterward
                        caused an amusement that, I am sure, did not do my wounds any good. "We are
                        clearly at cross-purposes. You speak with great <pb id="VAA3892-313" n="300"
                        /> kindness, sir, and I thank you for that. But what would you tell me about
                        my son?"</p>
                    <p>"Only of his death, of which sad fact you seem to be already informed,"
                        replied the deputy, rising. "My intrusion was well meant, madam, and that
                        must be my excuse for troubling you."</p>
                    <p>"Stay," she said, with a detaining gesture, as he was about to go. "My son is
                        dangerously injured but not dead, and he exacted a promise from me this
                        morning that if one in authority should come he was to be told of it. I did
                        not think it wise, but you know that a mother's heart and a son's head are
                        not always in accord."</p>
                    <p>Saying nothing, for his amazement was so profound that he could formulate no
                        fitting speech, and with a strong doubt of Bracken's trustworthiness, he
                        waited while my mother, excusing herself, came up the stairs to notify me of
                        his presence. At my request, and only staying long enough to tell me the
                        nature of his mission, she returned below and showed the visitor up.</p>
                    <p>"I am told that you are Mr. Lancross, the deputy provost," I said, as he took
                        a seat near my bedside, looking very concerned and serious, as if half
                        disposed to take me for some strange kind of ghost.</p>
                    <p>"I am that person," he answered, as if his own identity, at least, was not
                        doubtful; "and I suppose that you are Captain Trenham, lately <pb
                            id="VAA3892-314" n="301"/> with the rebel general who has turned us
                        upside down around here?"</p>
                    <p>"The same, and I am glad to see you; the more so because I am told that you
                        do not visit us officially."</p>
                    <p>"The meeting is very unexpected on my part," returned the deputy. "Until a
                        few minutes ago I had reason to believe that I would never have the pleasure
                        of looking upon your face. Captain Bracken's report was very unfavorable,
                        indeed."</p>
                    <p>In spite of my many pains I was forced to smile. Bandaged and plastered, and
                        unsightly as I knew myself to be, his pleasure at seeing me then could not
                        have been great, and so I told him, in jest, which set him to laughing and
                        put us both more at our ease. A bit of humor is often very useful by way of
                        laying a foundation for serious things, and I had a trouble that I much
                        desired to get rid of. It was about my person. I could neither get away nor
                        hope to remain long undiscovered, and so I surrendered to him then and there
                        and asked that he arrange for my parole. This he agreed to do, and afterward
                        formally executed the agreement. It was the best I could do, not what I
                        wished. But it took a great load off the mind of my mother, who for two days
                        had trembled and turned pale every time she heard the grind of a wheel or
                        the step of a horse's foot, and for that much, at least, I was thankful.</p>

                    <p>M<hi rend="sc">Y</hi> active career as a soldier was at an end, as time
                        proved, but it chanced that I was to play a part--small though it was--in
                        the closing act of the ill-starred enterprise by which so many were undone.
                        Of that I shall speak; but before I do so I must tell how it fared with
                        those from whom I had been separated by the treachery of Vawter.</p>
                    <p>So far as concerned that locality where my mother lived I had been willing
                        enough to remain more an on-looker than to be a participant in events. But
                        once beyond it I can truthfully assert that I would have taken my place with
                        my fellows without any qualms of conscience, and with no motive for action
                        other than the commands of my General. As it is, it almost seems to me--so
                        keen was my interest--that I galloped with them along the roads by which
                        they made their desperate progress, and that I participated in the
                        misfortunes by which they were at last overwhelmed.</p>
                    <p>The advance felt its way toward Corydon that first morning in Indiana, and
                        well in front were <pb id="VAA3892-316" n="303"/> my own men, contrary to
                        what I had planned for them. But of that they were ignorant. A few hundred
                        legionaries, with a courage far greater than their strength, sought to check
                        this audacious rebel host. From their rude, hastily constructed breastworks
                        they sent forth a very gallant fire. But it was snuffed out like a match in
                        a tempest, and the men who pulled the triggers were first enveloped in the
                        cloud of gray, then disarmed and cast aside. This was the first obstacle
                        since the invasion was accomplished. And how soon it came! Though failing to
                        do more, it did cause a little delay, and delay in such a situation is
                        everything. Even then the thousands of blue-garbed pursuers were at
                        Brandenburg.</p>
                    <p>Onward! Through the town clattered the rebel hoofs and rumbled the rebel
                        cannon, and the great game of "fox and geese" was under way. What a
                        fluttering of wings there was, what consternation, and yet what a
                        determination arose to run this gray fox to earth!</p>
                    <p>The next morning, Salem, fifty miles inland, and two hundred removed from any
                        hope of help! Already thousands had hurried to arms and other thousands were
                        concentrating for hasty equipment. Behind, the roads shook with the tread of
                        the cavalry that had followed from the South. Against this one, a dozen
                        generals were laying plans, organizing and transporting forces. Halffrantic
                        telegrams were passing over the hot wires <pb id="VAA3892-317" n="304"/>
                        between Louisville, Indianapolis and Cincinnati, and countless lesser
                        places. Alarm bells were ringing in every town and village and hamlet.</p>
                    <p>The enemy must be cornered. But the gray fox knew how to turn and to wind in
                        and out, never losing his direction. And he also knew how to show his teeth.
                        Reports of his movements conflicted and put him first here and then there,
                        and the bewildered foes knew not where to strike. They made ready at many
                        places and moved according to their information. Country people and townsmen
                        along the invader's track were in a state of alarm bordering on panic. Not
                        accustomed to beholding any considerable body of soldiers, and none that
                        were hostile, they vastly overrated the numbers of my General's men.
                        Besides, they were expecting to have their throats cut, and an expectation
                        of this character is not conducive to a calm judgment of things and
                        events.</p>
                    <p>On and on, under the blazing summer sun, with little sleep and little rest!
                        As by magic, the whole population knew that three thousand horsemen were
                        running a race--the most astounding race in history--with death or captivity
                        the penalty for losing; a race with the telegraph and steam cars, and the
                        unnumbered foes that growled about them and behind them and forced them on.
                        And far ahead other hosts were gathering <pb id="VAA3892-318" n="305"/> to
                        harry them and to drive them this way and that.</p>
                    <p>The atmosphere was charged with excitement and fear, and danger lurked
                        everywhere. Unharvested wheat stood over-ripe and neglected in the fields.
                        Husbandmen had suddenly become soldiers, and in masses were being rushed
                        here and there along the invader's track. Never did pioneers work with such
                        desperate energy clearing the primeval forests as did men now work to block
                        with felled trees the roads that they had taken such pains to make. The
                        sound of the ax, the crash of falling trees, mingled with the shouts of men,
                        the clatter of shod hoofs and the crack of guns. Far aloft spread the smoke
                        of burning bridges, destroyed by the General to hinder his enemies.</p>
                    <p>The fox must be hemmed in. But not yet was it to be. He did not fear the
                        legionaries or raw recruits, numberless as they were. It was the foe behind,
                        and those other well-trained soldiers hastening up from the war region and
                        rising like a cloud far in his front, for whom he was on the lookout. The
                        broad river was on his right hand, and it was now alive with armed craft
                        ready to pounce upon him if he should attempt to recross. On his left, for
                        hundreds of miles to the northward, was a country filled with enemies
                        desiring his destruction. In opposition to these conditions was the fertile
                        brain and daring spirit of <pb id="VAA3892-319" n="306"/> one man and the
                        strong arms of his faithful followers.</p>
                    <p>North Vernon, Versailles and Sunman Station! It was now Monday morning, and
                        four days since the river was crossed--days of hard riding and strategy,
                        with scant time for rest. The beginning of a new week; what would the end of
                        it be? The air was filled now with murmurings of rapidly concentrating foes
                        pouring forward from the middle North in excited streams like the rising
                        tides of the sea. The alarm bells had aroused the people. From shop and
                        store and field, from office and counting room, they came, eager, untried,
                        and with nerves tremulous with tension.</p>
                    <p>What way would the fox turn? He did not turn. Straight ahead he rode, passing
                        the Indiana border and thundering upon the highways of Ohio. And now ninety
                        miles in a day and a night he went, while on his right two Unionist forces,
                        each in the darkness believing the other to be the invader, fell into
                        furious conflict and drenched the soil they were there to defend with their
                        own blood.</p>
                    <p>On and on he swept, brushing aside one foe and eluding another, defying the
                        telegraph, the steam cars, the dozen generals, the swarming thousands
                        --night and day, day and night. His men were of iron, but iron will break
                        when eaten by rust, and into these men was eating the rust of tremendous
                        exertion without rest. There was no <pb id="VAA3892-320" n="307"/> time for
                        recuperation, no time to replace the vitality that was being constantly
                        expended.</p>
                    <p>A few of the weaker dropped from their saddles and were picked up from the
                        wayside by pursuers, some of whom were now treading on their very heels. At
                        halts others fell into the slumber of exhaustion from which their officers
                        could arouse them with difficulty. But once in the saddle again, they
                        pressed on with mocking laughter for their foes and hearts beating high with
                        courage. Their chief was in the van, and what he could endure they would
                        endure, and where he led they would follow as long as they could keep their
                        leaden feet in the stirrups.</p>
                    <p>On, for six days more, through storm and shine they rode. It was the first
                        day of a new week, Sunday. They had drawn toward the river Ohio, now in
                        unseasonable flood, a yellow, rushing, foaming barrier between them and the
                        more friendly Kentucky. It seemed that God was against them. Here was
                        Buffington Island where the General had thought to cross, but here also his
                        enemies lay in wait to thwart him, to drive him back. And here they fought,
                        these wearied men --these men almost dead in their saddles--with these
                        others, fought and died. On again, but there were hundreds of their fellows
                        who could not follow.</p>
                    <p>Only twelve hundred were left of the three thousand. But the foe followed,
                        that foe which <pb id="VAA3892-321" n="308"/> crossed at Brandenburg, as
                        determined and hardy as the quarry he was pursuing. And other opposers
                        poured forth from every town and village and middle-west army post, on foot
                        and horseback and railway train. They patrolled the highways; they watched
                        from hill and tree top; and they waited in wood and field the coming of the
                        presumptuous rebel.</p>
                    <p>A great roar filled the midsummer air, growing louder day by day. The earth
                        shook under the tramp of new legions. All business was suspended. Nothing
                        was thought of but the raider who for weeks had eluded and baffled his
                        enemies in three states, and turned upon himself the eyes of millions. For
                        his splendid courage he was lauded; for his blindness he was condemned. He
                        was foredoomed to failure and disaster, but he was winning the future
                        admiration of the world, and the present respect of those who were straining
                        every nerve and muscle and brain cell to bring about his overthrow. But not
                        yet was it accomplished.</p>
                    <p>The same day, twenty miles above Buffington Island he came again to the
                        margin of the broad river. Here he resolved to breast its sweeping flood.
                        Orders were given and the men rode in as they would ride upon the green
                        sward or upon the dusty road, reckless of risk and danger. Those in advance
                        were far out toward the southern shore when the gunboats of the Federals <pb
                            id="VAA3892-322" n="309"/> suddenly appeared. The General himself was in
                        midstream, his powerful horse swimming gallantly. Looking back, he saw that
                        it was impossible for the rest of his command to effect a passage of the
                        stream in the teeth of the enemy's fire that was now being directed against
                        them, against him and those about him, against those others now nearing the
                        green soil of Kentucky. He guided his horse around and went back in the hail
                        of shot, to remain with the remnant of his command to the end.</p>
                    <p>Only eight hundred were now left to him of the three thousand, and these
                        eight hundred pressed on again. The sun went down but still they pressed on,
                        through the twilight and into the night to a point off Blennerhasset's
                        Island, where three score years before Aaron Burr unfolded to the English
                        scholar his plans for a southwestern empire.</p>
                    <p>Not so quiet as then were these somber shores. Coming from all directions,
                        even from the south where lay the river, its bosom shimmering under the
                        lights of the armed patrols, were the pursuing hunters, who now believed
                        that the object of the chase was surrounded and without chance of escape.
                        They moved in and shut off all means of egress, save on one side where an
                        abrupt mountain barred the way like a mighty wall which no man, they
                        thought, would dare attempt to scale. One man did dare and eight hundred
                        followed, in <pb id="VAA3892-323" n="310"/> single file, in the darkness. Up
                        and up, stumbling, falling; up and up, winding around, and then down and
                        down and away, while the foe awaited the coming of the dawn to finish the
                        work of destruction.</p>
                    <p>On again, toward the east, rode these men so desperately tired and so
                        desperately beset. For six days more they moved, sometimes thrown to the
                        right or to the left, sometimes hurled back, hampered, harrassed, but
                        forward toward the east. A cloud of dust marked their march and revealed
                        their presence, and other clouds of dust rose to mark the paths of the
                        hunters.</p>
                    <p>It is incredible that men can endure what these men suffered. They were in
                        the saddle twenty-one hours out of each twenty-four. From day to day they
                        were killed or captured, singly or in groups. Everywhere they were met by
                        fresh companies of legionaries which swarmed and buzzed about them, and
                        often darted upon the flanks or upon the rear and stung. The uproar and
                        confusion increased; the shouts of men, the trampling of hoofs, the rattle
                        of equipment, and the guns and sabers of the on-rushing thousands flashed
                        and gleamed in the blistering sun.</p>
                    <p>But the grim man in gray rode on. Until he was overthrown there would be no
                        rest for pursuers or pursued. What mattered it that his force had been
                        bitten and torn until only a weary fragment remained? It was the leader who
                        was important, <pb id="VAA3892-324" n="[]"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA3892-6"/>
                        <pb id="VAA3892-325" n="311"/> not his followers--this bold chieftain who so
                        often had ridden far and wide unchecked. And just now the President of the
                        United States, the great Lincoln, was making anxious inquiries as to his
                        whereabouts.</p>
                    <p>Another Sunday dawned, the 26th of July. Far in eastern Ohio rode three
                        hundred men--three hundred of the three thousand, and many of these,
                        feverish almost to delirium from wounds received in fierce fights on
                        previous days, reeled in their saddles as they went. They were two miles
                        beyond the village of Gavers, the General at the front of his scant
                        column.</p>
                    <p>What meant that hurtling cloud of dust ahead? And what meant that yellow
                        cloud behind and that other rising over the Highlandtown road? Nearer and
                        nearer approached these signs of the enemy. The scant column came to a halt,
                        and, as it did so, across the fields dashed the Unionist cavalry. From every
                        direction, it seemed, they streamed toward these hunted men in such numbers
                        that it was folly to resist.</p>
                    <p>The gray fox was cornered at last in the open, but he had led a long chase.
                        He surrendered to a man believed by him to be a captain of militia, and made
                        quick terms for parole. These terms the Union general would not allow,
                        whereupon Morgan demanded that he be put upon the field again where he was,
                        and avowed that he would fight them to the end. But this was the end; the
                            <pb id="VAA3892-326" n="312"/> race had been run. Beneath his horse's
                        feet five hundred heart-breaking miles had sped. The telegraph, the steam
                        cars, the dozen generals, the swarming thousands, had won, and for the
                        losers who lived there was only the prison.</p>
                    <p>Was anything accomplished by them save their own destruction? I will answer,
                        yes; the victory six weeks later by Bragg's Confederate army in the great
                        battle of Chickamauga, when the two forces there engaged lost more than
                        thirty thousand men.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> was these things that were happening, these and so many
                        more, while I was complaining of my own poor ills. Even to my ears, secluded
                        as I was, from time to time came word of the bitter progress of my comrades.
                        But for many days reports were so meager and unsatisfactory that I could not
                        make head or tail of them. When the end came, however, and the news was
                        flashed from city to town, and thence to hamlet and farmstead, that the bold
                        and far-famed raider was a prisoner in Ohio, the middle North sent forth a
                        shout of rejoicing that I could understand, but in which I could not
                        join.</p>
                    <p>Far and near the heavens were alight with the bonfires of victory, and cannon
                        and anvil thundered and crashed in very joy over my General's capture. I did
                        not blame them--these people of the North--as I am sure he did not. We are
                        all disposed to make the most of our successes, and when the war spirit is
                        on us we are likely to give extravagant expression to our feelings. But I
                        think I might have been spared the experience--though <pb id="VAA3892-328"
                            n="314"/> I was in a manner responsible for it--to which I was subjected
                        for being one of the invaders. During the progress of the raid my short
                        connection with it had apparently been overlooked. Now I was to be suddenly
                        remembered and made disagreeably conspicuous at a time when, had I been
                        allowed to make a choice, I would have remained in the retirement to which
                        my misadventures had consigned me.</p>
                    <p>Less than two miles away, at the crossing of the roads, stood, in one angle,
                        a school-house and in another a blacksmith shop. No other buildings were
                        near except the house of the smith, yet it was the favorite meeting place
                        for the country folk round about. Here it was that they heard political
                        speeches, and here it was, also, that they gathered to consult together
                        about the state of the war and to celebrate victories achieved by the Union
                        arms.</p>
                    <p>At the celebrations the smith's anvils were used as a substitute for cannon
                        in noise-making, and these I heard one night as I sat, still bandaged and
                        sore, on my mother's porch. My broken arm was useless and would so remain
                        for many a day, but the wound in my side had healed so rapidly that I felt
                        no further danger from it. The night being very warm and dry, I had
                        determined to stay up as late as I dared rather than endure the confinement
                        of my room.</p>
                    <p>The distant explosions under the anvils boomed <pb id="VAA3892-329" n="315"/>
                        out now and then, showing that much powder was being burned. Between them,
                        and less distinctly, came sounds of cheering. To me these noises aroused
                        melancholy reflections, as may well be believed, but along with them came a
                        feeling of relief that the strain was over, and a satisfaction in knowing
                        that my one arm would have availed nothing at last.</p>
                    <p>Presently the sound of wheels coming furiously up the lane took my attention.
                        A carriage stopped at the gate and some one sprang out and ran toward the
                        house. It was Kate Bellray.</p>
                    <p>"Is Roger here?" she asked without ceremony, pausing at the steps. It was not
                        light enough where she stood to see her face clearly, but her voice showed
                        great agitation.</p>
                    <p>"No," said I, wondering, as I got to my feet and went forward, "nor has he
                        been to-day."</p>
                    <p>For a moment she stood hesitating, as if undecided what to do, while I,
                        knowing that Bell-ray never went forth now unless accompanied by some one
                        from his household, began to feel deep concern.</p>
                    <p>"John, what can it mean?" asked his sister, plainly showing increased
                        distress. "I came home from the Wests' a little while ago, and found Roger
                        gone. Aunt had seen him walking toward the road with another man just before
                        dark, but thought nothing of that, as he often goes that far, and, besides,
                        she thought the man <pb id="VAA3892-330" n="316"/> might be Sutton. A few
                        minutes later she saw him clambering into some sort of a conveyance, which
                        then drove rapidly away. He went off with no one from our place, we learned,
                        and as he seldom wants to go anywhere but here, I thought--oh, I don't know
                        what to think. Where do you imagine he can have gone? Think for me, John. He
                        is no more fit to be abroad than a child."</p>
                    <p>I was in as much doubt as she, and was about to tell her so, and yet beg her
                        not to feel any alarm, when, through the silence that had ensued, came the
                        booming of the anvils.</p>
                    <p>"Can he be <hi rend="i">there?</hi>" she said, suddenly. "I can think of no
                        other place. But if he is somebody took him, and he will not understand it
                        at all. I will go there." With this, she started off.</p>
                    <p>"Wait," I exclaimed; "who is out there in the carriage?"</p>
                    <p>"The young refugee, Sam Hollen."</p>
                    <p>"I will go with you," I said.</p>
                    <p>"You must not do anything of the kind," she returned firmly. "You are not
                        strong yet, and those people are not your friends. They are rejoicing over
                        the downfall of your General."</p>
                    <p>"Nevertheless if you go, so shall I. No harm will befall me."</p>
                    <p>Without further ado, I took my hat from the chair on which I had flung it and
                        walked down the path, giving no further heed to her continued <pb
                            id="VAA3892-331" n="317"/> and almost vehement remonstrances. Once
                        through the gate, she ran forward and sprang into the vehicle.</p>
                    <p>"Quick, Sam; drive on," she cried.</p>
                    <p>But the refugee, not understanding her purpose to outwit me, and being
                        deliberate at best in his mental processes, delayed long enough for me to
                        reach and enter the carriage. Then he started down the lane, having
                        previously turned about. Kate had not yet yielded, however, for as we neared
                        the road she leaned forward and spoke to the boy.</p>
                    <p>"Drive home; you can then return with Captain Trenham," she said, in despair
                        over my obstinacy, and still bent on having her way.</p>
                    <p>"Miss Bellray has forgotten," I put in, affecting a laugh, which, however, I
                        did with an effort. "We go first to the celebration for Mr. Bellray and then
                        home."</p>
                    <p>The boy looked over his shoulder at his mistress. She said nothing, and
                        taking her silence for acquiescence in my amendment he turned the horses'
                        heads in that direction. In the road he whipped up smartly and we made very
                        good speed. A quarter of an hour brought us within plain view of the
                        illumination. People were moving about in the glare, men and women, and
                        darting in and out among them were the smaller forms of children. Less
                        frequently came the explosions <pb id="VAA3892-332" n="318"/> of powder and
                        when we had drawn nearer they ceased altogether.</p>
                    <p>The people seemed to be crowding toward one side of the road, save the
                        children who still played about the flaming heap which was not allowed to
                        die out for the want of feeding. The rude platform from which the orators
                        were accustomed to address their listeners in fair weather was surrounded by
                        a hundred or more persons when we came upon the scene and stopped a little
                        way off. A man whom I did not recognize was speaking from the platform, upon
                        which were seated several other men. An exclamation of surprise from my
                        companion drew my eyes to her face, which was pale and quivering with
                        anger.</p>
                    <p>"Look!" said she; "there is Roger--on the platform. They have brought him
                        here to ridicule him."</p>
                    <p>Before I could even attempt to restrain her she had jumped from the vehicle
                        and was pushing her way through the crowd. I then heard Roger's name
                        pronounced by the speaker, who retired and Roger moved slowly toward the
                        front of the platform, where he stood silent for a moment. I got out and
                        walked nearer, smothering with indignation at the cruel joke, for it could
                        be nothing else, of which the poor man was being made a butt. Kate was lost
                        in the crowd somewhere, no doubt fighting her way to the platform, and I,
                        powerless to help her, stood in my <pb id="VAA3892-333" n="319"/> place
                        mortified beyond anything that ever happened to me.</p>
                    <p>"My friends," it was Bellray's voice, "I am told that you are ratifying your
                        great victory. I don't know just why I should be here, as I voted for Mr.
                        Douglas, but if Mr. Lincoln can prevent the coming of war, I shall be
                        satisfied." Here some of the men laughed, the one who had introduced him the
                        loudest of all; but the speaker went on: "Just now, however, I am one of the
                        defeated." More laughter came from a few, mingled with groans, and shouts of
                        "copperhead" and "butternut," but of these words he did not seem to know the
                        significance, and continued: "We fought you as hard as we could--"</p>
                    <p>At this point there came a great uproar from the crowd, with cries of "hang
                        the traitor and be done with him." Just at that moment Kate climbed upon the
                        platform and stood beside her brother, her face as white as the dead.
                        Bellray, amazed at the strange reception accorded him, and flushing with
                        anger, did not see her until she laid her hand on his arm. At the unwonted
                        spectacle the people had become still, and to their credit I will say that I
                        believe the jest was the; work of a few who, in this monstrous fashion,
                        sought to humiliate their old enemy. Flashing a look of scorn and defiance
                        at those below her, she turned to her brother and said, gently:</p>
                    <p>"Come, Roger; we will go home."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-334" n="320"/>
                    <p>"Not until I have told these ruffians what I think of them," he shouted
                        hoarsely. "They called me a traitor--didn't you hear?--called your brother a
                        traitor and want to hang him."</p>
                    <p>A voice was saying something in my ear, but so strongly did what was before
                        my eyes hold my attention that I did not realize it until I felt my shoulder
                        gripped warningly. Looking around I saw that it was Griswold.</p>
                    <p>"Listen, man; go back to your conveyance. I will get Bellray there in a
                        moment. You were crazy to have come, and wouldn't be here, I suppose, if it
                        were not for the fools who brought him. There are wild fellows here. Go;
                        don't make it too hard for me."</p>
                    <p>I was unarmed, but had it been otherwise, I was at least sensible enough to
                        know that Griswold's advice was good. Turning my eyes again upon the
                        platform I saw that it was deserted, and the crowd surging this way and
                        that, the women prudently flying to the outskirts and then across the road,
                        calling their children as they went or dragging them along if they could get
                        them in hand.</p>
                    <p>Lowering looks were already being thrown toward me as I moved slowly in the
                        direction of the carriage, and I heard the words "rebel" and "raider"
                        muttered in tones anything but pleasant or reassuring. Many men carried
                        revolvers in their hands as if expecting an outbreak, and the <pb
                            id="VAA3892-335" n="321"/> weapons glistened ominously in the firelight.
                        Some of the fellows eyed each other suspiciously. In one group I saw Wysart
                        talking to the man who had signaled to Vawter in the cave. Truly they were
                        not all of one mind, or, if so, they were not well enough acquainted to
                        know.</p>
                    <p>That one untoward act would precipitate violence was beyond doubt. This act
                        cool heads were at work to prevent and none more strenuously or discreetly
                        than Griswold, who was picking his way through the crowd with Roger, Kate
                        following closely. Griswold was laughing and calling out jestingly to one
                        and another. His assumed good humor and nonchalance seemed to have a
                        mollifying effect, for some covertly slipped their weapons into their
                        pockets. Behind him, however, jostled a large number of men with still
                        scowling visages.</p>
                    <p>I stood by the carriage until they came up and then, waiting until Roger and
                        his sister had entered, I climbed into the seat with the refugee driver, who
                        was entirely collected and imperturbable.</p>
                    <p>"Good-night, Bellray, and all of you," said Griswold, cheerily, "and now, my
                        lad, away you go."</p>
                    <p>As we swung round into the road two or three men ran out and caught the
                        horses, bringing them suddenly upon their haunches. The boy <pb
                            id="VAA3892-336" n="322"/> seemed to arouse suddenly and lifted his
                        whip, and at the same moment several other men rushed snarling up to the
                        side of the carriage. Before I knew what they were about I was pulled
                        violently from my seat just as the whip descended upon the frightened
                        horses, which, finding their heads now free, and the way clear before them,
                        sprang snorting forward.</p>
                    <p>Still feeble and crippled from my former injuries, I could make but a sorry
                        defense against the assault. But the little that I could do I did. Wrenching
                        my sound arm free, I seized one of my assailants by his hairy throat, and
                        gave it such a squeeze that he pulled and tore at my wrist while gurgling
                        with fear and suffocation.</p>
                    <p>In my fury I held on, knowing that I was being struck at from all sides, and
                        conscious that some wretch was crying wildly for the others to give him a
                        chance to shoot me. The powerful form of Griswold was forcing itself toward
                        me, as I could see by the swaying of the jammed mass of men in front, and he
                        presently got to my side. Shouldering my would-be executioners out of his
                        way as if they had been so many sacks of straw, he raised his two hands; one
                        he held out warningly, and in the other was a large revolver.</p>
                    <p>"I will kill the man who strikes the next blow," he said, in a voice as hard
                        as flint. "Captain, let go of that man."</p>
                    <p>Unconsciously I had retained my desperate <pb id="VAA3892-337" n="323"/>
                        clutch upon the fellow's neck and he was purple in the face from the effects
                        of the strangling. I released him at once, being myself half blind from the
                        blood that was running from a wound in my scalp. Evidently no one was
                        prepared to defy the stern man who held his weapon so steadily, for, as if
                        by common consent, they crowded backward, leaving a cleared space about us.
                        All save the one that I had held, and he merely stood stroking his throat
                        and gasping. Then for the first time I recognized in this man the one who
                        had persuaded Roger to speak.</p>
                    <p>"Serves you just right, Durring; if anything, you don't get what you
                        deserve," said Griswold, rebukingly. "If you hadn't been idiot enough to
                        bring Bellray here Trenham wouldn't have come. He came with Miss Bellray to
                        take her brother away and not in foolish defiance of you fellows. And
                        listen, all of you; he is going home without another scratch, and myself and
                            <hi rend="i">my men</hi>--do you understand?--are going to see that he
                        is let alone as long as he behaves himself. It shan't be said that any
                        decent man need fear to live in Harrison county--not if Dave Griswold can
                        prevent it. Now clear out, you there in the road; we are going that
                        way."</p>
                    <p>Thoroughly cowed by this forceful man, whom it was clear they all knew and
                        either respected or feared--possibly both--they made room for us to pass. A
                        hundred yards down the road the Bellray <pb id="VAA3892-338" n="324"/>
                        carriage had been stopped. As we approached, Kate, who was already upon the
                        ground in a frenzy of apprehension and anger, ran forward to meet us, with
                        exclamations of delight and relief at my safety, but not forgetting in the
                        least to thank my companion for his part in the night's dangers. Roger
                        leaned weakly out of the vehicle.</p>
                    <p>"It's all most extraordinary, Griswold; I don't understand it," he said. "To
                        treat me like that when I attended their meeting to ratify Mr. Lincoln's
                        election merely through courtesy. You and I have never agreed, Dave, but you
                        at least have always been a gentleman."</p>
                    <p>"That's all right, Roger; I'll fix these fellows. Just leave them to me,"
                        Griswold responded as he turned and walked rapidly back in the direction of
                        the now diminishing light of the great bonfire.</p>
                    <p>Mounting to my place with the boy we rolled away, going in silence for some
                        minutes save for occasional feeble growls from Bellray, who seemed able to
                        understand that he had been treated with great disrespect and fretted under
                        it. When we had covered a mile in this manner I felt a touch on my shoulder
                        from behind. Looking back I saw Kate bending toward me.</p>
                    <p>"You see now that I was right, sir," she said, softly. "Right or wrong, I am
                        glad I went," I <pb id="VAA3892-339" n="325"/> answered. "And as good luck
                        would have it, I throttled the rascal who was the cause of our going."</p>
                    <p>"Then I forgive you."</p>
                    <p>She spoke these four words so decisively as to leave no room for doubting the
                        depth of her resentment against those who had perpetrated the outrage. Any
                        personal humiliation that she might feel on account of the occurrence she
                        could overlook. But the indignity put upon her brother, through whose
                        clouded mind pride still struggled for expression, was an affront too deadly
                        to be easily forgotten. And in very truth it was many a long day before she
                        did forget.</p>

                        first public appearance, had undertaken to visit punishment upon me, I
                        concluded that Griswold was able to keep his word. At least I saw no further
                        signs of violence, though there were mutterings from the more radical ones.
                        For many days after the affair at the cross-roads I was compelled to keep to
                        my bed, for what with the excitement and the rough handling my wounds
                        suffered an aggravation that well-nigh proved serious. On this account and
                        for reasons of prudence, it was some weeks before I ventured to exercise
                        that freedom of movement which should never be denied to a peaceable man.
                        And such I now was, God knows, whether I would or not, and such, it seemed,
                        I was likely to continue so far as military operations were concerned.</p>
                    <p>I would probably have remained in this unsatisfactory state for a much longer
                        period had it not been for an event that befell me on the Corydon road and
                        turned my thoughts elsewhere. The time was evening. The sun had already
                        dropped <pb id="VAA3892-341" n="327"/> so low that the September dusk was
                        beginning to settle over the earth. We were driving from the town--Kate
                        Bellray and I--which I had that day seen for the first time since my return,
                        and whither we had gone upon some errand of hers. Upon nearing the entrance
                        to my mother's place the gaunt figure of a man, in tattered civilian
                        clothes, arose from the ground at the margin of the highway. Walking into
                        the middle of the road ahead of us, he stopped and stood awaiting our
                        approach. He did not move either to the right or left, even when we were
                        almost upon him, but seemed determined to bar our way. A slouch hat was
                        pulled far down over his forehead, and beneath its limp brim, in a tangle of
                        unkempt hair and whiskers, lurked two steady eyes.</p>
                    <p>Having no wish to run him down, though being far from satisfied as to his
                        purpose, I reined up quickly, and sharply commanded him to get out of the
                        way. Instead of doing so he raised his hand deprecatingly, and stepping a
                        little out on the side on which I was riding looked me keenly in the face.
                        There was a quick change in the glow of his eyes, but what it betokened was
                        not at once apparent. It struck me that somewhere I had seen the man before,
                        but in the business in which I had been engaged I had seen many faces. And
                        some of them, though appearing momentarily amid the clash of arms, are in my
                        memory yet, and more than one with the hot <pb id="VAA3892-342" n="328"/>
                        blood streaming down. Had this man been friend or foe? Or was he merely a
                        wayside vagrant bold enough to attempt a robbery?</p>
                    <p>"Move aside," I repeated impatiently, as he had not yet cleared the road. "Or
                        if there is anything you want, speak out." I added the latter words more
                        softly, for it occurred to me that the man looked in need, and all my anger
                        vanished when I observed that one ragged sleeve hung empty and flapping by
                        his side.</p>
                    <p>"Beg pardon, Captain, but I wanted to make sure it was you," he said, in
                        tones hollow and weak, as he came toward me. "A little while ago I asked a
                        feller goin' by if he know'd of any-body named Trenham livin' about here,
                        and he told me to go to hell, as if you was there or ought to be, and I felt
                        a little cheered up. You don't look like you'd had a' easy time yourself and
                        the boys must be mistakened."</p>
                    <p>"What boys, and how mistaken?" I asked in amazement, tempered, however, by a
                        dawning suspicion of a part of the truth.</p>
                    <p>"W'y, your boys--once know'd as Burkley's. A feller told us the day we
                        crossed--" he paused as at a disagreeable recollection, and drew his
                        begrimed hand over his eyes--" that your folks lived round here som'ers and
                        not in Virginny at all. And when you didn't show up next day, some of them
                        new fellers--"</p>
                    <p>He stopped in confusion, now looking at Kate <pb id="VAA3892-343" n="329"/>
                        for the first time and instantly taking off his hat, as though feeling that
                        he had been guilty of grave disrespect in keeping it on so long. When he did
                        this, I recognized the unruly corporal who had captured poor Venault.</p>
                    <p>"Neffitt!" I exclaimed, reaching out to take his hand, and glad to see this
                        rapscallion, who, with his many faults, had been one of the bravest of my
                        men.</p>
                    <p>Greatly to my surprise he drew back, rolling his excuse for a hat awkwardly
                        around his long forefinger.</p>
                    <p>"Corporal," said I, "what is the matter? Why will you not take my hand?"</p>
                    <p>"I'm a fool to let it stick in my craw, but it ain't fair to take no man's
                        hand, meanin' to say a thing like I'm goin' to say. But I can't tell you
                        about it in front of the lady--it ain't in my heart to hurt you mor'n I can
                        help. And when I've told you, instead of offerin' to shake hands, you'll set
                        the dogs on me."</p>
                    <p>"In heaven's name, man, what is all this about? Can't you see that what you
                        have already said, if unexplained, is worse than anything you have in your
                        mind to tell me?"</p>
                    <p>"I guess you're right," he said after a little hesitation. "The boys
                        thought--some of them new recruits, mind--when they heard that, that mebbe
                        you'd--" here he took a step backward, <pb id="VAA3892-344" n="330"/>
                        watching me closely the while--"that mebbe you'd bolted to the Yanks."</p>
                    <p>This was so much worse than anything I had expected to hear, a suspicion so
                        foul and besmirching and so wounding to the honor of a soldier, that I,
                        hardly able to believe my ears, could only sit and stare vacantly at Neffitt
                        as if numbed by a sudden paralysis. When I turned from him at last and
                        looked at Kate I beheld her gazing at the corporal with flaming cheeks and
                        dilated eyes, before which the poor fellow seemed to shrink and shrivel
                        pitifully.</p>
                    <p>"Shame upon you!" she cried indignantly. "'Twan't me, miss," he said hastily.
                        "I never really believed it myself. And as I couldn't soldier no more"--he
                        flirted his sleeve with the stump of his lost arm by way of emphasis-- "and
                        don't want to nohow since the General's took, I thought if I'd good luck in
                        findin' him I'd tell the Captain how it was and get his word for it that
                        'twan't so. And I hope, Captain, that you won't be too hard on them new
                        men--for most of 'em has been killed--and that feller who said your family
                        lived here said next day that he'd saw you with the Unionists."</p>
                    <p>"Neffitt, that man was a scoundrel and a spy, and this is merely a piece of
                        his villainy," I said. "But nevertheless it is not the sort of thing one
                        likes to hear."</p>
                    <p>I bade him sit down at the mouth of the lane <pb id="VAA3892-345" n="331"/>
                        and wait for me. When I had driven Kate home and returned to the place where
                        I had told him to remain, he was sitting on a mounting block in the
                        gathering darkness in an attitude of great dejection and weariness. He got
                        up and I took him into the vacant seat beside me. Little was said until we
                        reached the house, and then I observed how greatly changed the poor fellow
                        was. The old dare-devil, irreverent spirit appeared to have been crushed out
                        of him, at least for the time. It had gone with his arm, the loss of which,
                        I noticed afterward, filled him with deep humiliation, to which the calamity
                        that had befallen his General added a keener sting.</p>
                    <p>After he had eaten and rested he was some what more cheerful, but save in a
                        general way I held no conversation with him that night. I was not then in a
                        humor to deal patiently with the bearer of such a tale as he had told.
                        Neffitt had often come under my observation, and while rude and reckless,
                        his blunt nature made him at times even offensively truthful. Therefore I
                        did not doubt the story in the least, but was humiliated to think that such
                        an inference, so sullying to my honor, should be drawn and believed against
                        me.</p>
                    <p>Vawter! He was the man who had crossed the river with us, and he it was who
                        had seen me with the Unionists, a prisoner, it is true, but of that he had
                        not told them in his devilish purpose to repay me for the blow that I had
                        struck that <pb id="VAA3892-346" n="332"/> night at Bellray's. Had I known
                        of this on the occasion when he forced me to fight him in the cavern, I
                        believe I should certainly have put an end to his career.</p>
                    <p>It was the next day that I learned all that the corporal knew, not only as to
                        the story about myself--by which I was now resolved not to be troubled--but
                        as to my General and his men. He appeared clad in a suit of my own clothes,
                        and with a countenance remarkably improved by a razor and shears that black
                        Peter had wielded. He looked a little shame-faced and uneasy, as if carrying
                        a burden of which he wanted to be relieved.</p>
                    <p>"Captain," he said, attempting a salute with the hand that was not there, and
                        smiling ruefully at his mistake, "--I forget sometimes that it's gone--I
                        oughtn't to 'a' said it before her, though, bless her pretty face, I don't
                        know who she is or how much you'd care. 'Twan't right, nohow, and I wan't
                        bound to obey your orders <hi rend="i">then.</hi>"</p>
                    <p>"Never mind that, Neffitt; she knows how it is," I responded, seeing that he
                        was really distressed about the matter.</p>
                    <p>"Well, she's spunky, and stood up for you strong," he said, meditatively
                        stroking his bony chin, still red from the vigorous scraping administered by
                        Peter.</p>
                    <p>"And there's another thing I've never felt just right about it," he added,
                        looking at me curiously, <pb id="VAA3892-347" n="333"/> some of the old
                        mischievous sparkle in his sunken eyes.</p>
                    <p>"Out with it."</p>
                    <p>"I kicked you onc't," he confessed, repentantly.</p>
                    <p>I laughed. "So I have ever since suspected. But that is no great matter
                        either, now, only I hope nobody saw you."</p>
                    <p>"Nobody did; if they had I wouldn't 'a' done it." Then he continued in
                        explanation: "I alwus wanted to kick an officer; not that I had anything
                        agin 'em, but just for the satisfaction of knowin' I'd done it. They'd told
                        us and told us, time and agin, that any feller that struck his officer would
                        be took out and shot, and the more I thought about it the more I know'd I
                        just had to do it--only with me it was to kick and not strike. At last I got
                        where I must kick an officer or get out of the service, either by desertin
                        or bein' killed, and I didn't want either one of them things to happen.
                        Don't believe I could 'a' fought any more if it hadn't been for that chance
                        you give me. Afterwards I just turned to and seemed like two men."</p>
                    <p>The war-worn rascal stopped and laughed sepulchrally, as though the memory of
                        the kick he administered to me afforded him even yet a melancholy sort of
                        satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>"Beg pardon, Captain, but it did me a powerful sight of good. Over and over I
                        says to myself, <pb id="VAA3892-348" n="334"/> 'Neffitt, my boy, you're all
                        right; you've kicked an officer and settled the question of equality. Now
                        keep your eyes open to do that officer a favor.' And I've done it. You know
                        what happened that day when you and that foreign feller was a havin' it all
                        by yourselves. And before we'd got out of Indiany I knocked the daylights
                        out of two of the boys who said they thought you did it. That was just after
                        the General happened to speak to me one night and I ups and asks him if he'd
                        heard from you. He said he hadn't and know'd you must 'a' been took by them
                        there cornstalks. And I tells him what the feller said and that some of the
                        boys said mebbe it was so. Then you ought 'a' seen the General and heard
                        him. He took me by the collar like he was goin' to shut off my wind for
                        onc't and all.</p>
                    <p>" 'Do you believe it?' he says, fierce as a painter.</p>
                    <p>" 'No,' says I, 'but I'd like to know for sure.' " 'If I thought you did,'
                        says he, 'I'd twist your fool neck like a chicken's. If you ever get a
                        chance tell your captain that I said so.'"</p>
                    <p>How my heart rose at that and swelled with pride and gratitude at this added
                        proof of the confidence of my unfortunate chief.</p>
                    <p>"'Twa'n't much time we had to think about anything except savin' our skins,
                        after that. At Buffington I got shot, and was nabbed with a lot more and was
                        took up there to Indianapolis. <pb id="VAA3892-349" n="335"/> My arm wa'n't
                        doin' well so they put me in the hospital and cut it off, and that ended <hi
                            rend="i">me.</hi> I was sick and weak but purtended to be a powerful
                        sight wuss than I was, and I'm ashamed for deceivin' the good women who
                        nursed me as carefully as if I'd been a Unionist instead of a ripsnortin'
                        Confed, and never none too good at that. After awhile, one night, I give 'em
                        all the slip somehow, and got out of town. The fust feller I stumbled acrost
                        at daylight was out feedin' hogs. I was nearly dead, as I'd gone all night
                        like a house afire. He wanted to know where I was goin', and I told him just
                        for a little walk over to one of the neighbors.</p>
                    <p>" 'Your neighbors is down south,' he says, suddent like, 'and you're a
                        run-away rebel.'</p>
                    <p>"With that I 'most dropped in my tracks. But after lookin' at me a little bit
                        he says: 'You ain't any good to nobody but yourself and never can get in the
                        army agin, so what's the use?"</p>
                    <p>"And then he told me that our folks had a son of his in prison at
                        Andersonville, and he would do for me what he'd want anybody do for him if
                        he got out. So he slapped me in a haystack and brought me some victuals and
                        told me to keep quiet and go to sleep till he come back. He didn't come back
                        till nearly dark, then he had some more victuals. And he give me them old
                        clothes--only they was a little better then--and <pb id="VAA3892-350"
                            n="336"/> a little money, and told me to hustle as if the devil was
                        after me.</p>
                    <p>" 'If they ever get you in Camp Morton prison you won't get out till the
                        war's over unless it's on a board.'</p>
                    <p>" 'And that's what I don't want,' I says. " 'Then for God's sake, man, use
                        your "r's"--talk like a white man and not so much like a damned nigger or
                        yo'll get ketched up for a reb. Anybody can tell you're a Johnny.'</p>
                    <p>"That's all he know'd, of course, for it's the niggers that talks like
                        us--and anyway I'm only from Kentucky and ain't bad that way. That night on
                        the road and next day in the woods--just to obleege that feller, for I
                        didn't need do it at all --I said over and over every word I could think of
                        with an 'r' in it and tried it northern style, and have been doin' it ever
                        since until now I can 'most turn in for a Yank. But there's a pile of them
                        words! My tongue aches yet; I think it must be twisted a little."</p>
                    <p>He stopped and put his fingers in his mouth, feeling about in quest of proof
                        that he had not irretrievably damaged the vocal appendage, without the free
                        use of which he would have been a most unhappy man. Having satisfied himself
                        in this respect, I verily believe he would have talked all day had I not
                        thereafter confined him by questions to the subjects upon which I
                        particularly <pb id="VAA3892-351" n="337"/> desired to be informed. As to
                        what happened after the affair at Buffington, he knew nothing, of course,
                        save by common report, but before that it was ride, ride, ride, in general
                        very much as I have already told it. In matters of detail and personal
                        incident, he was able, from his experience, to illustrate the blinding,
                        benumbing hardships of the struggle in a manner beyond my power to
                        reproduce, even were it my desire to do so more fully than I have.</p>
                    <p>"And now," said Neffitt, determinedly, at the end, "since I've found you, and
                        settled the question that troubled them new fellers, and told you what the
                        General said, I'm goin' to start back."</p>
                    <p>"Back where?" I asked, uncertain as to his meaning.</p>
                    <p>"W'y, to help the General, where else? Mebbe 'twon't be no use, but leastways
                        I'll try. Can't tell what I can do till I get where the prison is."</p>
                    <p>"It is more than two hundred miles away," said I.</p>
                    <p>"I know that, but I'll get there. On my way down here I've been, practicin'
                        on bein' a one-armed Union soldier from old Kentuck-- there's many of 'em
                        down there, you know-- so's if I made slips with them r's and such
                        'twouldn't make no difference. I've got it all safe and sound up here," and
                        he tapped his head with his fingers.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-352" n="338"/>
                    <p>"We will go together," said I, with sudden resolution.</p>
                    <p>"Cuss that feller who told them things. Captain, just give me another chance
                        to take your hand."</p>
                    <p>His face beamed with joy, and he gripped the hand I held out to him as if
                        bent upon making amends for an unjust suspicion.</p>
                    <p>I was rapidly getting strong again in limb and body, and idleness had begun
                        to irk me. The old longing for action, which I could not gratify in the
                        direction that accorded most with my desires, turned my thoughts swiftly
                        toward my luckless chief, whom I would aid if possible. Left in prison he
                        would fret his soul out--this man of action and deeds. As well cage the
                        eagle and expect it to thrive and learn to like its captivity as to tame his
                        restless spirit within confining walls.</p>
                    <p>When once this design had entered my mind, I greatly wished that I possessed
                        Roger Bellray's old keenness in contriving. But after all, my services and
                        Neffitt's might not be needed; others might already have under way schemes
                        to the same end far more effective than any that I could conceive--being
                        slow witted in such things, as I have said. The opportunity for adventure,
                        however, and more than all else, the wish to aid the man who had so strongly
                        bound himself to me, aroused my sluggish faculties and presently I <pb
                            id="VAA3892-353" n="339"/> found myself burning with enthusiasm and
                        eager to be off to Ohio, while, much to my wonder, a dozen nebulous plans
                        began to jostle each other in my mind.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">A MESSAGE FROM THE GENERAL</head>
                    <p>N<hi rend="sc">OTWITHSTANDING</hi> our eagerness to start on our self-imposed
                        mission we were forced to endure delay, the chief cause of which was the
                        necessity for allowing Neffitt time to recover his strength more fully.
                        Rough and uneducated as he was, he possessed a readiness of wit and a
                        fertility of resource that I would greatly depend upon in any undertaking in
                        which I might engage. It was ten days or such a matter before I decided that
                        he was fit to depart, though he was anxious to do so much sooner than that.
                        Then, after providing him with money sufficient for his journey, I saw him
                        set out, for upon reflection I had determined that it was not best that we
                        should travel in company as I had at first suggested.</p>
                    <p>Two days later, having made excuses for my departure and indefinite absence,
                        I rode away again toward Jeffersonville. It was in the night, as that other
                        ride to the same town more than a year before had been, for now I had as
                        little desire to be spied upon as then. Arriving in the vicinity of the town
                        early in the morning, <pb id="VAA3892-355" n="341"/> I stabled my horse at
                        the house of a man I had met at Bellray's, and upon whom I knew I could
                        depend, leaving it to be recovered by Peter. The two or three miles yet
                        intervening I made on foot.</p>
                    <p>That night I reached Cincinnati, and the next night was in Columbus, without
                        other incident than such as falls to the lot of the ordinary traveler.
                        Seeking out quiet lodgings I slept soundly, making up in great measure for
                        the enforced wakefulness of the two previous days. Being a total stranger in
                        Columbus, and thus having no expectation of being recognized, I made no
                        pretense at disguise. The most that I had done in this respect was to
                        provide myself with apparel that might make me pass as a young tradesman or
                        a well-garbed mechanic.</p>
                    <p>When I had breakfasted the next morning I at once started out to fix the
                        location of the prison, which I knew to be somewhere upon the border of the
                        city. I had seen nothing of Neffitt, which fact disturbed me a little as he
                        had been told of my route and had promised, providing he met with no
                        misadventure, to keep a careful watch for my appearance. This I considered
                        necessary, seeing that we were both without knowledge of the town and might,
                        in the absence of such precaution, have some difficulty in meeting save
                        after exasperating delay.</p>
                    <p>I had gone but a block or two when, chancing <pb id="VAA3892-356" n="342"/>
                        to look across the street, I saw a maimed veteran in a well-worn Federal
                        uniform trudging along abreast of me, and now and again turning his eyes in
                        my direction as if keeping me in view. It was Neffitt. At the next corner he
                        made a motion indicating that I should follow him down the intersecting
                        street, which I did. He shambled on, I trailing behind, until the outskirts
                        of the city were reached and the grim stone prison which held our General
                        loomed up before us within its strong, high walls. As he now seemed to be
                        walking purposely slower I soon overhauled him, but not until he had turned
                        aside so as to put an obstruction between us and the lookouts on the yet
                        distant walls.</p>
                    <p>"Well?" said I, questioningly.</p>
                    <p>"I've made a start; I've hired that house out there for my family." He
                        pointed toward a little house some two hundred yards away to the right,
                        which seemed sadly in need of repairs.</p>
                    <p>"Your family?"</p>
                    <p>"It hain't come yet, and won't--for I hain't got none--but that's what I got
                        it for; leastways that's what I told the feller I hired it from. It's clost
                        to <hi rend="i">the place.</hi> I'm goin' to put in a stove and a bed and
                        then get acquainted with some of them guards, somehow."</p>
                    <p>It was plain that the corporal had been going ahead with his old-time
                        impulsiveness, and while I felt that he was probably the more capable of <pb
                            id="VAA3892-357" n="343"/> the two in the execution of some parts of the
                        business in hand, I feared that in his hurry to get on he might be
                        indiscreet. He evidently guessed what was in my mind, for he made haste to
                        assure me that he was acting with the utmost caution.</p>
                    <p>"We've got to know how they are in there, and what's goin' on," he added.
                        "Without that we can't move a finger to help 'em, and mebbe not then. I'm
                        bound to get inside, though, somehow. I know where you're stayin', and I
                        won't see you agin till I've got something to tell. Leave this part of it to
                        me, if you please."</p>
                    <p>He was so earnest, and spoke with such a thorough understanding of the
                        situation that I could do nothing less than accede to this arrangement.
                        Unless we could work in harmony with the imprisoned General we might as well
                        not work at all. So, agreeing to Neffitt's proposal and leaving him to his
                        own devices, I went back to the city.</p>
                    <p>Day after day passed until a week had gone by with no tidings from Neffitt.
                        At last, fearing that some misfortune had befallen him, and realizing that
                        without at least a pretense of an occupation suspicion might be attracted to
                        myself, at a venture I answered an advertisement for agents. It turned out
                        that the advertiser wanted solicitors to take subscriptions for a new war
                        history. I was on the point of declining this, to me, distasteful <pb
                            id="VAA3892-358" n="344"/> service, but before I had committed myself
                        there came a providential illumination.</p>
                    <p>Truly I was dull of wit and memory. For while my chief desire was to get word
                        with the General, I had not thought of a method by which he had once
                        received an important communication from within the Union lines that enabled
                        him to accomplish one of his most daring exploits. It came from a woman who,
                        notwithstanding her sex, was known to fame as Lieutenant Rawley, and who
                        did, in fact, bear a commission as an officer for some time in the command
                        of General Forrest. Shrewd, of keen intelligence and forceful character, she
                        was long a purveyor of information useful to the South. The intermediary in
                        the instance to which I refer was only a small, harmless book. At the time
                        it came into the General's hands I was acting temporarily as his adjutant.
                        After scrutinizing the volume for a few minutes, he passed it to me with the
                        look in his face that I always saw there when he contemplated one of the
                        bold strokes for which he was renowned.</p>
                    <p>"Well, sir," said he, "what do you make of that?"</p>
                    <p>"A nice little book," I answered turning the leaves; "but it will probably be
                        awhile before you get time to read it."</p>
                    <p>"Read it!" he cried, laughing; "I have read it within these five minutes, and
                        a very pretty <pb id="VAA3892-359" n="345"/> story it is, too. But let me
                        tell you that the name of the author of what I have read is not that on the
                        title page."</p>
                    <p>An hour later we were in the saddle and carrying a sharp wind in our teeth,
                        so great was our hurry. He had left the book in my possession and I placed
                        it in my pocket. Some days later, after we had accomplished the duty that
                        the secret intelligence had put before us, I returned it to him, having in
                        the meantime studied it with great care, and discovered nothing of the
                        "pretty story" of which the General had spoken. When, however, he gave me
                        the key to the mystery, it was a mystery no longer, but as simple a matter
                        as one would care to know. In very truth its simplicity was its safeguard,
                        for it hardly approached the dignity of a cipher.</p>
                    <p>And here now I had stumbled upon an opportunity that gave much promise. It at
                        least aroused a hope that I might bring about the very thing without which,
                        as Neffitt said, we could not move a finger to aid those within the
                        formidable walls upon which we were at the time gazing. I succeeded without
                        difficulty in engaging myself to the advertiser. Not knowing then how
                        closely the officials guarded their important prisoner from even the view of
                        outsiders, I thought that by prosecuting my new avocation skillfully I might
                        perhaps be allowed conversation with General Morgan himself. But I did not
                        intend <pb id="VAA3892-360" n="346"/> to show myself at the prison until I
                        had established a sort of footing in the business by securing a respectable
                        list of subscribers in the city.</p>
                    <p>For two days I invaded offices, shops and public buildings, and tramped up
                        and down the streets and avenues from house to house with a veritable fire
                        of energy, achieving a success beyond anything that I would have believed
                        possible. I had even obtained the name of the governor of Ohio himself--that
                        man who had done so much to aid in the ruin that had come upon my comrades.
                        Under other circumstances it would not have been possible to do these
                        things; but in pursuance of my purpose then I would allow nothing to stand
                        in my way, submitting to rebuffs, and even to insults for which it would
                        have been a pleasure to administer heavy chastisement, but at last emerging
                        triumphantly with the signatures of the offenders.</p>
                    <p>On the night of the second day I sat in my room, tired but gloating as over a
                        battle won. The next day, fortified with the evidence of previous industry,
                        I would boldly invade the prison and with lip and tongue fight my way to the
                        General. I had come to understand, as never before, that the man who swings
                        a sword is not more a hero after he has overthrown his enemy than many who
                        engage in the conflicts of peace. Presently I became aware that some one had
                        stopped at my door. Not waiting for a knock to be <pb id="VAA3892-361"
                            n="347"/> sounded I went forward and opened it. My late corporal stepped
                        quickly within. Closing the door I turned toward him, delight and anger
                        warring for expression, for the failure to hear from him had greatly
                        provoked me.</p>
                    <p>"Well, sir, you have given me a pretty wait," said I. "I had almost concluded
                        that you had been caught and hung."</p>
                    <p>"Very far from it," he answered, pulling a chair into the center of the room,
                        seating himself upon it and by a gesture indicating that I should do
                        likewise with another. "Now," he continued, "I've not seen the General, and
                        didn't get to talk to him. It took me till to-day to find out that I
                        couldn't. They're all-fired skeery of him and them officers of his'n that
                        are with him. Won't even let 'em look out of a winder."</p>
                    <p>The corporal was greatly cast down, but not discouraged by his partial
                        failure. It was gradually disclosed that he had learned some things that
                        might be of benefit to us in the making of further effort. The General and
                        his fellow-officers were confined in the wing of the prison called the East
                        Hall, and occupied cells in that side of it facing the town. During the day
                        they were allowed to exercise in the corridor upon which their cells opened.
                        Surrounding the buildings was a thick wall, twenty-five feet high, upon
                        which at intervals were the small shelter houses for the outside guards,
                        who, armed with guns, <pb id="VAA3892-362" n="348"/> were expected to
                        prevent the scaling of the walls at all hours.</p>
                    <p>Some of these guards, when off duty, frequented a public house not far
                        removed from the prison. Of this house Neffitt had become a regular patron,
                        carefully studying the habits of the men. In respect to any over-indulgence
                        in drink, he confessed sadly that, with two exceptions, they were above
                        reproach. With these two he was taking pains to become especially friendly,
                        but with what particular object in view he did not say and I did not
                        inquire. Indeed, as he afterward admitted, this course was taken at a
                        venture, in the absence of definite information from within the walls as to
                        what would be expected of us.</p>
                    <p>As things befell, I am forced to concede that without this foresight an event
                        that set the country by the ears might have had a very different
                        termination. When the corporal left it was with a promise to report to me on
                        the following night, for I told him I might have something to say to him,
                        though not then confiding to him the nature of my purposes.</p>
                    <p>It might be that I should fail even more ingloriously than Neffitt in my
                        intended attempt to get speech with the General. This did not now trouble me
                        so much since there remained the other method of communication upon which I
                        set great store. Taking up the volume that I had <pb id="VAA3892-363"
                            n="349"/> been using in my business of the past two days I went to work
                        to prepare my message. The book contained a table of contents showing more
                        than thirty chapters, designated by numeral letters. Choosing the nineteenth
                        chapter, I made a small dot with my pencil a little below and midway between
                        the last two numerals, thus indicating that the ninth chapter had been
                        selected as the one in which the message could be found. Turning then to the
                        figure 2, marking the second page of the book, I put a short dash above it,
                        indicating that the second and each succeeding alternate line, counting from
                        the top of the page, might be looked to as furnishing the letters and words
                        composing the message. A dot beneath, and another some spaces to the left of
                        the figure completed its ornamentation. These designated the second letter
                        preceding the one having the mark <hi rend="i">beneath</hi> it as the letter
                        to which attention was to be given in spelling out the words. A short dash
                        to the right of the figure 3, marking the third page, indicated that the
                        message would begin on the third page of the chosen chapter, and a circular
                        mark resembling a small letter "o" beneath the figure 3, allowed the use of
                        the third preceding word entire. Let it be understood that the location of
                        these little marks, all of which were made lightly, meant a great deal, and
                        that I might have arrived at the same result by putting them in very
                        different places.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-364" n="350"/>
                    <p>Being done with this, I found the ninth chapter and on its third page began
                        to make faint but discernible marks below the proper letters and words in
                        the designated lines. I had previously fixed in my mind the communication
                        that I desired to make, and having marked the last letter, I then, in like
                        manner, appended my own name. Then I read it all over to see that I had made
                        no mistakes. To me it was perfectly legible, and there was no doubt that it
                        would be as clear to the General, if it should ever get to him. "<hi
                            rend="i">Two friends outside--what can we do?"</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>In the selection and arrangement of these simple words I had given my brain a
                        serious cudgeling. It was necessary that the message should be short in
                        order to be quickly read, that it should be composed of letters most
                        frequently used, so that it would run freely, and that it should acquaint
                        the receiver with our presence without compromising him with our outside
                        efforts if any unfriendly eye should see and decipher the meaning of my
                        marks. A discovery of my purpose would not only take me out of the game, but
                        would probably be fatal to any plan of escape that the General might have in
                        contemplation or already on foot.</p>
                    <p>I was not versed in cryptography--to which, indeed, as I have said, this
                        simple system bore little resemblance--and hence was sadly lacking in
                        confidence in my poor penciling. But as I <pb id="VAA3892-365" n="351"/>
                        only intended to use it--if I could--in the event that my attempt to reach
                        my chief personally failed, I determined that I could do nothing less than
                        take such risk as there was. Another matter that troubled me greatly was the
                        fear that, even if my book should reach him, he would have no opportunity to
                        prepare a return message. If, as was most reasonable to believe, his
                        inspection of the volume should be under the eyes of an official, he would
                        not dare put pencil, if he should possess one, to its pages. And yet there
                        were few things that he would not dare where a point was to be gained. But
                        as to all this I would see in proper time.</p>
                    <p>In the afternoon of the next day I set out for the prison and succeeded in
                        being admitted to the presence of the warden. It was with much difficulty
                        that I could get him to give me a hearing for my work. He would certainly
                        have turned me out with little ceremony had not his attention been
                        opportunely called to the signature of the dignitary under whose appointment
                        he held his office. For, be it understood, the prison in his charge was a
                        state and not a national institution, and in it were held hundreds of
                        malefactors who had been convicted in courts of justice of all sorts of
                        crimes against the laws.</p>
                    <p>Though my General and his officers were confined in a wing of the prison
                        separated from the parts occupied by the convicts, I felt then and always
                            <pb id="VAA3892-366" n="352"/> ways have felt since, that the fact of
                        their incarceration there at all was a needless and unworthy humiliation of
                        proud men, whose valorous deeds entitled them to better treatment from their
                        foes. Not, however, until I stood within the portals that had been so often
                        opened and shut to allow the incoming and the outgoing of thieves, murderers
                        and the like, did I feel in full measure the keenness of the shame that had
                        been put upon them. How much I should have liked then to pour out upon the
                        head of the blameless warden the indignation that rose to my throat, God
                        only knows. But instead of doing that I was forced to smother my real
                        feelings and assume an entirely different state of mind and heart.</p>
                    <p>In deference to the signature of the governor the warden listened to what I
                        had to say, but at the end curtly refused to add his own name to my list and
                        presently turned me over to the mercies of one of the sub-wardens, a
                        kindly-disposed elderly man, who speedily succumbed to my arguments. And
                        then, after using all the powers of ingratiation that I could bring to my
                        aid, I asked to be allowed to show my work to the rebel officers, who must
                        be, I asserted, peculiarly interested. That I was told could not be
                        permitted, and the manner of the refusal left no doubt of its finality.</p>
                    <p>Fearing the effect of persistence in my desire to see the General personally,
                        I begged the subwarden <pb id="VAA3892-367" n="353"/> to take the book up,
                        together with my list and submit it to the General, explaining that I should
                        like to obtain the autograph of so famous a rebel. After a brief
                        consultation with the warden, followed by a close inspection of the list and
                        a careful shaking and leafing of the book to see that no message or other
                        objectionable thing was concealed in either, the sub-warden made off. He was
                        gone a long time and I was encouraged to believe that my ruse might be
                        successful. Nearly an hour passed before he returned.</p>
                    <p>"The General says he will take one if he is still here when you deliver them,
                        but that he won't sign your list," said the sub-warden. "He says he hopes to
                        be exchanged soon--which he won't be, of course--and that your book anyway,
                        as far as he can see, is only a one-sided affair, giving the North more than
                        its due and lying about the South. He'd really like to have it, though, as a
                        curiosity, he says. He and Colonel Duke looked it over quite awhile."</p>
                    <p>"The impudent rebel," cried I, affecting to be extremely indignant, but
                        really vastly pleased to know that my leader's spirit was in no wise curbed
                        by his misfortunes. "But I'm resolved that he shall have it, and I ask that
                        when I bring it you give me permission to force it down his traitorous
                        throat."</p>
                    <p>At this brave speech the sub-warden looked at <pb id="VAA3892-368" n="354"/>
                        me pityingly--or was it contemptuously? Whichever it was, I felt that it was
                        born of respect for my chief, and by that was comforted. But he was not
                        content with turning me off with a look.</p>
                    <p>"And Colonel Duke said that, if I pleased, I might tell the dapper little
                        book-peddler -- he missed it there in your size, and it's a shame you
                        haven't got grit enough to be a soldier--that if the warden is willing, he
                        requests the pleasure of having you kicked out, with his compliments." The
                        sub-warden laughed, as if this were a pleasant bit of humor.</p>
                    <p>"The devil he did," said I. "Suppose you bring him down here and let him do
                        it himself."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, don't take it so much to heart," the official hastened to say,
                        relentingly. "He saw something in the book about the Vicksburg surrender
                        that made him angry, something about Pemberton napping within the city while
                        Grant was running tunnels from the outside to blow up his fortifications.
                        The Colonel said he knew Pemberton was the kind of man who would do
                        everything he could do from the inside to save himself, even if he did
                        finally march out on a national holiday. But he did say, as a matter of
                        fact, that if it had not been for the breach made in the fortifications by
                        Grant's mines, Vicksburg would not have changed commanders so soon."</p>
                    <p>I do not know how much more the loquacious sub-warden would have said had not
                        a growl from <pb id="VAA3892-369" n="355"/> his chief shut him up abruptly.
                        As it was, it occurred to me that during his absence he had been furnished
                        with a verbal entertainment that was very likely not purposeless, and that
                        the greater part of it had come from Colonel Duke was still more evident.
                        Taking myself off in an apparently bad humor which I made a visible effort
                        to conceal--beginning, by that time, to be a little vain of my
                        performance--I hastened into the city and went at once to my room to learn
                        if my message had borne fruit.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the table of contents I scrutinized the chapter headings, but saw
                        no marks save those that my own pencil had put there. With a heart sinking
                        with disappointment I was about to lay the volume aside when the thought
                        flashed into my mind that possibly the General had not chosen to alter the
                        cipher and that an answering communication might be found immediately
                        following my own. And so it proved.</p>
                    <p>On the page following that on which I had put my last mark the paper showed
                        signs of having been pricked by a pin. No casual eye would have noticed
                        these signs, perhaps, but to me they were as clear as my own, though, as it
                        seemed, made furtively if not in haste. In a little while I had spelled out
                        these words: <hi rend="i">"At work--danger on wall op. E. Hall--ready near
                            thanks day-- watch change commandants."</hi> That was all, but how much
                        it seemed to me then. As I read the <pb id="VAA3892-370" n="356"/> message
                        the prisoners had plans of their own under way in which I might be able to
                        bear a part. Ready near Thanksgiving day! I remembered that the Northern
                        President, weeks before, had issued a proclamation setting apart the last
                        Thursday in November as a day for national thanksgiving. It was clear that
                        some plan of the prisoners was expected to mature then. But what was this
                        about a change of commandants? What they feared was evidently a close
                        inspection of the prison, and discovery of their plot, such as would likely
                        follow the incoming of a new military commandant. A rumor that the present
                        officer would be superseded I had already heard, but until then it had made
                        no impression on me. In the light of it now I read the General's message,
                        and saw that Colonel Duke's words concerning the change of commanders at
                        Vicksburg, which the sub-warden had repeated to me--as the former, no doubt,
                        believed he would do--were not meaningless.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">FRIENDS ON THE WALL</head>
                    <p>C<hi rend="sc">OULD</hi> I have seen how my imprisoned fellow-officers were
                        toiling at that moment for the liberation of their beloved leader, and could
                        I have known how they had been toiling for weeks and would toil for weeks
                        yet to come, my concern would have been even greater than it was. For it was
                        a precarious undertaking, with many chances of discovery and failure as
                        against a mere pitiful hope. Its successful execution, in the face of the
                        disheartening obstacles that met them on every hand, would be little less
                        than the accomplishment of a miracle. But these men of the free air were
                        accustomed to obstacles and to overcoming them as well.</p>
                    <p>With no prospect of release from confinement in a regular way, they set about
                        to find some other. Tramping the narrow corridor by day or lying in their
                        pinching cells by night, they thought of many plans. It was the resolute
                        Hines who dispelled the chaos of doubt. One day, engaging in conversation
                        with old Hevay, a sub-warden of long service, he offered a casual remark as
                        to the <pb id="VAA3892-372" n="358"/> seeming architectural and sanitary
                        perfection of the prison, calling attention to the unusual dryness of the
                        floors of the ground cells, one of which he occupied. If Hevay had a hobby
                        it was that very thing, as Hines well knew. Straightway he told of the
                        existence of an air chamber extending the length of the bottom tier of
                        cells.</p>
                    <p>Carefully concealing his interest in this important revelation, Hines lost
                        little time in testing its accuracy. With knives secretly obtained from the
                        table on which their meals were served, he began to dig and pry in the hard
                        floor. Little by little he made progress, and finally, after incredible
                        labor and pains, penetrated eighteen inches of cement and brick to the space
                        beneath of which the sub-warden had spoken. The debris was surreptitiously
                        carried out in pocket handkerchiefs, and mingled with the ashes in the large
                        corridor stove or else concealed in his own bed and in the beds of his
                        fellows, who gave him such assistance as they could.</p>
                    <p>Once in the air chamber there was ample room for work. A tunnel was begun and
                        pushed through the three-foot stone wall of the cell house, then under the
                        corridor floor, then through the wall of the inclosing structure to the
                        prison yard, but not opened to the air until the time came for departure. It
                        was the work of weeks of the most wearing labor, weeks of patience, caution,
                        constant vigilance, of pouring sweat and <pb id="VAA3892-373" n="359"/>
                        pounding hearts. It was guarded by keen eyes and alert ears, and shared by
                        many eager hands--the hands of men desiring liberty for another more than
                        they desired it for themselves, and who would be content if that one should
                        escape and they remain. To the aid of the knives--of such little avail
                        against blocks of stone--was providentially brought a single other tool, a
                        broken spade skillfully procured, and the light of candles which they had
                        been permitted to buy and had carefully hoarded.</p>
                    <p>I did not know of these things until later. The battle for liberty was in
                        progress, but what form it was taking could only be conjectured. That it was
                        a stupendous conflict waged against solid stone, from a darksome hole in the
                        ground, with such sorry weapons of offense, I did not dream. Hence I say,
                        that had I known the truth my concern over the outcome of their struggles
                        would not have been lessened. As it was, time passed slowly enough.</p>
                    <p>From evening to evening Neffitt came to report his progress. He was still
                        working on the guards, he told me, and was getting on close terms with the
                        two who had an over-fondness for liquor, asserting that they might prove
                        useful. I think that the possible help he expected them to render was more
                        of a negative than a positive sort, as he did not hint that they were
                        lacking in either honesty or loyalty. But I did not then <pb
                            id="VAA3892-374" n="360"/> seek enlightenment, and really hoped that our
                        own ends might be achieved without involving any innocent person in trouble.
                        He expressed no surprise on learning that I had fared no better than himself
                        in my effort to speak with the General. The faithful rogue rather seemed to
                        be pleased than otherwise, not because I had failed but because he had not
                        been discredited. When, however, I proceeded to tell him of the message
                        received, his delight was sincere and unbounded.</p>
                    <p>"They must be workin' a tunnel," he said with conviction, "and hope to get
                        over that wall somehow. By all the smoky ghosts of hell I can help 'em
                        there."</p>
                    <p>Much impressed by the enthusiasm displayed in the utterance of this original
                        oath, I asked him in what manner he proposed to be of assistance.</p>
                    <p>"My two friends is on that wall. They lets down a string, I ties on a bottle
                        or two and they celebrates the day, that is if it's Thanksgivin'. But
                        they'll do it most any time for that matter, as I've already helped 'em that
                        way onc't. Hope it'll be a nasty bad night, though."</p>
                    <p>"Is there any place from which we could run a tunnel from the outside so as
                        to get under that wall?" I asked, having in my mind Colonel Duke's statement
                        to the sub-warden about the counter-mines of Grant and Pemberton at
                        Vicks-burg.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-375" n="361"/>
                    <p>"No, there ain't, and it's too risky. They comes over that wall and not
                        through it or under it. If you can reach the General agin, for God's sake
                        tell him to make it Thanksgivin'. It'll be easier to get them fellers to put
                        on lots of steam that night."</p>
                    <p>He left me a little later, taking an additional supply of money, having
                        confessed to me that he was down to his last copper. We were both elated
                        over the certainty that we were at last making definite headway. On the next
                        day and still the next I continued my canvassing desultorily from motives of
                        caution. After that I took no more orders--not being at all content with the
                        unheroic character of my employment--and from that time only awaited the
                        arrival of my books in order that I might have further excuse for visiting
                        the prison. For these I had to send to Philadelphia.</p>
                    <p>Three weeks passed, and a vexatious delay in the coming of the books filled
                        me with despair. The change in commandants was about to be accomplished, and
                        the day of national thanksgiving was only two days off, when, to my joy, a
                        heavy box was set down at my lodgings directed to John Clark, that being my
                        own name in truth, though not all of it.</p>
                    <p>Being now armed with the authority of my calling I lost no time in making my
                        way to the prison, carrying with me three or four of the books. In the one
                        intended for General Morgan <pb id="VAA3892-376" n="362"/> was a message
                        informing him of the threatened danger and telling him that on the night of
                        the ensuing holiday he need not fear the wall. This I did on the assurance
                        of Neffitt that he would not fail in the execution of his design. I had come
                        to rely greatly on the corporal's ability in his chosen field, and beyond
                        those latent doubts that always exist until a hazardous undertaking has been
                        accomplished, I felt no misgiving.</p>
                    <p>It was in the afternoon and the sky was overcast by gray, smudgy clouds,
                        through which filtered occasional flakes of snow that came hesitatingly down
                        as if loath to reach the earth. The air was chill enough to justify me in
                        turning up the collar of my overcoat and in taking strides that carried me
                        quickly to my destination. A guard at the gate let me in, after consulting a
                        higher official in pursuance of his duty. Only the sub-warden, with whom my
                        business had been conducted when there before, and a clerk, occupied the
                        office. The absence of the warden was a hopeful sign. When the sub-warden
                        had accepted and paid for his own volume, I reminded him of the promise of
                        General Morgan, made to himself, to take the book if not previously
                        exchanged, and asked if he were still a prisoner.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, he is here," said the official, "and here he is likely to stay. He is
                        too hard a man to catch to be turned loose in a hurry. Do you know that man
                        has cost the government millions <pb id="VAA3892-377" n="363"/> upon
                        millions of dollars? Well, it's a fact, and it's a good deal easier and
                        cheaper to feed him here than to have to run him down again."</p>
                    <p>"That's right," I assented. "Give him time to read a little of the recent
                        history of his country. It will do him good."</p>
                    <p>"He'd much rather be making it than reading it. But I haven't time to bother
                        with your book now. Leave it here and I will see about it. Come back
                        to-morrow."</p>
                    <p>"Well, there's one for that bloodthirsty colonel; maybe he will take it. If
                        they've got any money I might as well have some of it as anybody else."</p>
                    <p>The sub-warden threw the books on the desk at which sat the clerk, and
                        repeated the statement that I should return on the next day, which closed
                        the interview. Grievously disappointed at this additional delay, but not
                        daring to be too urgent I left the prison. I had not proceeded far on my
                        road until I overtook a man who had been walking leisurely ahead of me as if
                        he too had just left the prison, but if such was the case he had escaped my
                        observation. As I was in the act of passing him he spoke, and his voice made
                        me start with apprehension, for it was the voice of the spy, Vawter.</p>
                    <p>"So it is you that I find here, Captain Trenham," he said. "Now go a little
                        slower while I pick up a bit; walk behind me--they can see us <pb
                            id="VAA3892-378" n="364"/> yet from the walls if they look, and I don't
                        want them to know that I'm talking to you."</p>
                    <p>Saying this, he quickened his steps and went before me, while I, gathering my
                        wits, wondered what he was about.</p>
                    <p>"Give it up, Captain," he continued without looking around. "I don't want to
                        make trouble for you, but I am here in the interest of the government to
                        look for stray Morgan men. I relieved another agent only yesterday, and here
                        you stumble upon me--the last one of the lot that I hoped to see. You have
                        got something going, and if you don't give it up and leave this very night
                        it will be my business to find out what it is, much as I dislike to do
                        it."</p>
                    <p>He spoke deliberately, his head half turned that his words might the better
                        fall back to me over his shoulder. It was already beginning to grow dark
                        both from the hour and the thickening clouds, but darker still at this
                        moment were my thoughts. Not for an instant, however, did I harbor any
                        notion of abandoning my purpose. Presently, being out of view of the prison,
                        he stopped and turned around. I had not yet spoken.</p>
                    <p>"Well, what do you say? Shall we have peace or war? Strange as it seems to
                        me, I remember that I owe you something and am willing to do you a good
                        turn."</p>
                    <p>"I will talk it over with you," said I, at this, "but we can not do it here.
                        There's a place <pb id="VAA3892-379" n="365"/> a little way off where we can
                        come to terms. It's the house of a crippled friend, who is not likely to be
                        at home. Do you agree?"</p>
                    <p>He looked at me suspiciously. "How many more of your friends will be there?"
                        he asked.</p>
                    <p>"Not a soul."</p>
                    <p>He finally assented, though not without hesitation, and felt about his person
                        as if to make sure that his weapons were in place. As for myself I was
                        wholly unarmed. I went straight to the little house that Neffitt had hired
                        for his own use. It was dark and there was no external sign of occupancy,
                        nor was my knock on the door answered. Trying the door it yielded and I went
                        in, followed by Vawter. Striking a match, I found and lighted an oil lamp
                        that was standing on a table at the side of the room; upon the table also
                        was a loose coil of small cotton rope. Scattered about were two or three
                        wooden chairs. To satisfy my companion that, save for us, the house was
                        empty, I took up the lamp and together we went into the remaining rooms. In
                        one was a cheap bed; in the other a small stove; nothing more in either.
                        Returning then to the first room I set down the lamp. In the meantime my
                        mind had been working busily.</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Vawter," said I, "you mean well, no doubt, and I thank you, but I shall
                        stay."</p>
                    <p>He had seated himself in one of the chairs with one elbow resting on the
                        table, the hand of his <pb id="VAA3892-380" n="366"/> other arm--the right
                        one--in his overcoat pocket. At my words he moved uneasily and his face
                        hardened into the old, wicked sneer.</p>
                    <p>"Then I must take you," he returned sharply, "and I'll do it before any other
                        person comes. I think you mean to trap me and I'm a fool not to see it.
                        Don't resist or I'll kill you. I gave you a chance and we are quits."</p>
                    <p>With that he whipped a revolver out of his pocket and leveled it upon me, but
                        not less quick was I. Springing upon him I seized his wrist before he could
                        use the weapon, but he was active and strong, and then began a fierce
                        struggle for the mastery. My foot became entangled in the chair and I fell
                        to the floor, taking my antagonist with me. Making a desperate effort I
                        succeeded in pinning him down under the very edge of the table, the arm
                        holding the revolver outstretched and still in my grasp and the other held
                        close to his side by my knees. With my free hand I reached up for the rope
                        and got a coil of it under his head, then below his shoulders and drew it
                        tight. Once more, a little further down, and save for the weapon he was at
                        my mercy. Gradually working my fingers outward until they fell upon the
                        pistol I tore it from his hand and flung it to the far side of the room. A
                        minute more and he was helpless; then I bound him securely and propped him
                        against the wall. Up to this time not a word had been uttered by either of
                        us, nor did <pb id="VAA3892-381" n="367"/> either have much breath now; but
                        Vawter was the first to break the silence.</p>
                    <p>"You win again," he panted, "and do it fairly again, too. What are you going
                        to do with me?"</p>
                    <p>"Keep you close for a few days; nothing more if you give me your word not to
                        connect me with this business. For myself I do not care, but there are
                        others to be considered."</p>
                    <p>"Another, you mean, eh, Captain?"</p>
                    <p>"Have it that way if you please; what do you say?"</p>
                    <p>He looked at me a little while before replying, and seemed to be considering
                        my proposition. At last he spoke: "I agree, and will stick to it, though
                        five months ago I would have been drawn and quartered first. But I've got
                        over that."</p>
                    <p>At this point we were interrupted by the entrance of Neffitt, who looked
                        profoundly astonished at the unexpected scene. For a moment his eyes rested
                        upon Vawter, then he turned to me.</p>
                    <p>"That's the feller, Captain, that crossed with us at Brandenburg--the one
                        that said them things."</p>
                    <p>"Never mind that now, Neffitt," I cautioned. "It's all past and gone, and we
                        have other things to think of. Can you keep this man here a few days? He
                        must not be harmed--not in the least, you understand; just kept close and
                        secure."</p>
                    <p>Neffitt consented, reluctantly I thought, for he <pb id="VAA3892-382" n="368"
                        /> was the kind of man who cherished a favor or a grudge with equal
                        intensity, and here before him was one who had played a scoundrel's part, to
                        the injury and distress of many people. After satisfying myself that proper
                        arrangements had been made as to the disposition of our enforced guest, I
                        returned to my own lodgings.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE ESCAPE</head>
                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> next day when I called at the prison in obedience to
                        the sub-warden's command it was with some doubt as to whether I would be
                        suffered to depart, for I was not prepared to place entire dependence on
                        Vawter's word. But it was not long until I was reassured. The officials, so
                        the sub-warden told me, had hesitated about allowing the prisoners to have
                        my books, but on examining them had finally concluded that there was no good
                        reason for denying them the privilege if they chose to exercise it.</p>
                    <p>As a result only one of the books was returned to me, Colonel Duke angrily
                        refusing, upon renewed inspection, to have anything to do with the one
                        designed for him. This did not surprise me; on the other hand I should have
                        been greatly disconcerted if it had been retained, and even hastened away
                        for fear that at the last moment some other person about the place might
                        offer to take it.</p>
                    <p>Once more in my room and secure from observation, I turned again to the
                        chapter headings in the table of contents. There was no mark or <pb
                            id="VAA3892-384" n="370"/> sign until I came to Chapter XV, and here to
                        the right of the numeral V was a puncture made with the point of a pin.
                        Turning further I saw a similar puncture to the right of and another above
                        the figure I marking the first page of the book. On the next page, to the
                        right of the figure 2, was a short horizontal scratch. Above the figure 3 on
                        the following page was a like scratch. The message was therefore in the
                        fifth chapter, beginning on the third line of the second page, counting from
                        the top, and continuing on each succeeding third line until finished. The
                        letters composing the words of the communication, as shown by the position
                        of the marks at figure I, were those next following the ones <hi rend="i"
                            >above</hi> which the indicating mark would be found. With great
                        eagerness I spelled out the seven words constituting the message which told
                        me that on Thanksgiving night an effort for freedom would be made and urged
                        that attention be given to the wall.</p>
                    <p>The morrow was the day of prayer and feast. It dawned gray and dull and
                        threatening, and Neffitt's hope that the night might be a bad one was likely
                        to be fulfilled. His two convivial friends were still doing wall duty, and
                        he had, at their solicitation, he said, grudgingly promised to put it in
                        their way to show an appreciative observance of the occasion.</p>
                    <p>To me that short day was seemingly the longest on the calendar, but darkness
                        came at last and <pb id="VAA3892-385" n="371"/> with it a cold, steady rain
                        that drove everybody indoors except such as were compelled to brave the
                        weather. Near nine o'clock I set out for Neffitt's house and reached it to
                        find him absent and the door fastened. Getting under the shelter of the
                        sorry little porch built over the front door, I stood in the darkness and
                        waited. In a few minutes Neffitt came and admitted me. When a light was made
                        I saw that his not over-thick clothes were soaked and dripping, and that he
                        was wet to the skin. His face was blue and pinched with the chill air and
                        rain.</p>
                    <p>"A little of that will do you good," said I, pointing to a large bottle of
                        whisky on the table.</p>
                    <p>"I'd like it well enough," he responded, looking at the bottle longingly.
                        "But that's for them two friends of mine. They just h'isted one a bit ago.
                        And besides <hi rend="i">we</hi> wanter keep a clear head--it's their
                        noggins that's to get muddled; besides they paid for the whisky--likewise
                        for them things to eat in that basket. I swore I wouldn't spend another cent
                        for 'em--never can tell when a feller is goin' to get 'spicious. They gets
                        together at midnight and has a supper in honor of the day."</p>
                    <p>With a complete willingness that on this night they should eat and drink to
                        their heart's content, and recognizing Neffitt's good sense in refusing the
                        liquor, I looked about me for Vawter, and found him in the middle room lying
                        on the corporal's bed, to which he was securely strapped. <pb
                            id="VAA3892-386" n="372"/> A neatly contrived gag, used by Neffitt only
                        when he left the house, he explained, was in the man's mouth, and guaranteed
                        silence. The spy had slept in the bed both nights since he had been deprived
                        of his liberty, while his keeper had self-denyingly lain upon the hard, bare
                        floor. I say lain, for I doubt if he allowed himself to sleep. When the gag
                        was removed, Vawter offered no complaints as to his treatment, and only
                        wanted to know how long his detention was to continue. He was greatly
                        gratified to learn that it would be speedily at an end.</p>
                    <p>Eleven o'clock in the black shadows of the outer wall. Surely the drenching,
                        wind-driven rain falling from thick clouds adapted the night to the purposes
                        of those within that gloomy pile of stone. I had taken a position directly
                        opposite the East Hall, and flattening my back against the cold wall, which
                        afforded me some protection, waited. Neffitt had gone toward the shelter
                        house on the wall to the left, creeping along like a shadow, with the basket
                        containing the midnight feast swinging from his one hand.</p>
                    <p>It was horrible weather, and yet I rejoiced in it and even wished it were far
                        worse. There was no way to judge as to the time; I could only listen and
                        wait. It might be minutes or it might be hours that I must stay here, but
                        stay I would. A noise on the top of the wall at last! Someone was walking up
                        there, but cautiously, and <pb id="VAA3892-387" n="373"/> carrying a
                        lantern. It was the guard on the right going to join his comrade on the left
                        in his nocturnal negligence of duty. It was strange that they had not
                        suspected Neffitt, and there, in the pouring rain, I gave thought to the
                        corporal's eminent qualities as a strategist, and thought also of the
                        failure of Bellray.</p>
                    <p>After what seemed a very long time there was another noise on the wall to my
                        right, a dull clanking sound as of metal striking upon stone, quickly
                        followed by a scratching of the inner surface of the wall from the top
                        downward as if something had slipped over the coping, striking the surface
                        as it descended. A distant bell was striking midnight. Neffitt moved up to
                        me out of the blackness.</p>
                    <p>"They're comin'," he said at my ear in an eager, tremulous whisper.</p>
                    <p>"Who?" I whispered back fiercely, thinking of the guards and that he had
                        failed.</p>
                    <p>"The General--listen! They're tryin' to grapple the coping."</p>
                    <p>Again came the clanking noise, but this time it was not followed by the sound
                        of something falling. Instead, there came a faint, upward touching of the
                        inside of the wall as if now something was ascending. Then there was a
                        slight scraping on the top. Six times was this repeated, then something like
                        a rope dropped down, striking me as it fell, for I had changed my position
                            <pb id="VAA3892-388" n="374"/> It was made of coverings from the prison
                        beds, knotted together, and up there at the other end, grappling the top of
                        the wall, was the iron bar with which the fire had been stirred in the
                        corridor stove, now bent into a hook.</p>
                    <p>Looking upward, I saw between my eyes and the gray of the sky a darker object
                        like a man's head protruding over the coping. Through my hands I spoke my
                        name, and instantly a man came sliding down the rope. It was Captain Hines.
                        Hardly was he on the ground before another stood beside him. This was the
                        General himself.</p>
                    <p>"Come," said I; "Neffitt will look after the others."</p>
                    <p>"So the other one is your corporal, is it? Brave soul," said the General.</p>
                    <p>Without saying more he sought about until he got the corporal's one poor hand
                        in both of his own in a thankful grasp that repaid the poor fellow for all
                        his toil. Then away, while the others in silence were reaching the ground.
                        Straight we went to the railroad station, and boldly Hines, the ever daring,
                        procured tickets from the sleepy agent as though he were the most innocent
                        of travelers, while the General and I stood alone outside in the shelter of
                        the widely projecting eaves of the roof, I listening to expressions of his
                        gratitude of which my feeble efforts were wholly unworthy.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-389" n="375"/>
                    <p>Thank God that a train was due in a few minutes, and thank God that it came
                        and started when it was due to start! When we had entered the lighted car I
                        saw that both men were bleached by the four months of imprisonment--four
                        months to the very day. They wore citizens' clothes and now bore little
                        resemblance to the bronzed men in gray who had so desperately ridden the
                        northern highways under the July sun. On the train was a Federal officer in
                        uniform, with whom General Morgan engaged in conversation by tendering the
                        use of his flask just as the train passed near the walls of the prison which
                        he had so recently left.</p>
                    <p>"That," said the officer as he accepted the offered refreshment, "is the
                        hotel at which Morgan stops, I believe."</p>
                    <p>"Yes," responded the General, taking the returned flask and holding it before
                        him, "and will stop it is to be hoped. He has given us his fair share of
                        trouble, and he will not be released. I will drink to him: 'May he ever be
                        as closely kept as he is now.'"</p>
                    <p>And so all went pleasantly.</p>
                    <p>In due time we came to a suburb of Cincinnati. The rain had ceased. Captain
                        Hines rose and reached for the bell cord, giving it a warning jerk. The
                        train slowed down in obedience to the unofficial signal and we quickly got
                        off, we three, and hastened toward the river, the wide Ohio, that <pb
                            id="VAA3892-390" n="376"/> had suffered us to cross its bosom only that
                        we might be overwhelmed beyond. We reached it in the first feeble light of
                        the morning, and found a stout lad already upon its margin bailing overnight
                        rain out of a staunch little skiff. A liberal reward induced him to accept
                        two passengers for the Kentucky side; then hand clasps and "God bless
                        you's'' and they were swept out into the mist. I stood there and watched
                        them as they went. Where now were the patrolling war-boats? Where the
                        swarming foes, the dozen generals? And where, alas, the three thousand? I
                        stood and watched with strained eyes until they disappeared in the fog that
                        turned the opposite shore into a dim gray line. Good-bye, brave, indomitable
                        soul; and farewell!</p>

                        going into the street heard newsboys crying aloud about the escape of
                        Morgan, and there was great excitement and commotion. How many were there in
                        that more than one hundred thousand who rejoiced with me? Not many, surely.
                        I rested quietly during the day and that evening took boat down the river,
                        again a stranger among strangers.</p>
                    <p>Early the next morning, on awakening and looking out, I saw that we were tied
                        up at Louisville, where we had been since midnight. On the wharf was the man
                        Tapper who, more than a year before, had so artfully concealed his
                        recognition of my name as that of a possible conspirator, and so dutifully
                        and immediately reported me to his chief. I did not appear on deck until the
                        boat was again in midstream.</p>
                    <p>At nine o'clock we were opposite Brandenburg but did not mean to stop. There
                        were the heights from which our cannon had thundered so defiantly; over
                        there was the Indiana shore on which we had <pb id="VAA3892-392" n="378"/>
                        landed, and far beyond, past the now gray hills, the little valley to which
                        my troubled thoughts had turned.</p>
                    <p>After a little while there came into view, slumbering on the margin of the
                        river, the signal landing that Captain Bracken had been so anxious to reach
                        in time for the packet. And far up was the break in the bluff where the
                        horse-buyer had come to his end and I almost to mine, and where, down
                        beneath the roots of the leafless trees, was the vast chamber with the
                        reminding evidence of a lost race.</p>
                    <p>Presently came Leavenworth, and then the drive overland, bearing north of
                        east, in a hired conveyance that jolted and shook, up hill and down, through
                        the wet, clinging clay of the road. Over there was the entrance to the great
                        cavern where I had parted from the wounded spy. And here, as the sun dropped
                        low, was the road by the side of which I went to sleep in weariness, there
                        was the very rock against which I leaned, and here was where Captain Sivad's
                        men fought the Federals. Further along was the cross-roads where the
                        neighborhood Unionists had rejoiced over my General's downfall and
                        humiliated poor Bellray.</p>
                    <p>I could not tell why I had chosen the route by which I had returned, and
                        which called forth so many disagreeable recollections. But it was ended at
                        last and I was at home, stiff, sore and <pb id="VAA3892-393" n="379"/>
                        mud-splashed, but rejoicing in the knowledge that one undertaking had
                        prospered if many had failed. What mattered it now by what way I had come
                        since it brought me to the dear, patient mother and to that other one
                        waiting over there beyond?</p>
                    <p>The next morning I walked over to Bellray's. In the few weeks of my absence
                        he had greatly changed for the worse. He was more distrait and moody, and
                        his movements, once so active and determined, were now dull and heavy and
                        his mental powers much diminished. The symptoms portended collapse and gave
                        great anxiety to Kate and the few friends who were yet openly faithful. Dr.
                        White urged that he be taken to a specialist for an operation, and named an
                        eminent surgeon in New York, in which city he had received a part of his own
                        education. This step had already been agreed upon before my arrival, and
                        thither in December he was taken, accompanied by the doctor and Kate.</p>
                    <p>Word came to me in time, in a joyful note from the latter, that science had
                        triumphed and that Roger's mind was restored. This letter was followed by
                        another written a few days afterward, in which she said Roger had spoken to
                        her of his purpose to return to Indiana as soon as he was strong enough to
                        be released from the hospital, and hinted at vengeance against his enemies.
                        She was alone with him in the great city, Dr. <pb id="VAA3892-394" n="380"/>
                        White having returned home, and she was doing her best to dissuade him. She
                        had confided to the surgeon something of his history and surroundings, and
                        he had recommended a trip abroad in order that Roger might be removed from
                        excitements until at least he was able to bear them. About the middle of
                        March she wrote in great distress:</p>
                    <p>"Roger will leave the hospital in a week, and is determined to 'go back and
                        fight it out,' he says. On this subject he becomes very violent, though as
                        gentle as a child toward me always. The surgeon commands the trip, but Roger
                        says that he does not need it, and that he has other things to do. Whatever
                        these other things are, he must not do them. Oh, if you were only here! He
                        would listen to you. Can't you come and help me save him from the desperate
                        undertakings on which I know he is resolved? He grows more and more furious
                        every day, and vehemently denounces so many people. He does not seem like
                        the same man that he used to be. If he goes back there will be a tragedy
                        which will engulf him and add to the misery of us all. Can you come
                        speedily?"</p>
                    <p>This appeal decided me. The terms of my parole bound me not to take up arms
                        again until exchanged, and the suspension of the cartel left little hope of
                        that. I regretted this less since the destruction of my General's forces,
                        but my indifference I now admitted to myself, was largely because of my
                        mother's open opposition, and Kate's <pb id="VAA3892-395" n="381"/>
                        unexpressed but well understood wishes. And then, being removed from the
                        scene of the struggle, I saw the hopelessness of it, and knew that its
                        continuance only meant a prolongation of misery and blood-letting and an
                        increase of bitterness. The result was certain; the fabric of the
                        Confederacy was raveling and fast becoming ragged. Its resources were not
                        adequate to the demand for repairs. The North seemed as yet barely scathed,
                        and had men and means and credit to meet any emergency that might arise.</p>
                    <p>All these things were clear to me at last. Only a little more hammering and a
                        little closer drawing of the lines of blue and then the inevitable crash. If
                        I were there it would only be one more beneath the wreck. It was long indeed
                        before I could bring myself to these views and make up my mind that I was no
                        longer to be a participant in the battles still being bravely waged by my
                        people. Alas! What sacrifices they made and what sufferings they endured to
                        continue the struggle for a separation that would have wrought, as I now
                        believe, the ruin of our country.</p>
                    <p>The day after receiving Kate's last letter I started for New York. It would
                        not do at all to allow Roger Bellray to return to Indiana if it could be
                        prevented, and on my own part a sense of alienation that I could not
                        overcome made me restless. Therefore I welcomed the opportunity as
                        furnishing an excuse for my departure. <pb id="VAA3892-396" n="382"/> My
                        mother, prudent woman that she was, had kept her matters so well in hand
                        that there was no present difficulty about means. And so I had planned with
                        her that if things went according to my mind she should join me later in New
                        York, or wherever else I might determine to take up a temporary residence.
                        To this arrangement she readily agreed when she clearly understood its
                        purpose, and had considered that I would thereby be the sooner reconciled to
                        my enforced retirement from the service.</p>
                    <p>I reached the metropolis the day before the time appointed for Roger to leave
                        the hospital. Kate was living in the family of the surgeon who had
                        undertaken her brother's cure. There I found her that evening, well, indeed,
                        and more beautiful in my eyes than she had ever been-- which is saying
                        much--but torn by anxieties. I had not written of my coming, knowing that a
                        letter would travel no faster than I, nor had I used the telegraph. So until
                        she saw me she had no knowledge that I was on my way to join her. She rushed
                        into my arms with a surprised cry, and between smiles and tears asserted
                        that she had been on the verge of despair.</p>
                    <p>"If you had not come Roger would certainly have started home to-morrow," she
                        said tremblingly, after awhile. "We must not let him go; he is now so
                        extreme and bitter. He will gather his friends and will stop at nothing
                        short of violence, <pb id="VAA3892-397" n="383"/> for he considers that his
                        last rights as a citizen have been taken away."</p>
                    <p>I gave her such comforting words as came to me, but seriously doubted my
                        ability to change her brother's resolution, and yet I must try. When I had
                        left her and returned to my hotel I remained long awake thinking about the
                        best way to reach him. No ordinary arguments or appeals would answer, for he
                        was a very obdurate man and felt that he had been deeply wronged. At last I
                        went to sleep believing that I had found a pleasant solution of the
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>Early the next morning, in company with Kate, I went to see Roger. He was in
                        his room at the hospital and had his belongings packed ready to leave. When
                        we entered he was reading a newspaper but threw it aside and got up to
                        receive us, expressing agreeable surprise at seeing me. He looked strong and
                        his eyes were clear and keen as of old--keener, in truth, as though a fresh
                        fire flamed in their depths. Almost at once he began to make eager inquiries
                        as to the situation in Indiana. As I did not wish him to become aroused
                        until I had spoken of the matter that was on my mind, I led him away from
                        the scene of his grievances and back to ourselves.</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Bellray," I began, "I want to say something about myself--ourselves;
                        something I have come a thousand miles to say. A part of it you already
                        know."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3892-398" n="384"/>
                    <p>"Kate has told me all about you, John. At any rate she has told me a good
                        deal. You had a pretty tough time of it, didn't you?"</p>
                    <p>"Did she tell you all?" I asked, looking from him to Kate, who flushed at the
                        emphasis I placed on the last word.</p>
                    <p>"Not--not everything, John," she said quietly, as she smoothed out her gloves
                        on her knee.</p>
                    <p>"It is as I suspected--she has omitted the most important thing. She has
                        promised to marry me. And look here; we intend to go abroad on our wedding
                        journey and you are going with us."</p>
                    <p>Kate opened wide her eyes at the unfolding of a plan about which she had not
                        been consulted. Though taken by surprise she was quick enough to see my
                        purpose and to second it by a look of affectionate entreaty. Roger's face
                        clouded and he was about to speak, but I went on:</p>
                    <p>"No use growling, Bellray; we've got it all arranged. If you go back to
                        Indiana in your present frame of mind you will be killed. That probability
                        will not keep you away, of course, but you will be likely to kill somebody
                        else first, and you don't want to do that, I know. They are bitter about
                        finding the arms in your house and only let you off because of your cracked
                        head. Now that it's sound again some of them will try to give it another
                        thump. It's no use; the game is not worth the playing. I will send for my
                        mother and we will make a little family party and <pb id="VAA3892-399"
                            n="385"/> see the world. This thing will soon be ended over here and we
                        can come back and settle down. Now, honestly, isn't this the best thing to
                        do? They will not let me fight any more and you--you--''</p>
                    <p>I stumbled here, not knowing how he would take from me what was on my
                        tongue.</p>
                    <p>"Speak it out, John; and <hi rend="i">I won't;</hi> that's what you were
                        about to say. No harm in the truth."</p>
                    <p>"Well, then, and you won't, so what is there for us to do? Certainly we ought
                        not to go back there and amuse ourselves quarreling and fighting with our
                        neighbors."</p>
                    <p>"The sum of it all is," he said with twinkling eyes that dulled the sting of
                        his words, "you think I will be better off gallivanting about the world with
                        a pair of young fools on a honeymoon. Well, I will think about it."</p>
                    <p>And then he began to talk of something else, and presently we all went down
                        and Roger set about taking his leave of those in the institution whose
                        friendship he had acquired during his stay. At last when we had entered the
                        carriage that was waiting for us and were being whirled away he turned to
                        his sister and said:</p>
                    <p>"Kate, it looks like running away, but I think we had better obey the
                        Captain."</p>
