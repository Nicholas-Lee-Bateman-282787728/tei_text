            Interurban Railroads of Indiana
            By Glen A. Blackburn,

            Union Traction Companyâ€”Anderson-Marion
            
            For the origins of electric inter-city transit in Indiana one must look to the Gas Belt region around 
                        Marion
                    , Anderson and 
                        Muncie
                    . One of the first lines to be electrically operated between cities1 was that of the 
                        Marion
                     Electric Street Railway Company ($80,000)2 which was
                        incorporated3 August 21, 1889 by Eli Halderman, president;
                    Charles W. Halderman, secretary and treasurer; 
                        Warren
                     C. McWhenny, Oscar E. Halderman and Oscar A. Gale. Work was not started until the
                    spring of 1892; about August 1, 1893, the line was operated from 
                        Marion
                     to 
                        Jonesboro
                     and Gas City4 and the 
                  
                     1The word "interurban" was suggested to Mr. C. L.
                            Henry while visiting the World's Fair in 
                                Chicago
                             in 1893 where an "Intramural" railway was in operation. The
                            word was used by a writer in the Street Railway Journal on page 529 of the August 1893
                            number in describing a six-mile line just completed between Buffalo and Tonawanda, N. Y.
                            section south of 
                                Jonesboro
                             was partly graded. The summer of 1894 saw the completion of the line as far as
                            Summitville.
                  
                     2Increased to $100,000 September 8, 1891.
                  
                     3Many of the early interurbans were incorporated under the act of
                            June, 1860, which provided for incorporation of street railroads. Other companies were
                            incorporated under the general railroad act and afterwards, when interurbans were recognized
                            by law, filed with the secretary of state notice of determination to avail themselves of all
                            rights and powers of interurbans. Acts of March 11, 1901, and March 7, 1903, defined status
                            and privileges of interurbans similar to steam railroad companies.
                  
                     4All searches for official records concerning the opening of the line
                            have been fruitless. The franchise of the 
                                Marion
                             Electric Street Railway Company was extended on July 1, 1893, removing from
                            July 1st to August 15th the time limit before or on which cars must be operated.
               
                     section south of 
                        Jonesboro
                     was partly graded. The summer of 1894 saw the completion of the line as far as
                    Summitville.
            Other railway companies organized to build lines between 
                  Marion, Jonesboro
                and neighboring
                    towns were Queen City Electric Street Railway company ($150,000)5
                    incorporated February 27, 1891; 
                        Jonesboro
                     & 
                        Marion
                     Electric Railroad company ($50,000)6 incorporated
                    December 11, 1891; Queen City Electric Railway company ($150,000)7
                    incorporated June 30, 1892. The next attempt to construct a line between cities of the Gas Belt was
                    an effort of that persistent promoter of ill-fated electric railways, Mr. Noah J. Clodfelter. Not
                    only was 
                        Marion
                     to be connected with Anderson but 
                        Indianapolis
                     was to be reached by way of McCordsville, Ingalls, and Pendleton. The company was
                    incorporated September 5, 1894, as the 
                        Indianapolis

                        Alexandria

                        Marion
                     Electric Railway company. ($100,000). Surveys were made and the contract for
                    construction was let in November.8 Work was not begun that year, however, and
                    May 29, 1895, the company was reorganized and changed its name to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Anderson & 
                        Marion
                     Railway company ($500,000.) A loan of $500,000 was floated with
                    Lyman & Wilgus, 
                        New York
                    ,9 a private right-of-way was sought in Anderson because no
                    agreement could be made with the city lines, and in June, 1895, a small amount of work was done by
                    the Standard Construction company of 
                        New York
                    . It was intended to have the Anderson-
                        Marion
                     section ready for operation early in 1896, and later in the same year the Anderson-
                        Indianapolis
                     line. Late in 1895 work was resumed; in a short time cold weather stopped construction
                    after some poles had been set up, rails and ties distributed

                     at Summitville and rolling stock ordered.10
                    January 27, 1896, Mr. Clodfelter reorganized the company again, its new name being Indiana
                    Interurban Railway company ($50,000). The purpose of the reorganization was to finance
                    the Anderson-
                        Marion
                     section which was to be completed the following summer. Having secured financial
                    support, Mr. Clodfelter resumed grading in June, 1896,11 and most of the grading
                    between 
                        Fairmount
                     and 
                        Marion
                     was completed. A power house was erected at 
                        Fairmount
                     and others were begun at 
                  Alexandria,
                            Jonesboro
                and Anderson. A stringency in the
                    money market caused the work to be abandoned for the rest of the summer.
            In May, 1897, work was begun again on the grade and the power houses. The resources of the company
                    were exhausted so rapidly that very soon there was difficulty in paying the employees. June 1897,
                    nearly a hundred laborers working five miles south of 
                        Fairmount
                     went on a strike because they had not been paid for three weeks and mobbed the
                        foreman.12 August 30, 1897, the stockholders acknowledged insolvency and
                    James A. Bradford was appointed receiver. A total of $25,000 had been expended upon a few
                    miles of grading that had been done near 
                        Fairmount
                     and Gas City and some track that had been laid on the streets of 
                        Fairmount
                    . The properties of the 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Anderson & 
                        Marion
                     Railway company were ordered sold at receiver's sale by the court and were
                    purchased by the Union Traction company.13 Philip Matter purchased the
                    distributed ties and poles for $1,525 and the Anderson power house for $300.
                    The 
                        Fairmount
                     power house was taken by lien holders.
            The indefatigable Mr. Clodfelter thereupon organized the Indiana Traction Company
                        ($500,000).14 This company was to lay tracks between 
                        Marion
                     and 
                        Alexandria
                     to connect with

                        Alexandria
                     line which was nearly done and also between 
                        Elwood
                     and 
                        Alexandria
                    . It was stated by the promoters that bonds were placed and that construction would
                    commence as soon as weather conditions were favorable.15 Nothing, however, was
                    ever done.16
            
            The other pioneer in interurban railway construction in Indiana was Mr. Charles L. Henry of Anderson,
                    ex-congressman and capitalist whose efforts during the early history of the electric railway earned
                    for him the title, "Father of Interurbans". June 20, 1891, Mr. Henry bought the
                    Anderson City mule line; in April, 1892, in partnership with Philip Matter of 
                        Marion
                     he built an electrically operated line from the business section of Anderson to an
                    outlying tract of land which they had recently plotted and offered for sale. In the same year the
                    mule line was electrified.
            In the fall of 1892, Mr. Henry went to 
                        Missouri
                     and endeavored to buy certain city railway properties which he proposed to electrify
                    and extend to the neighboring towns, but was unable to effect the purchase. In 1893 he returned to
                    Indiana with the intention of building interurban lines but this purpose was also frustrated by the
                    panic of 1893. Two years later in May, lines from Anderson to 
                        Marion
                     and

                    February, 1895, Mr. Henry contracted for the Citizens Street Railway company of 
                        Indianapolis
                     to haul interurban cars over the city tracks. The approaching financial depression and
                    the campaign of 1896 delayed the plans again.
            Finally September 3, 1897, the Union Traction company ($300,000) was incorporated by

                    old companies received the same amounts of stock in the new.
            By the fall of 1899 the grading from 
                        Muncie
                     to 
                        Indianapolis
                     was nearly done, but it was not finished until the next summer after franchises had
                    been secured in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . November, 1901, a contract was made with the city whereby the company agreed to pay a
                    tax of five cents per round trip for a period of seven years, fifteen cents for the next ten years,
                    and twenty-five cents for the following fifteen years.20
            
            In March, 1900, the Panhandle at Anderson refused to permit the traction company to cross its Belt
                    line at Anderson. A switch was built across Arrow Avenue by the steam line, cars were placed on it
                    and the point of the switch was torn out. During the consequent delay an injunction was obtained by
                    the steam road forbidding the molestation of the railroad's property. In July the
                    restraining order was dissolved and the crossing constructed.21

                    electric railways in the world, a system which comprised 163 miles of track, 56 of which was in the
                    cities of 
                  Marion, Muncie
               , Anderson,

                        Elwood
                    .22 Cars were run every hour and required about one and one-half
                    hours for the trip. The first freight car began making daily runs in July, 1902.23
            
            At 
                        Marion
                     the Union Traction had a long fight with the city council concerning the operation of
                    the city lines. March 25, 1902, the 
                        Marion
                     Transit company ceased operation without permission and merged with the Union Traction
                    company. July 1, the council forfeited the city railway franchise and six weeks later ordered the
                    company to remove its tracks.24 Mr. McCulloch, president of the Union Traction
                    company, protested against the order because his company intended to use the tracks. One year later
                    the franchises of the Union Traction company were taken up and a new one given in return for which
                    the Union Traction company was to sell part of the city tracks to the 
                  Kokomo, Marion
                &
                    Western Traction company, remove certain rails from certain streets and make stipulated improvements
                    in paving between the tracks.
            A curve over White River three miles west of Anderson, where two serious
                    accidents had occurred, was straightened in 1907 and another at the Pendleton-
                        Fall Creek
                     crossing was reduced two years later. During 1909 a thirty foot strip was bought for a
                    great part of the way between 
                        Indianapolis
                     and Anderson for the purpose of laying a second track. No construction has been done on
                    the project, however.

            Interurban lines in Indiana were built in short sections; this feature was partly a result of the
                    conviction among traction men that electric locomotion was best adapted to local carrying and would
                    never displace steam power for moving long distance and heavy traffic and partly a consequence of
                    the difficulty of securing any great amount of capital in the

                     young industry. The short units were early amalgamated into
                    small systems. The connecting spur between 
                        Tipton
                     and 
                        Alexandria
                     is an illustration of this characteristic.

                        Alexandria
                     line was built by the 
                        Elwood
                     & 
                        Alexandria
                     Railway company ($225,000) which was incorporated May 4, 1898.1 Being a short line and presenting few engineering difficulties, twelve months time was
                    sufficient to build the railway. The first car was run June 26, 1899.2
            
            The following year the Union Traction company of Indiana sought franchises and right-of-ways for a
                    continuation of the line to 
                        Tipton
                    . Although it was April, 1902, before construction started the line was ready for
                    operation that fall. The opening was delayed several weeks because of a dispute with the Lake Erie
                    & Western railroad, which paralleled the electric line, over a crossing three miles west of 
                        Elwood
                    .3 The steam road demanded that the traction company provide a
                    watchman; the long negotiations caused the Union Traction company some difficulty in securing an
                    extension of the time limit clause in their 
                        Elwood
                     franchise. Finally, an agreement was reached between the two companies and on the last
                    day of the year 1902 at 9:30 P. M. a car made the trip from 
                        Elwood
                     to 
                        Tipton
                    .4 In February, 1903, the Union Traction company of Indiana, who had
                    purchased the 
                        Elwood
                    -

                        Alexandria
                     and 
                        Tipton
                    . The line furnishes a convenient link between the Anderson and Peru divisions of the
                    Union Traction company.

                     met with indifferent reception as soon as the Union Traction company entered the field.
                    By September, 1902, arrangements were so far completed that the contract was let and construction
                    was begun. Twelve months later, after completing the grade, building many bridges, and laying
                    several miles of steel near 
                        Alexandria
                    , the company found itself unable to raise funds to complete the road. The project
                    rested until the high price of steel during the World War made it profitable to salvage the rails.

                    of 5% on one-half of the capital stock which on June 18, had been converted into preferred

            January, 1898, Senator Gifford and several other citizens of 
                        Tipton
                     organized the 
                        Atlanta
                     Transportation company for the purpose of building a six mile line from

                        Tipton
                     and perhaps reaching to Windfall, Sharpsville and Kempton.6 A
                    larger venture was that of the Indiana Central Railway company ($50,000) incorporated
                    August 30, 1901, to build from

                     north of Arcadia.12 The first plan was to
                    touch Broad Ripple, 
                        Westfield
                     and Arcadia and run north through 
                        Kokomo
                     where a spur was to connect with 
                        Tipton
                    ; but, owing to difficulties with the city officials at 
                        Noblesville
                    , the route was made to turn east from that point toward 
                        Elwood
                    . Some construction was done the following spring. It was rumored that Union Traction
                    interests were working in harmony with the constructing company.13
            
            The rumor was verified. April 14, 1892, the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Northern Traction company, a $3,500,000 corporation was
                    incorporated by those interested in the Union Traction company, Charles A. Baldwin, William H.
                    Bloss, Ellis C. Carpenter, Henry Moore, Albert S. Richey, Arthur Brady, Charles Berry. The articles
                    of incorporation stated that the purpose of the company was to "build, buy or
                    rent" lines of electric railway in any of the cities north and east of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The new company resumed the work of constructing the grade at the point where the
                    Indiana Central Railway company stopped. The town of Carmel offered to obtain the right-of-way
                    gratis between Broad Ripple and Carmel if the line were run through that place. In May, ties were
                    distributed and grading was begun on the southern end of the line. July 16, 1902, the stockholders
                    of the Union Traction company after considerable internal opposition voted to lease and later to
                    merge with the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Northern Traction company. The lessee held the $3,500,000 common
                    capital stock of the lessor as security for guaranteeing a $5,000,000 bond issue with the
                    Colonial Trust company of 
                        New York
                    .14 In May, 1903, the merging of the two companies was ratified by
                    the two boards of directors.15 After uniting with the Indiana Northern Traction company the Union
                    Traction company was said to be the largest traction corporation in the world. For the year ending

                    of Italians were employed. September, 1903, cars began running between 
                        Tipton

                        Indianapolis
                     through Broad Ripple over the tracks of the Broad Ripple Traction company,17 most of whose stock was held by the same persons that owned that of the Union
                    Traction company. The short line was absorbed and managed by the Indiana Union Traction company in
                    January, 1905.
            In March, 1896, C. E. Everetts had promoted a line from 
                        Logansport
                     to 
                        Indianapolis

                        Noblesville
                    , Mattsville and Broad Ripple and subsidies had been voted along the line. Two years
                    later Dr. Robert C. Light, of Broad Ripple, entertained similar plans and incorporated the 
                        Indianapolis

                    Northern Traction company who had laid its track over night, the 
                        Wabash
                     River Traction company secured a restraining order against Mr. Marott enjoining the use
                    of Erie avenue and Fifth street. A short time afterward the Boyd syndicate purchased Mr.
                    Marott's holdings in 
                        Logansport
                     and laid its tracks on Erie avenue without interruption.21

                        Kokomo
                     was undertaken by the Union Traction company during the summer of 1903. The lines were
                    opened for traffic about August 1, 1904.22
            
            Marion-Wabash
            
            Late in the fall of 1902 surveyors went over the route of a proposed line between 
                        Marion
                     and 
                        Wabash
                    . February 24, 1903, the Indiana Northern Traction company ($25,000) was
                    incorporated to build between the towns and north to North 
                        Manchester
                     and 
                        Warsaw
                    .1 The contract for grading was given to J. G. White &
                    Company of 
                        New York
                    
               2 and an agreement was made with President McCulloch permitting the
                    use of the Union Traction company tracks in 
                        Marion
                    .
            The work of grading and track-laying progressed rapidly. At Fox Station south of 
                        Wabash
                     it was feared that an injunction would be served when the company started to build
                    through a cemetery; a number of workers were assembled, the materials were timed to arrive at
                    nightfall, and under cover of darkness the track was laid without hindrance. In the next year the
                    line was completed. The first power house at Lafountaine was abandoned for a larger and newer one at
                    north 
                        Marion
                    . January 1, 1905, the eastern financiers surrendered control of the line to the 
                        Marion
                     men who had purchased the capital stock.3

            December 2, 1905, the Indiana Northern Traction company, for the sum of about $500,000

                        Marion
                     power house to the Union Traction company whose chief purpose for the deal was to
                    establish limited service between 
                        Indianapolis
                     and Ft. 
                        Wayne

            Anderson-Middleton
            
            In the spring of 1900 the Union Traction company surveyed a route between Daleville, which was on the Anderson-
                        Muncie
                     line, and Middleton, whose merchants were eager to have another outlet besides the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     railroad. So much difficulty arose in securing the right-of-way that within a year the
                    project was abandoned and a line from Anderson was discussed.
            February 12, 1902, the merchants of Anderson, with the purpose of forestalling the possibility of a
                    line from Daleville which would be disadvantageous to them, organized an electric railway company
                    which was incorporated February 16, as the Merchants Traction Company ($150,000).1
            
            By May 1, deeds for the right-of-way had been secured and the attempt appeared so feasible that 
                        Newcastle
                     merchants urged the Merchants Association to continue their line through to 
                        Richmond
                    .2 The contract for grading was let, and an agreement was made with
                    the Union Traction company to obtain power.3
            
            The association was now ready for some other company to take over its holdings and complete the line.
                    The 
                        Richmond
                     & Northwestern Traction company, a venture of Lowe's 
                        Dayton
                     system, was actively promoting its 
                        Richmond
                    -
                        Newcastle
                    -Anderson scheme. A representative, Gus M. Hodges, came to Anderson in June and
                    negotiated a transfer of the holdings of the Merchants Traction company in August, 1902.

            December 3, 1902, Anderson extended the city franchise of the Union Traction company until 1952 and
                    in return the traction company was to build repair shops, car barns, enlarge the local power plant,
                    and build lines from Anderson to 
                        Elwood
                     and from Daleville to Middleton.4 After buying the
                    Anderson-Middleton properties and franchises from Gus Hodge5 the company
                    discarded Daleville as a terminus and began construction from Anderson in the spring of 1903.
                    Probably a consideration in building the line from Anderson was the fact that a better connection
                    could be established at 
                        Newcastle
                     with the Dunreith spur of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Eastern Traction company.
            When the trackage was almost completed to Middleton, construction southeast of the town ceased
                    because of financial conditions, perhaps, and the distributed materials were gathered up.6 The Anderson-Middleton short line was placed in operation August 1, 1905.7 The scheme of completing the Anderson-
                        Newcastle
                     connection has been frequently revived but always without a success.

            Early in 1902, Dr. Joseph E. Lowes and John E. Feight with other 
                  Dayton, Ohio
               , capitalists
                    began promoting a line to connect 
                        Muncie
                     with 
                  Dayton, Ohio
               , via Winchester, Union City and Greenville, 
                        Ohio
                    . July 18, 1902, the Union City, Winchester & 
                        Muncie
                     Traction company ($10,000) was incorporated.1 The
                    company was to build from 
                        Muncie
                     to the state line at Union City where the Greenville & Union City Traction
                    company, of 
                        Ohio
                    , would connect. September 29, 1902, the company was reorganized under the same name
                    with E. P. Mathews, 
                  Dayton, Ohio
               , added to the directorate.
            In the spring of 1903 construction was started on the Winchester-Union City end and a power house at

                     was begun. The line was completed by next year as far west from
                    the state line as Farmland. It was not until the fall of 1905 that the 
                        Muncie
                     terminal was reached.2

                    affairs of the new company; of the 8,000 shares of stock ($100 each) issued by the
                    consolidated company, the Indiana company received 6,500 and the 
                        Ohio
                     company 1,500. An $800,000 issue of bonds was sold to complete the road.

                    directors, all being officials of the Union Traction Company. A few days later the 
                        Muncie
                    -Union City line was sold to the new company and after July 1, 1906, it was operated as
                    a division of the Indiana Union Traction company.3 In July an issue of
                    $925,000, 5% thirty year, gold bonds by the new company and the interest thereon were
                    guaranteed by the Indiana Union Traction company and the entire capital stock of the issuing company
                    was, therefore, turned over to the guarantor.4

            Interest in these projects lanquished until August 9, 1902 when the 
                        Muncie

                    was to run from 
                        Muncie
                     to 
                        Portland

                        Ohio
                     cities. Surveys were made and some franchises obtained.
            Finally, July 7, 1905 another

                    , Redkeye and Dunkirk.4 That fall construction work was started and
                    one year after its organization the company began operating cars over the line.5
            
            June 15, 1916, one-half of the capital stock was converted into 5% preferred stock and on June 30,
                    the line was leased to the 
                  Indianapolis, Newcastle

                    turned over the operation of the line to its own lessee, the Union Traction company of Indiana.

                     until July, 1903, when Charles S. Hernley, a railway promoter and politician, in
                    collaboration with W. W. and W. J. Hubbard and Charles T. Boyle began organizing a company for the
                    purpose of building a line to 
                        Newcastle
                     through Shirley and along the Eastern Division of the Peoria & Eastern
                    railroad. Finally on November 7, 1903, the 
                        Newcastle
                     & Winchester Traction company ($100,000) was incorporated.2 The

                        Ohio
                     was to be made later with

                  Toledo, Ohio
                was the ultimate objective. On November 23, 1904 another
                    company was organized by the promoters with a capitalization of $3,500,000.3 It was called the

                     to all of the surrounding territory. delphia was given the contract for furnishing
                    electrical equipment.5
            
            In March, 1905, the city of 
                        Indianapolis
                     granted a franchise permitting the use of certain streets for an entrance and provided
                    for the construction of a belt line around the city to pass through Millersburg, Lawrence, Mallot
                    Park, Mt. Nebo, Broad Ripple, Poplar Grove, Flackville, through Eagle Creek Valley, past the State
                    Fair grounds and through the army post. At Millersburg it would connect with the main line to 
                        Newcastle
                    .
            By July, 1905, all stock had been sold and in the same month a $4,500,000 bond issue was
                    taken by

            One hundred teams began grading at 
                        Newcastle
                    , August 14, 1906. The following month a $40,000 power plant was started at
                    the Elliot farm near 
                        Newcastle
                    . One of the chief engineering difficulties encountered was the Blue
                    River Valley grade which was a mile long and required several hundred men nearly a year
                    to complete. During November, 1907, the Electrical Installation company completed the grading and
                    was engaged in laying track. September 5, 1907, the stockholders voted to raise the capital stock to
                    $4,500,000.
            Because of failure to pay the contractors, a lien of $150,000 was filed against the
                    interurban company and a receiver requested. No opposition was offered by the defendants to the suit
                    and the Union Trust company of 
                        Indianapolis
                     was named receiver.6
            
            The receiver and creditors agreed that receivers certificates to the amount of $450,000
                    were needed and would be issued to complete the line. D. M. Parry, Eli Marvin, W. E. Stevenson,
                    Eugene Bundy and Charles Hernley offered $200,000 realty and properties as security for
                    the issue of certificates.
            After considerable litigation the court ordered an issue of $460,000, 6%
                    receiversâ€™ certificates and the line was pushed to completion. The first part to be
                    opened was the section between 
                        Newcastle
                     and Shirley, which was operated in January, 1910; the first car to make the trip to 
                        Indianapolis
                     was run April 4, 1910.7 Regular service was not opened at once
                    because of difficulty in arranging connection with the city line at 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The company desired the use of 18th, 19th or Park streets in order to reach 
                        Massachusetts
                     Avenue, but these entrances were refused by the Board of Works and the company was
                    compelled to use 20th street. Permission to use the street was granted May 18 and by the first of
                    July the track was completed and regular passenger and fr.eight service between 
                        Indianapolis
                     and 
                        Newcastle
                     was established.

                & Eastern Traction company ($1,000,000)
                    was incorporated June 1, 1912. The properties of the insolvent railway company were sold at
                    foreclosure sale to the new organization;8 a $1,200,000 bond issue
                    which was used to satisfy receiversâ€™ certificates, and which is still outstanding, was
                    filed with the Fidelity Trust company of 
                        Philadelphia
                    , June 1, 1912; and the capital stock was called in and cancelled in favor of a new
                    issue of one million dollars. The properties were leased October 25, 1912 to the Union Traction
                    company, who by agreement, pays operating expenses, taxes, interest on outstanding bonds, 5% on
                    preferred capital stock and $525 annual dividends on common stock, $10,420
                    incidental rent and an agreed sum to help maintain the organization of lessee.9
            
            June 30, 1916, the 
                        Muncie

                        Portland
                     Traction company which was already controlled through stock ownership by the Union
                    Traction company was leased by the 
                  Indianapolis,

                & Eastern Traction
                    company and was operated as a division of the Union Traction company.10
            
            Newcastle-Muncie
            
            In the early part of 1901, E. T. Ice began buying right-of-way for a line that was to connect
                            
                  Muncie, Newcastle
                and ultimately 
                        Cincinnati
                    . In March a survey was made and during that summer several franchises were secured. The
                    project seemed uncertain for nearly a year, apparently because of lack of financial support, but by
                    June, 1902, 
                        Boston
                     capitalists had promised support and Mr. Ice and another promoter, J. H. Davidson, had
                    enlarged their plans by proposing to build beyond 
                        Muncie
                     to 
                        Alexandria
                     and Normal City. In June the 
                        Madison
                     county and 
                        Alexandria
                     city franchises were secured, and August 8, 1902, the enterprise was incorporated 
                  
                     8John P. Todd, Frank Thompson, Fred A. Likely, William Winter, and
                            Blythe Hendricks were directors. The 
                        Indianapolis, Newcastle
                     
                            & Northeastern T. Co. ($10,000) incorporated by Jas. Elliot, Geo. Elliott
                            and Edgar Elliot was thought to be organized to buy the line at the sale.

                        Alexandria
                     Traction company ($10,000)1 All right-of-ways were
                    secured between 
                        Newcastle
                     and 
                        Muncie
                     and the new company contemplated an extension through 
                        Cambridge
                     City, Dunreith and Knights-town to 
                        Connersville
                    . The farmers living along the proposed line were so eager to have it built that they
                    voluntarily graded large portions of the right-of-way.
            The attempt to connect 
                        Newcastle
                     and 
                        Muncie
                     dragged for three years. In September, 1905, the 
                  Indianapolis, Newcastle
               
                    & 
                        Toledo
                     Traction company began clearing the right-of-way for an extension of its line to 
                        Muncie
                    . Effort was concentrated upon the western end, however, when funds became scarce, and
                    work was stopped on the 
                        Muncie
                     division.
            In July, 1912, the Union Traction company which had recently secured the Honey Bee route and wished
                    to connect it with its main 
                        Indianapolis
                    -
                        Dayton
                     line, surveyed a right-of-way between the two cities. The next month the survey was
                    extended to 
                        Richmond
                    . In October the Fisher Welsh Construction company of 
                        Indianapolis
                     was given the contract and by August, 1913, had completed the line.2

            It has already been recounted how C. L. Henry organized the Union Traction company, September 3,
                    1897, and built from Anderson to Summitville where connection was made with the 
                        Marion
                     City Railway company line from 
                        Marion
                    . June 19, 1899, the 
                        Marion
                     City line was purchased by the Union Traction company1 and eight
                    days later the

                     in the enterprise through his western representative, Hugh
                        McGowan.2 After the line to 
                        Indianapolis
                     was completed the growing trade inspired the officials to expand the system.
            The 
                        Indianapolis
                     Northern Traction company organized by Union Traction officials to take up the
                    properties and rights of the Central Traction company voted to consolidate July 16, 1902 and the
                    following May the action was ratified by both directorates. The capital stock was
                    $8,500,000, an amount equal to the sum of the capital stock of the two companies.
            June 9, 1903 the Indiana Union Traction company ($5,000,000) was incorporated by Horace C.
                    Stillwell, Ellis C. Carpenter, Charles W. McGuire, Harry F. Guthrie, Edgar A. Turpin, Charles R.
                    Leas and Arthur Brady. The company, whose directors were stockholders in the old Union Traction
                    company of Indiana, operated the lines of the latter company by terms of a lease. May, 1912, the two
                    companies, by vote of their stockholderss were merged into a new Union Traction Company of Indiana
                    with a capital stock of $9,000,000. The merger was declared to be necessary in order to
                    make needed improvements.3 During the year 1912 several injunction proceedings were instituted
                    enjoining the consolidation of the two companies, the opponents of the merger invoked a clause in an
                    Indiana statute which provided that "one of the merging companies must be operating its own
                    line," but in the fall of 1915 the State Supreme court declared that the merger was legal.4
            All except $4,000 of the authorized issue of $9,000,000 capital stock is
                    issued. There is now an outstanding bonded indebtedness 
                  
                     2Hugh J. McGowan, one of the most prominent traction operators and a
                            widely known citizen of Indiana, was born in 
                                Missouri
                            , January 24, 1867. He was successively farmer boy, hostler, agent for Barber
                            Asphalt Co. and gas promoter. He became interested in electric railways, and, through the
                            syndicate which he represented took over the 
                                Indianapolis
                             city car lines, and supervised erection of the large Terminal Building. He died

            Michigan City-Goshen
            
            The decade beginning in the year 1895 was an active period of promoting, merging and constructing
                    interurban railways in the region around 
                        South Bend
                     and other cities in the north tier of counties. Laporte and 
                        Michigan
                     City were especially favored by ambitious capitalists most of whom dreamed of, and a
                    few worked at, schemes of connecting the two cities. What proved to be a very profitable line was
                    the one from 
                        South Bend
                     to 
                        Goshen
                    ; its success led to an impossible number of promotions throughout northern Indiana.

            The attention of railway builders was next turned toward routes west from 
                        South Bend

                        Michigan
                     City and Laporte. Seven years later Mr. Harrison revived the scheme under the name of

                     line but its franchise was revoked because of failure to comply with orders from the
                    county commissioners regarding the grading on the public highway.10

                    been a profitable one; in the official report for 1910 it was called the "most prosperous
                    in the country." During 1921 the total operating revenues were $1,252,504;

            Surveys for the extension to Seymour began in the spring of 1905. Much difficulty was met in securing
                    the right-of-way south of 
                        Columbus
                    : the

                        Columbus
                     at grade level on a private right-of-way. Upon petition of the traction company, the
                    city council opened 
                        Madison
                     Avenue across the railroad tracks and a city franchise was then granted. The decision
                    of the Circuit Court that an under or overhead crossing was not practical was sustained by the State
                    supreme court and the traction company was allowed to cross at grade.4 Grading
                    began on the extension May 31, 1905 and the first car was operated September 28, 1907.5 May, 1910, the track was laid with new rails and in April, 1911, several miles of second

                     called upon to test the legality of an electric line handling
                    freight. At first the merchants objected to the unwieldly cars blocking the streets; but after their
                    rapid and convenient service was demonstrated and the early experience of the company proved
                    somewhat unprofitable, the attitudes of the merchants and traction officials were reversed. Many
                    electric railway officials come to consider the freight business an expensive accommodation because
                    of the extra equipment and men needed. At the present time the freight handling is one of the most
                    hopeful outlooks for the interurban officials and it is being eagerly encouraged by most of the
                    traction lines. September 7, 1912, the 
                  Indianapolis,

                        Charleston
                     during the summer of 1906.1 The company made many surveys for a
                    line to Corydon, West Baden and French Lick.2 The New

                    on the funded debt since October, 1908. John W. Greely, of

            In November, 1898, two 
                        Greenfield
                     men, Wm. C. Dudding and F. G. Banker, secured franchises and right-of-way for a line
                    from Anderson to 
                        Greenfield
                     and thence to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , at the same time that Elmer J. Binford from the same city was seeking franchises for a
                    line from 
                        Indianapolis
                     to 
                        Richmond
                    . Two months later Chas. M. Cooper and Nathaniel Morris of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , both representing independent interests, applied for a free right-of-way along the
                    National road. Three of the groups of capitalists pooled interests and chartered the 
                        Indianapolis

                        Greenfield
                     Rapid Transit company ($100,000).1 September, 1899, the
                    capital stock was increased by an additional issue of $390,000, and the following month
                    work began on the sixteen mile line. Construction was carried on so rapidly that a trial car
                    carrying officials of the line and press representatives made the trip to 
                        Greenfield
                     June 13, 1900.
            Several stockholders of the company organized the Central Traction company, afterwards called the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Eastern Traction company.2 They began surveying a route from 
                        Greenfield
                     to 
                        Knightstown

                        Richmond
                     scheme. The 
                        Greenfield
                    -Charlottsville section was placed in operation in May, 1902. Before the remaining part
                    of the

                                Greenfield
                            , and John J. Cooper of

                            .

                     Eastern railway planned to connect with the line of the 
                        Richmond
                     Street & Interurban Railway company then building from 
                        Richmond
                     to 
                        Dublin
                    .
            While the line from 
                        Greenfield
                     to 
                        Indianapolis
                     was constructed first, 
                        Richmond
                     and the small towns to the west were the first to be visited by the surveyors and stock
                    agents. As early as August, 1895, a plan to connect their city with 
                        Connersville
                     and Liberty received the support of the citizens of 
                        Richmond
                    .3 Three years later N. J. Clodfelter, the pioneer promoter of
                    interurbans in the Gas Belt, promised to construct a line from 
                        Richmond
                     to 
                        Connersville
                    . The next year more plans were made, the most promising being the scheme of Benjamin
                    Starr, John Barnes, B. F. Wissler, W. K. Bradbury and John H. Roling, who chartered the 
                        Richmond
                     Interurban Railway company for the purpose of building the much desired line east from 
                        Richmond
                     through 
                        Centerville
                    , East 
                  Germantown, Cambridge
                City to 
                        Dublin
                    .4 The Union Trust company of 
                        St. Louis
                     owned a majority of the stock.
            After failing twice to obtain franchises along the National Road, J. M. Lontz and Perry Freeman were
                    successful in April, 1900, and one year later the eastern capitalists whom they represented
                    organized the 
                        Richmond
                     Street & Interurban Railway company.5
            
            The company obtained a ready access to the streets of

                        Richmond

                    several months, was resumed and in January, 1905, buffet and parlor car service was run in

            In the spring of 1906 the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Eastern changed the location of some of the rural stations, the location of
                    which, as the residents along the line insisted, was fixed in the company's franchise, and,
                    therefore, could not be changed. The land owners in 
                        Hancock
                     county, whose farms adjoined the right-of-way, also complained that the traction
                    company failed tq maintain the road at the specified grade level, a condition which made it nearly
                    impossible to cross the tracks.10 Upon petition of the property owners, the
                    county commissioner revoked the franchise of the company and ordered the tracks removed from the
                    National Road.11 In February, 1908, a suit of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Eastern railway secured the voiding of the county commissioner's
                    order.
            In the spring of 1907 the traction company became involved in a controversy with the city of 
                        Richmond
                     that endured for six years. The city wished to exclude freight cars from the principal
                    street, but the interurban company objected

                            Findlay, O., on the 30th of Dec., 1905, the last link was completed in a line that connected 
                                Indianapolis

                     to the expense of constructing a freight line. Another
                    grievance against the traction company was the failure to pave between its tracks as required in its
                    franchise. In June, 1907, the city council threatened to revoke the franchise of the 
                        Richmond
                     Street Railway company,12 and the following month passed an
                    ordinance forbidding the 
                        Dayton
                     & Western to use the streets of the city.13 The
                            
                  Terre Haute, Indianapolis
                & Eastern, which had succeeded to the
                    interests of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Eastern and also was controlled by the same interests as the 
                        Dayton
                     and Western, retaliated by operating the freight cars of the 
                        Dayton
                     & Western inside the city limits. Later a building was leased outside the east
                    corporate limits of the city for use as a freight house.
            After a series of legal battles fought by the traction companies, the city council and committees of
                    the citizens, who opposed the proposition of the council to compel the interurban company to build a
                    freight line through Glen Miller park, the line was built through the park and a freight house in
                    north 
                        Richmond
                     was used by the 
                  Terre Haute,
                            Indianapolis
                & Eastern and the 
                        Dayton
                     & Western. The citizens still maintained that the railway tracks marred the
                    beauty of the park; and in the spring of 1911, the city council, which had reversed its position,
                    now belligerently ordered the traction company to remove its, track from the park.14 The city asserted that the council's permission to build tracks in Glen Miller was
                    illegal. After more litigation the company began removing its tracks from the park in June, 1913.15

                        Newcastle

                    hauling passengers to the

                     Old Settlers picnic.16
            
            In 1906, the Schoepf-McGowan syndicate who then owned the line was considering a shortening of the 
                        Indianapolis
                    -
                        Newcastle

                        Greenfield
                    , a distance of 23 miles. The amount of time by which the schedule could be shortened
                    was not deemed sufficient, however, to compensate for the construction of 23 miles of new track;
                    besides, a rival line was being promoted from 
                        Indianapolis
                     to 
                        Newcastle
                    . Consequently the proposal was dropped.

            The region around 
                        Terre Haute
                     enjoyed an unusual share of early promotions. Before the feasibility of extending
                    electric lines over the rough country roads and fields was demonstrated in Indiana, several street
                    railways had been organized in 
                        Terre Haute
                     and 
                        Brazil
                     whose purpose was to build lines on city streets and on roads leading out of the city.
                    The first of these was the

                        Brazil
                     Rapid Transit Street Railway company ($75,000) was incorporated. The
                    organizers declared their intention of building a line from Cottage Hill cemetery in 
                        Brazil
                     to Knightsville and Harmony along the National road.18 The line began operations July

                        Brazil
                     Rapid Transit Street Railway company was used for most of the distance between Harmony
                    and

                        Clay county
                     refused a franchise along the National road.20
            
            Still another railway was proposed by the

                    1899, construction started,22 and the following September was completed.23
            
            June 1, 1903, the company was reorganized for the purpose of building lines radiating from the city.
                    It was known as the

                     December 26, of the same year the company that built the
                    present line was incorporated as the

                     men: Charles F. Smith, Emmet M. Smith, Joseph Littell, Philip Goetz and John B. Bright,
                    who organized the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Western Traction company ($100,000), incorporated January 4, 1902.
                    One month later the authorized capital stock of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Western Traction company was raised to $500,000 and a bond issue
                    of the same amount was authorized. Before all arrangements could be made the line promoted by Henry
                    Smith began operating cars between 
                        Indianapolis
                     and 
                        Plainfield

                        Indianapolis
                     Coal Traction company.30
            
            In 1905 the Dolan-Morgan-McGowan syndicate purchased the line and in September began unloading ties
                    at 
                        Greencastle
                     for the western extension of their 
                        Danville
                     line. The syndicate changed their plans the following summer, and, in the face of
                    threatened resistance by the Vandalia railroad, who alleged that the traction company could not
                    legally build from 
                        Plainfield
                     because the terms of the 
                        Danville
                     franchise required an extension from that place, surveyed a route from

                        only.36 After a wearying and fruitless litigation lasting over two years the

                            E. F. Branch, of Martinsville; Benjamin C. Stevenson and James Stevenson, of 
                                Indianapolis
                            , as directors.
                  
                     2Incorporated June 9, 1899. Capital raised to $900,000,
                            July 16, 1903. The Incorporators were Daniel Lesley, Albert W. Moore, William A. Perkins,
                            Joseph T. Gist and Sylvan W. Kuhn.
               
                     Belt. Farmers along the proposed route subscribed
                    $50,000 in tickets. July 16, 1903, the name was changed to 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Southwestern Traction company because the company planned to build through 
                        Bloomington
                     to 
                        Vincennes
                     and 
                        Evansville
                    .
            The 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Martinsville Traction company ($10,000) incorporated July 11,
                    1899, was another unsuccessful attempt.3
            
            The 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Southwestern Traction company ($50,000) was still another scheme
                    to connect Martinsville with the state capital.4 The route was surveyed parallel
                    to the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & 
                        Vincennes
                     Railroad.
            Finally, April 24, 1901, the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Martinsville Rapid Transit Company ($100,000) was incorporated.
                    Work was started in a short time and by November 12, 1901, when the capital was raised to
                    $750,000 the roadbed was graded as far as 
                        Mooresville
                    . In order to complete the line a thirty-year-$750,000 5% mortgage was
                    executed January 1, 1902 by Security Trust company of 
                        Indianapolis
                    .5 Hourly service as far as 
                        Mooresville
                     began August 11, 1902 and as far as Martinsville in April, 1903.3
            
            In June, 1903, a survey was made for an extension to 
                        Bloomington
                    ; an entrance into the coal field through Paragon, Gosport, 
                        Spencer
                    , Northington, Clinton and Sullivan was also considered. The engineering difficulties
                    which the country has always presented, together with the meagre prospect for traffic, discouraged
                    these extensions.
            In June, 1905, a 
                        Boston
                     syndicate headed by Stone and Webster, who were investors in 
                        Terre Haute
                     lines, bought $75,000 capital stock of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Martinsville Rapid Transit company, thereby obtaining a controlling vote in
                    the

                    afterwards was transferred to the Schoepf-McGowan syndicate and is now all held by the

                    of the qualifying shares of the directors. April 1, 1907, the line was leased to the
                            
                  Terre Haute, Indianapolis
                & Eastern Traction company for a period of

            Indianapolis-Lafayette
            
            One of the bitterest struggles between two competing interurban companies over possession of a
                    right-of-way took place in the city of 
                        Crawfordsville
                     and on the 
                        Lafayette
                     pike near Zionsville. State and federal court suits were energetically contested and
                    even street brawls were not unheard of.
            Among the first promoters of a line northwest from indianapolis were Frederick Ayres, William M.
                    Taylor and John F. Carson, a lawyer of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , who selected a route along the 
                        Crawfordsville
                        Pike
                    . The next year, 1901, nine 
                        Frankfort
                     men headed by David F. Allen incorporated a company for the purpose of obtaining
                    franchises through the counties of 
                  Marion, Hamilton, Boone
                and
                    Clinton to 
                        Frankfort
                    . In November of the preceding year A. O. McCain, Ernest Dawson, William and Alfred
                    Glossbrenner, president of Levy Printing company, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and J. S. Holiday, began securing franchises and right-of-ways along the 
                        Lafayette
                     pike. February 22, 1901, the promoters incorporated the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & 
                        Lebanon
                     Traction company ($400,000).1
            
            The company decided to build as far as 
                        Frankfort
                     and obtained the necessary franchises.2 The towns of Traders Point
                    and Royalton offered liberal stock subscriptions in return for building the railway along the 
                        Lafayette
                     pike; while Zionsville

                     1The following were directors: William Helfenbeger, Jacquilin S.
                            Holiday, Eli P. Baker, 
                                Caldwell
                             N. Glossbrenner, W. J. Goodall and L. S. Woodbridge, 
                                Indianapolis
                            ; William J. DeVol and Samuel H. Ralston, afterward governor of Indiana, 
                                Lebanon
                            .

                     and Whitestown offered stock subscriptions and a generous
                    subsidy.3 The latter route was chosen.
            A few months later George Townsend and William S. Reed, who had purchased interests in the line,
                    reorganized the company, calling it the 
                  Indianapolis, Lebanon
                & 
                        Frankfort
                     Traction company.4
            
            A few months after the incorporation of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & 
                        Lebanon
                     Traction company, a rival group of railway builders organized the 
                        Lafayette
                     & 
                        Indianapolis
                     Rapid Transit Railway company ($25,000).5 The route was
                    to parallel the Big Four railroad from Stockwell into 
                        Indianapolis
                    . One hundred and five condemnation suits were instituted to appropriate parts of the
                        right-of-way.6 Some franchises were obtained but a serious legal battle with
                    the 
                  Indianapolis, Lebanon
                & 
                        Frankfort
                     Traction company over that part of the route which lay between 
                        Lebanon
                     and the 
                        Marion county
                     line and another part of the proposed roadway near 
                        Crawfordsville
                     ended unfavorably and the promoters were compelled to abandon the plan.7
            
            A short time after their successful outcome of the right-of-way contest Townsend and Reed, who had
                    been engaged in ballasting the track of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & 
                        Shelbyville
                     Traction company, began work on the 
                        Indianapolis
                    -
                        Lafayette
                     line. A $200,000 power plant was constructed at 
                        Lebanon
                    . Some surveys were made for a contemplated extension of the line to 
                        Chicago
                     but nothing was ever done.
            December 17, 1902, the company had changed its name to 
                        Indianapolis
                     and Northwestern Traction company and raised its capital stock from $25,000
                    to $2,500,000; the following

                     7The L. & I. Rapid Transit Ry. Co. claimed that, after they

                            begun construction. Eight miles of roadway had been graded.

                     brought federal suit and injunction proceedings to restrain the traction company from
                    turning on the current in the trolley wires, declaring that it would damage their circuits. The
                    court finally permitted the current to be turned on.9 A city car was borrowed
                    from the 
                        Indianapolis
                     City Railway company and a trial trip was made September 5, 1903.
            In May, 1905, a curious situation arose in railroad circles. The steam lines from 
                        Indianapolis
                     to 
                        Chicago
                     had all agreed to run no excursions to 
                        Chicago
                     that summer. The Monon Railroad advertised in 
                        Indianapolis
                     for an excursion from 
                        Lafayette
                     to 
                        Chicago
                     in cooperation with the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Northwestern Traction company. The excursion was run in spite of the protests
                    and threats of the steam lines.10 The entire following summer a similar
                    arrangement was made with the Cloverleaf at 
                        Frankfort
                     to run to 
                  Detroit, Toledo
                and 
                        St. Louis

            April 1, 1907, the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Northwestern Traction company was leased by the 
                  Terre Haute, Indianapolis
                & Eastern Traction company for a period of 999 years,
                    the lessee to pay taxes, bond interest, preferred dividends, maintain property and pay
                    $500 annually for upkeep of organization.12
            
            There were rumors in the spring of 1906 concerning a line to be built from 
                        Lafayette
                     to 
                        Williamsport
                     and 
                        Danville
                    , Illinios.13 In the same year some Montmorenci and Otterbein
                    citizens promoted a line west from 
                        Lafayette
                     to 
                        Bloomington
                     or 
                  Danville, Illinois
               , and incorporated August 1, 1906, the 
                        Lafayette

                    Some franchises were obtained and two bonding

                     a terminus, for which purpose the principal stockholders of the Traction company
                    organized the Consolidated Traction company, and included in the directorate some of the
                    stockholders of the old

                        Indianapolis
                     & Northwestern Traction company, for the ownership of the right-of-way between

                     and 
                        Lebanon
                    . The Consolidated inherited all the animosities of its various constituents. The
                    struggle with Townsend and Reed was resumed, the dispute being over the possession of a city
                    franchise in 
                        Crawfordsville
                    . The city would grant but one franchise, and this franchise was eagerly sought by both
                    companies because each wished to control the line that the other must be compelled to use.
            The city council voted to grant the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Northwestern Traction company the right to use Main street and almost at once
                    revoked the privileges notwithstanding the company had deposited the necessary bond. The company
                    began to lay track on Main street;19 the city thereupon brought

            After failing in their effort to build the Consolidated Traction company line,20
                    the promoters organized September 19, 1905, the

                    & Western Traction company for the purpose of building a direct line to 
                        Crawfordsville

                    in June the contract was awarded to the Moore-Mansfield Construction company. The power plant was
                    erected at

                    ; July 7, 1907, the work was completed and regular service began.22
            
            In August, 1907, the Moore-Mansfield Construction company filed a complaint in 
                        Marion County
                     circuit court against the interurban company and the trustees of the bonds, asking for

                    cross bill to establish the merits of the lien decided that the construction company was not a
                    privileged creditor. At the same time, upon petition of several creditors, the court ordered the
                    sale of the road.26 April 6, 1912, the properties of the 
                  Indianapolis, Crawfordsville

                    price of $1,000,000 to Joseph T. Elliott & Sons, bond dealers of 
                        Indianapolis
                    .27 The unredeemed bonds were then bought up at 66 2/3 cents on the
                    dollar. The road-bed was in good condition because a large part of the earnings during management by
                    the receiver was expended on improvements.28

                    raised to two million dollars, of which $750,000 was 5% preferred stock; and July 28,
                    thirty gangs of graders began work on the 
                        Greencastle

                    pushed the construction to completion.39 There was delay in securing material
                    and labor, so that it was September 1, 1905 before a regular schedule was inaugurated.40 The line is now operated as a division of The

                    During the spring of 1912, Bainbridge offered a bonus of $6,000 and other towns a total

            The citizens of Dana, Clinton and Farm Ridge met June 16, 1902 with the Commercial Club of 
                        Terre Haute
                     to discuss a line north from 
                        Terre Haute
                     to 
                  Danville, Illinois

                        Terre Haute
                     Electrical company, afterwards known as 
                        Terre Haute
                     Traction & Light company, obtained franchises and in the spring of 1903 began
                    active work. In November of the same year the line was opened to traffic.42 The
                    company has since found itself unable to build the line beyond Clinton. In October, 1907, the
                    residents along the route that had been outlined in the franchise considered the construction of the
                    extension themselves but the panic of 1907 defeated their plans.
            Another luckless attempt to extend the line was that of five 
                        Indianapolis
                     men, who incorporated the

                     Traction company ($25,000) June 12, 1912 for the purpose of building a line
                    to connect Clinton with the 
                        Illinois
                     system at

                & Eastern Traction company, the lessee of the
                    Sullivan line, proposed a six mile spur from 
                        Shelburn
                     to Hymera; an extension to Linton was also considered; but most of all, the company
                    desired that the line be extended to 
                        Vincennes
                     and southward to meet the Murdock line which ran from 
                        Evansville
                     to Patoka. Because of inability to finance the project the gap has never been closed.

                        Indianapolis
                     present a contrast in their origin. The Union Traction company of Indiana owns most of
                    its lines; the 
                  Terre Haute, Indianapolis
                & Eastern Traction company leases a large
                    part of its lines. The former, a pioneer in the field, added to its mileage by merging all lines it
                    built or acquired by purchase; the latter came into being ten years after most of the Indiana lines
                    were built, and brought its various divisions into the system by purchase or lease after an earlier
                    company had constructed them.49

                    company and construction started that year. In March, 1900, a strike occurred when twenty of the
                    laborers who had been paid $1.35 a day refused to work for less than $1.50 a
                    day. The foreman hired Italians to work in the places of the strikers and violence was feared for
                    several days.1

                    the town for the use of both companies. Each wanted to own the line. The 
                  Logansport, Rochester
                & Northern Traction company secured an injunction
                    against the Boyd line prohibiting them from building on High street. They then began laying track on
                    Erie avenue instead of High street and on Market street to Fourth street where the city lines were

            In February, 1911, the stockholders voted to refinance the corporation because of need of new funds
                    for enlarging shops and terminals and because of the many damage claims arising from the wreck at

            In the fall of 1902, a line was promoted by R. S. Vivian and 0. V. Darby between 
                        Kokomo
                     and

                        Kokomo
                     section." The following month the name of the company was changed to the
                            
                  Kokomo, Marion
                & Western Traction company and the capital stock was

                & Western Traction company, surrendered its capital stock and
                    merged with the

                & Western Traction company, the one million dollar capital
                    stock of the latter company was converted into shares of the same value in the name of the new
                            
                  Kokomo, Marion
                & Western Traction company.
            About the same time a rival line was being promoted by C. H. Bundy and J. E. Clark, who, it was
                    claimed, were to be supported by Union Traction interests. Franchises were obtained, but were
                    allowed to lapse.

                    capitalists. The city lines of 
                        Kokomo
                     were owned by the stockholders of the traction company and afforded a ready entrance
                    into the city. The 
                        Kokomo
                    -Greentown section began operations in the fall of 1903 and the entire line two years

            The History of Spiritualism In Indiana
            Anna Stockinger, 
                        Versailles
                    
            
            All through the ages man has groped for an answer to the question: "If a man die, shall he
                    live again?" While the human race as a whole never quite believed death to be
                    the termination of human existence, faith always had to be exerted. Spiritualism has now come,
                    offering to fortify faith with knowledge.
            In this age of scientific investigation and enlightenment, it is imperative that we learn what
                    Spiritualism is, what it means, and what its mission. We cannot afford to neglect a subject that is
                    of such vital importance. Nor can we profit in our undertakings if we allow the doors of prejudice
                    to close the avenue of knowledge.
            The phenomena of Spiritualism were known to the ancient world. The literature of 
                  India, Egypt
                and 
                        China
                     is permeated with spiritual truths. Mediaeval Spiritualism made its mark through Jesus,
                    the healer. This chain of spirit influence has continued unbroken; the rise and fall of nations have
                    not obliterated the phenomena from human existence.
            Spiritualism is defined as the belief in the continuity of life after death, and its continual
                    progress, and the application of this belief to the right conduct of living. Modern Spiritualism
                    stands for the supremacy of law in the realm of spirit, as in the physical. The departed are near
                    and communicate with their earth friends, not by permission but by law.
            That modern Spiritualism is not a movement of mortals alone has been frequently declared by spirit
                    workers. That the so-called dead are an organized body systematically working for mortals is no
                    secret to the mediums doing their work. Maintaining the purpose of life to be for the growth and
                    progress of the soul and its ultimate perfection, spirit teachers strive to impress this fact upon
                    man while he is yet in the body. Through the phenomena of spirit return they hope to call attention
                    to the need of individual soul culture, and to instruct man through the philosophy of Spiritualism
                    as presented through their trained speakers.
            
            The key which unlocked the door of modern Spiritualism was discovered in 1848 by the Fox sisters of
                    Hydesville, 
                        New York
                    . Through the raps which came unheralded and unsought, to the Fox household, the girls,
                    Margaret and Kate, established a code of communication which proved that those called
                    "dead" could see and hear, and were seeking to prove their identity. That the
                    communicating intelligence had purpose, and determination to carry it out, was discovered when the
                    communication was rapped upon walls and furniture by the spirit Charles Rosna, who claimed he was
                    robbed of his peddler's pack, murdered, and his body buried in the cellar of the house.
                    These discoveries and their later verification naturally attracted widespread attention. Soon the
                    searchlight of intelligent investigation was turned upon the matter, revealing the truth that man
                    survives death, and that the fact is demonstrated through conditions operating under natural laws.
                    These revelations distinguish modern Spiritualism and place it on the list of scientific
                    discoveries.
            The spread of Spiritualism dates from 1850. At this early date the facts upon which Spiritualism is
                    based were known to be as follows: That man in the body is spirit as much as he ever will be; that
                    laws of the universe govern spirit; that through these laws communication between man in the body
                    and man out of the body is possible.
            The sons of Robert Owen, spiritualist, and head of the colony known as 
                        New Harmony
                    , in Indiana, were among the first to arouse an interest in Spiritualism in the state.
                    Many other unorganized but zealous workers, remaining true to their convictions in the face of
                    persecution, aided the movement. Among these were Julius A. Wayland, editor of the Coming Nation, of 
                        Greensburg
                    , Indiana, and later of the Appeal to Reason, of 
                        Kansas
                    ; Dr. Henry Stockinger, one of the first graduates of Indiana University, later a
                    student under Joseph Rodes Buchanan, professor of the 
                        Cincinnati
                     Eclectic Medical College, father of psychometry, author and spiritualist; Dr. H. V.
                    Sweringen, head of the Medical Association of Ft. 
                        Wayne
                    , lecturer and writer; Hon. A. B. 
                        Richmond
                    , of 
                        Switzerland county
                    , M. D. and lecturer, later 
                        United States
                     court attorney, author of books on legal questions; Mrs.  Henrietta Elliott, propagandist, 
                        North Vernon
                    ; Mrs. L. L. Lawrence, noted as first to establish free dress cutting and making schools
                    in 
                        Indianapolis
                     and other cities. With voice and pen Mrs. Lawrence announced the discoveries made by
                    her mother, "Grandma Davis" who became a remarkable medium at the age of eighty.
            The first state organization of Indiana Spiritualists was formed in 1862; Dr. Samuel Maxwell, of 
                        Richmond
                    , was its president. Twenty delegates represented the Indiana societies at the National
                    Spiritualist convention held at 
                        Chicago
                     in 1873.
            There are two state Spiritualist organizations in Indiana todayâ€”one dating from 1888,
                    known as the Indiana Association of Spiritualists, the other from 1904, known as the Indiana State
                    Association of Spiritualists. The latter is an auxiliary of the National Spiritualist Association
                    which directs the welfare of the 34 state organizations and has for its purpose the promotion of
                    religion and morality, the erection of suitable places of worship where spiritualism may be taught
                    and the education and license of proper persons as authorized lecturers or teachers of Spiritualism.
            The Indiana Association of Spiritualists held its first Convention at Anderson, in 1888. Its by-laws
                    and laws of incorporation were drawn by Dr. G. W. Hilligoss, Anderson; James Millspaugh and Carl
                    Bronenberg, Chesterfield; and filed by A. J. Davis, recorder, of 
                        Madison
                     county. The presiding speakers and mediums at the early meetings were Mrs. Colby
                    Luther, Charles Barnes, Dr. Horn, Dr. and Mrs. Hilligoss.
            The following committee was appointed to select a suitable site for a camp ground for Indiana
                    Spiritualists: D. A. Ralston, G. W. Bunting, J. G. Cook, John Shoemaker, all of 
                        Indianapolis
                    ; J. H. Bond, 
                  Greensboro; Warren
                Smith, 
                        Frankfort
                    ; H. Manahan, 
                        Crown Point
                    ; Isaac King, 
                        Williamsburg
                    ; Dr. Westerfield, Anderson; Wallace Hibbits, 
                        Muncie
                    ; A. B. Goodykunz, 
                        Jonesboro
                    ; James Best, Winchester; L. 0. Edson, 
                        Hartford
                     City. Upon their report, a 34-acre tract on the banks of White river at Chesterfield,
                    Indiana, was purchased of Carl Bronenberg.
            
            Of those who helped to prepare the camp ground for the first meeting in 1892, and who served
                    officially, were Carl and Henry Bronenberg, of Chesterfield; Thomas Bronenberg, Anderson; and John
                    Bronenberg, 
                        Versailles
                    , Indiana.
            There is now a Spiritualist camp in nearly every state in the union. Camp Chesterfield ranks as the
                    second largest, the one at Lily Dale, 
                        New York
                    , being largest. The charming location and modern equipment make the Indiana camp an
                    ideal retreat for thousands coming from every state in the union to investigate the phenomena of
                    Spiritualism in open light through certificated mediums, and to hear its philosophy explained by the
                    highest talent in the ranks.
            Camp Chesterfield holds its six-weeksâ€™ session annually, beginning in July, with an
                    average attendance of twenty thousand. Its officers for 1924 are Myron H. Post, Pres.; Mable Riffle,
                    Sec.; Susie 
                        Brown
                    , Treas., all of Anderson, and L. R. Bute, vice-pres., Pendleton, Indiana.
            The Indiana State Association of Spiritualists holds its annual conventions in June, in 
                        Indianapolis
                     where there are nine Spiritualist churches. It has a yearly increase of delegates from
                    its fifty or more churches and their Lyceums. The state officers are William Woodworth, Pres., 
                        Crawfordsville
                    ; Luther Huber, Vice-pres., 
                        Hammond
                    ; Mrs. Mattie Bolser, Sec., 
                        Richmond
                    , and Mrs. Velma Hool, Treas., 
                        South Bend
                    .
            The rapid growth of Spiritualism is unprecedented in the annals of any religious movement. Coming
                    into an epoch of practical activity and working toward universal education and brotherhood, churches
                    began to spring up in the early fifties. The first was built in 
                        Fountain county
                    , near Veedersburg, and meetings are still held there. The builders of this church
                    suffered for their convictions by the boycott of local merchants and grain dealers, being forced to
                    take their produce to the 
                        Lafayette
                     markets, fifty miles distant.
            In 1858, a church was built at 
                        Salem
                    , by "The Friends of Progress." Its first president was Jonathan
                    Swain. Dr. Samuel Maxwell of 
                        Richmond
                    , the first known public lecturer and message bearer, alternating with J. J. Gardner,
                    served the 
                        Salem
                     church regularly. These workers established a Spiritualist library and lyceum in 1865.
            
            The movement still grows. Today, Indiana with her fifty or more churches affiliated with the National
                    Spiritualist Organization, is one of over forty states so organized. The Indiana Association of
                    Spiritualists also has many churches and societies working under an independent state charter. The
                    average general attendance of all these churches and societies is now estimated at half a million.
            The origin and development of the First Spiritualist church of 
                        Versailles
                    , is typical. Thirty years ago, Mr. B. F. 
                        Spencer
                    , John B. Austin, and Dr. Jno. M. Sweezey engaged Mrs. R. S. Lilly, a medium of national
                    reputation, to deliver Spiritualist lectures in 
                        Versailles
                    . After Mrs. Lilly, the national missionaries, Rev, and Mrs. E. W. Sprague, presented
                    the philosophy and phenomena to 
                        Versailles
                     audiences. At Rev. Sprague's suggestion a society was organized and chartered
                    by the National Spiritualist Association under the name of "The Psychical Research
                    Society." Its membership was composed of prominent people, among whom were B. F. 
                        Spencer
                     and family, Dr. Olmsted and family, Dr. John M. Sweezey and wife, and Attorney Adam
                    Stockinger and family. A course of reading for spiritual education and development was followed,
                    private home circles were formed and a medium for public message work developed. The accumulated
                    experiences of this medium were later edited by Prof. James H. Hyslop in the Journal of the American
                    Psychical Research society of 1916. In 1921 the 
                        Versailles
                     society reorganized under charter of the Indiana State Association of Spiritualists and
                    the First Spiritualist church in southern Indiana was established, with Mrs. Eva M. Hunter,
                    president.
            The Rev. and Mrs. E. W. Sprague, working throughout Indiana thirty years ago, reported having
                    organized thirty-nine societies in the space of six months. These, like the 
                        Versailles
                     society, later became churches. Also they learned that many circles for the development
                    and education of mediums were being held in private homes. That this home circle work still prevails
                    in Indiana is evidenced by the book of Mrs. May Wright Sewell which contains a wonderful example of
                    healing in the privacy of her home.
            
            In past ages the mediaries between the spirit world and man were the seers, priests and prophets.
                    "Medium" is the word now used to designate such workers. The home circle is the
                    school where spirit teachers train mediums. While every one possesses some degree of mediumship, the
                    spirit teachers choose those certain to submit to years of training. If skeptical they become all
                    the better workers after being convinced of spirit return. In the circle, their spiritual faculties
                    are systematically quickened and exercised that they may serve as efficient tools for the receiving
                    and sending of information from the spirit world to man. In time they become message bearers and
                    speakers. They are then required by the state organizations to pass examination and become
                    certificated before engaging in public work. Those ordained as ministers are entitled to the rights
                    and privileges held by the clergy of other religions under the laws of Indiana.
            Many of these authorized workers were writers as well as mediums. They wrote many books which
                    contributed largely to the understanding of the subject. However, they are most popularly known and
                    loved for the messages they have delivered from the public platform. Through the public test message
                    from spirit loved ones, they brought consolation to the bereaved and proof of immortality to the
                    thousands who had disbelieved or whose faith had waned. Space permits mention of but few: Mrs. Colby

                    under the auspices of Spiritualism,â€”were prominent workers in Indiana. The public workers
                    of the present day are numerous.
            In expounding the philosophy of Spiritualism, these speakers teach the significance of life,
                    emphasizing individual responsibility and encouraging spiritual education and development.
            The following Declaration of Principles is published to the world, not as a creed binding on the
                    conscience of the  individual, but as the consensus of a very
                    large majority of American Spiritualists on the fundamental teachings of Spiritualism:
            
               1. We believe in Infinite Intelligence.
               2. We believe that the phenomena of nature, both physical and spiritual, are the expression of
                        Infinite Intelligence.
               3. We affirm that a correct understanding of such expression, and living in accordance
                        therewith, constitute true religion.
               4. We affirm that the existence and personal identity of the individual continue after the
                        change called death.
               5. We affirm that communication with the so-called dead is a fact scientifically proven by the
                        phenomena of Spiritualism.
               6. We believe that the highest morality is contained in the Golden Rule: "Whatsoever
                        ye would that others should do unto you, do ye also unto them."
               7. We affirm the moral responsibility of the individual, and that he makes his own happiness
                        or unhappiness as he obeys or disobeys Nature's physical and spiritual laws.
               8. We affirm that the doorway to reformation is never closed against any human soul, here or
                        hereafter.
            
            The literature of Spiritualism is abundant and has received wide attention. The books of Andrew
                    Jackson Davis circulated in Indiana in 1850. The volume, Nature's Divine
                        Revelations was noteworthy in that it contained the prophecy that Spiritualism would soon
                    become an established fact, which prophecy was fulfilled by the Fox sisters two years later. Other
                    books followed in quick succession. Most notable of these were from the pen of Robert Dale Owen,
                    member of congress and minister to Naples. Mr. Owen investigated spirit return through the Fox
                    sisters in 
                        New York
                    , and abroad with eminent men. In 1859, he made known the fact that the Spiritual
                    phenomena which had been observed for centuries were not to be dismissed by the easy term
                    "supernaturalism", but that they were occurrences under laws. The best
                    authenticated of the phenomena he published in Footfalls on the Boundary of Another
                        World. This and another book entitled 
                         The Debatable Land Between this World and the Next,
                    still find readers in Indiana.
            The books written in the early fifties by John W. Edmonds, judge of the supreme court of 
                        New York
                    , had even a deeper appeal than the scholarly Owen productions, because the
                    Judge's own mediumship made the subject clearer. The same is true of Rev. E. W. Sprague
                    whose books based on years of missionary experience throughout the nation convey with peculiar
                    clearness an understanding of the subject.
            A recent addition to the Spiritualist library is the book Neither Dead nor
                    Sleeping, by Mrs. May Wright Sewell, with introduction by Booth Tarkington. Mrs. Sewell, who
                    had attained national fame in educational lines, was ranked by 
                        Indianapolis
                     as one of her three most eminent citizens. She demonstrated the benefit of the home
                    circle, especially in the work of spirit healing. Her book is a complete record of the work of
                    healing by spirit physicians through mortal coâ€”operation.
            The periodicals from the Spiritualist press have also a wide circulation. The
                        Progressive Thinker and The National Spiritualist, both 
                        Chicago
                     publications, are the most popular of the many Spiritualist papers circulating in
                    Indiana.
            To all its adherents, Spiritualism has meant intellectual emancipation. Its workers, inspired with
                    the idea that unrestricted mental progress should be for every individual, devote themselves to the
                    task of carrying the message of spirit return to the world. Through the philosophy of Spiritualism,
                    which teaches of life here and hereafter, they touch on every subject that makes for improved
                    material conditions. The organized Spiritualists of Indiana are influential in all that is for the
                    good of mankind.
         
         
         
            Ripples of the Black Hawk War In Northern Indiana
            Ella Lonn, Laporte
            A whole nation makes pilgrimages to stand reverently at the foot of 
                        Plymouth
                     Rock and do obeisance to the spot which marks the beginnings of a nation. Of no less
                    importance and interest are the spots which mark the beginnings of the life of one of our states.
            Such a spot for Indiana and the 
                        Mississippi
                     Valley is to be found a few miles south-west of 
                        La Porte
                    , Indiana. A large granite boulder bears two bronze tablets, on one of which the
                    wayfarer may read the following bit of history:
            
                    On this spot a fort stockade was built to defend the lives of the pioneers of Laporte 
                            Prairie
                         from a threatened invasion by Black Hawk and his braves in the spring of 1S32.
                        Warning of the danger was brought by John Coleman who rode his Indian pony Musquog from Fort
                        Dear-born to this place in six hours.1
               
                
            The reader will recall that in 1832 there was a border war with the Indians of 
                        Illinois
                     which startled the settlers of Indiana and brought out the state militia, together with
                    a large body of volunteers. Black Hawk was a picturesque and tragical figure, but likewise a skilful
                    and cunning leader of a band of Sauk Indians who lived on the Rock river in western 
                        Illinois
                     where the Rock pours into the 
                        Mississippi
                    . The old warriors of his band were kindred spirits who had allied themselves with
                    Tecumseh2 in the War of 1812 and were notorious for their sympathy with the British, in recognition
                    of which fact they were known along the border as the British Band. The allied
                    Sauk and Fox Indians assented to and signed the treaty 
                  
                     1The other tablet bears the names of the builders of the fort. The
                            memorial was erected by the 
                                La Porte County
                             Historical Society and unveiled September 13, 1910.
                  
                     2Black Hawk with a band of two hundred Sauk had served with the
                            Shawneo chief until the death of the latter at the Battle of the Thames, October 5, 1813.
                            Black Hawk was near Tecumseh when the latter fell and kept up the border forays along the
                            upper 
                                Mississippi
                             until May 13, 1816, when the final peace treaty was signed with the 
                                United States
                            .
               
                     of November 3, 1804, whereby they ceded fifty million acres of
                    land to the government for one thousand dollars a year annuity. This stretch of land is identical
                    with what is today the eastern third of 
                        Missouri
                     and the land between the 
                        Wisconsin
                    , Fox, 
                        Illinois
                    , and 
                        Mississippi
                     rivers. The unfortunate Article Seven proved one of the chief causes of the Black Hawk
                    War, for it provided that "as long as the lands which are now ceded to the 
                        United States
                     remain their property (that is, public lands, not parceled out to settlers), the
                    Indians belonging to said tribes shall enjoy the privilege of living or hunting upon
                        them."3 Under this provision the Indians were protected against
                    immediate removal.
            The chief seat of the Sauk power was within the limits of the cession, a village situated three miles
                    above the mouth of the Rock river. This picturesque village, one of the largest Indian villages in
                    the 
                        United States
                    , was the home of about five hundred families, but, what was vastly more important,
                    contained the chief cemetery of the Sauks. The alluvial soil readily yielded enormous crops and here
                    was located one of the relatively few tracts where the Indians indulged in cultivation of the soil
                    and took pride in their seven hundred acres of maize. But when the government surveyors and settlers
                    began to drift in after 1823 and to flock in after 1830, Black Hawk, early a malcontent,4 jealous of
                    the constituted chiefs, sought excuses to oppose the policy of the wiser and more moderate leaders
                    among the Indians, and welded his followers

                     4He was born in a Sauk village in 1767. Though not born or elected a
                            chief, he was accepted as leader over his own band merely by common consent. It is rather
                            remarkable that though not of superior physical, moral, or intellectual ability, he made
                            himself a national figure, due probably to his restlessness and ambition, combined with some
                            of the qualities of leadership. It has been insisted that he was of a ton confiding
                            disposition. The invariable courtesy accorded him by the British agent on his annual visits
                            to Maiden, contrasted with the American treatment meted out to him, led him to depend upon
                            British aid. He also accepted at their face value the promises of White Cloud, a Winnebago
                            prophet, who deceived him as to the strength of Indian support. And he believed Neapope, his
                            second in command of the British Band, when the latter reported promises
                            of aid from the British, Winnebago, and Pottawattomi in any effort the Sauk might make to
                            regain their village. He possessed a peculiar poetical eloquence in haranging his followers
                            which made him almost the equal of Tecumseh In ability to arouse the Indian passions. For a
                            fuller analysis of this interesting character see R. G. Thwaites, Essays in
                                Western History. (

                     into a unit to oppose the former in council. A natural
                    demagogue, he easily aroused the passions of his followers and could ben them to his will.
                    Furthermore, he was easily swayed by the British military and commercial agents, who had been
                    steadily engaged in stirring up the northwestern tribes against the 
                        United States
                     from 1776 until 1813, and he placed great reliance on the promised protection of his
                    British father, the military agent at Maiden in 
                        Canada
                    .
            After he had seen the Sauk fields cultivated for half a century, it is easy to appreciate the anger
                    and despair with which he viewed in the spring of 1830 and again 1831, upon his return from an
                    unsuccessful winter's hunt across the 
                        Mississippi
                    , his village in ruins, lodges burned, fields of corn preempted by the whites, even the
                    graves of his ancestors defiled; it is easy to appreciate with what rage he heard tales of squaws
                    and children being whipped for going beyond the bounds drawn by the whites. When remonstrances
                    proved futile, and when in 1831 he was even warned away by the settlers, he notified the intruders
                    in a firm and dignified manner to leave, with the threat of the use of force, if necessary.5 Governor John Reynolds, of 
                        Illinois
                    , besieged with petitions which grossly exaggerated the situation, sent out a
                    proclamation calling for a volunteer force to "repel the invasion of the British
                    Band." A demonstration by a large body of volunteers thus called out, and by ten companies
                    of 
                        United States
                     regulars before Black Hawk's village on June 25, 1831, led the Indians that
                    night quietly to remove to the west banks of the 
                        Mississippi
                     whither they had been previously ordered. Five days later they signed a treaty in which
                    they bound themselves not to return to the east side of the river except by express permission of
                    the government. The Indians suffered during the rest of the year for the necessities of life, as it
                    was too late to plant another crop of corn or beans. When he made his usual visit to the commander
                    at Maiden, his vanity was fed, his bitterness against the 
                        United States
                     encouraged, and bad advice presumably given with the result that in the 
                  
                     5He insisted later in his autobiography that he meant physical force,
                            not bloodshed. Autobiography, (

                     following year, 1832, he rallied his Sauk and Fox tribes for
                    open war.6
            
            The kindling of war was the more easy because a general unrest had prevailed among the Indians of the
                    border for a year or more. Early in the summer of 1831 a group of Miami had killed a war chief of
                    the Potawatomi, with the inevitable result of threatened war, averted only by the efforts of General
                    William Marshall, a government agent. Also in 1830 a party of Menominee and Sioux had murdered some
                    of the British Band, whereupon Black Hawk, to preserve the honor of his tribe, felt obliged a few
                    weeks after the removal west of the 
                        Mississippi
                     to lead a party of Sauk up the river and to massacre all but one of a band of
                    twenty-eight Menominee. When the Indian agent at 
                        Prairie
                     du Chien demanded the surrender of the Sauk murderers for trial, Black Hawk refused, as
                    the act was one of mere reprisal in his eyes.7 Conditions, moreover, with the
                    settlers in 
                        Illinois
                     were ripe for warfare with the Indians, as many elements in the white population saw
                    benefits to be derived from it.
            By the spring of 1832 Black Hawk was ready to move. He had spent the winter of 1831â€”2 on
                    the deserted site of Fort 
                        Madison
                     near the mouth of the Des Moines river recruiting his band against the urgent protests
                    of the more level-headed chief, Keokuk. On April 8 he crossed the 
                        Mississippi
                     into 
                        Illinois
                     at Yellow Banks with a warlike band of five hundred braves, chiefly Sauk, accompanied
                    by their squaws and children. After sending to the Potawatomi an invitation to meet him in a council
                    of war on Sycamore creek, he proceeded up the valley of the Rock river, awakening the greatest fear
                    and consternation among the white inhabitants and causing them to flee wildly. Only the hot heads
                    among the Potawatomi consented to take the war-path, while the chief, Shaubena, himself carried
                    warning of the danger through the settlements in 
                        Illinois
                     and the Rock valley, even as far as

                     Hawk, although warned at once by General Atkinson8 to withdraw
                    west of the 
                        Mississippi
                    , replied defiantly and continued his march up the river until May 14 when he
                    unexpectedly came across Major Isaiah Stillman with nearly three hundred 
                        Illinois
                     volunteers, who had secured a reluctant permission from Brigadier-General Whiteside,
                    who was an experienced Indian fighter, to press on alone as a scouting party.9
                    Stillman gave Black Hawk just provocation for retaliation by failure to observe the most ordinary
                    rules of war, seizing three Indians whom their leader had sent with a flag of truce, as the latter
                    had by this time become convinced of the futility of the war, and killing two of the five braves
                    sent to observe the outcome of the effort for peace. As could be expected, Black Hawk struck with
                    savage fury and simply overwhelmed Major Stillman and his forces, who took to their heels in an
                    ignominious flight, an act of cowardice which later conduct did not redeem. Some continued their
                    flight for forty miles to Dixon, spreading wild and terrifying reports of the ferocity and strength
                    of Black Hawk's forces.
            Governor Reynolds, who had, in 1831, interpreted Black Hawk's warning and threat of the use
                    of force as a declaration of war, had on April 16, 1832, sent out a call for a special levy of
                    mounted volunteers, called out the state militia, and notified the inhabitants that the Sauk and
                    Potawatomi were on the war-path.
            Governor Reynolds referred only to the prairie Indians of 
                        Illinois
                    , but the settlers of Indiana, scattered and already rendered uneasy by various
                    circumstances, interpreted the warning to mean the Potawatomi of their own state. The story of
                    Stillman's defeat marked the beginning of a reign of terror from the 
                        Mississippi
                     to the 
                        Wabash
                     and to Lake 
                        Michigan
                     â€” 
                  
                     8General Atkinson was soon busy at Fort Armstrong, as he was a man of
                            executive ability with much military skill, courage and perseverance, and knowledge of
                            Indian character. His first move was to make sure of the fidelity of the Sauk and Foxes.
                  There were about two hundred and seventy-five men in this party. They were reckless
                            frontiersmen, impatient at the slow advance of the army, and anxious to cover themselves
                            with glory. On May 14 they went into camp in a small copse of open timber three miles
                            south-west of the mouth of the Sycamore creek, surrounded by clear prairie in a position
                            which was entirely easy of defense.
               
                     indeed, throughout the entire border. In a few days the region
                    was rife with rumors, serious enough at best to give grave cause for anxiety, but rendered appalling
                    by the gross exaggerations with which they became embellished. News came that men had been murdered
                    on Hickory creek; that all the settlements of that section had been abandoned and that the people
                    were pushing with the utmost speed to the 
                        Wabash
                    ; that not a person was left in the outlying sections; that the whole frontier was
                    aflame; that Black Hawk was sparing neither man, woman, nor child; and that hostile Indians had
                    already reached Fort 
                        Dearborn
                    . The poor new settlers expected momentarily to hear the warhoop of the red man and to
                    see the gleam of his tomahawk. Shaubena and his friends again rode through the settlements with the
                    word of warning.
            Black Hawk was pursued by the 
                        Illinois
                     volunteers and by 
                        United States
                     regulars, as is well known, under Colonel Zachary Taylor;10
                    additional regulars were hurried west from the seaboard under General Winfield Scott;11 and the misguided savages were defeated and utterly crushed at Bad Axe on August 2,
                    only about one hundred and fifty of the entire body of a thousand making good their escape across
                    the 
                        Mississippi
                    . Black Hawk himself was taken prisoner and imprisoned for some time in Fortress 
                        Monroe
                     until he was consigned to a worse fateâ€”released into the custody of his
                    chief rival, Keokuk.12
            
            
               
                  10All writers seem to feel moved to call attention to the fact that at
                        least four men served in this war who later attained national distinction : Captain Abraham
                        Lincoln and Lieutenant Jefferson Davis, besides the two named in the text. The writer duly
                        discharges her apparent duty in repeating these facts.
               
                  11It will be of passing interest to hear the story of Mrs. G. L. Andrew, a
                        pioneer still living in 
                            La Porte
                        , concerning these same government troops. On September 23, 1832, the first Sunday
                        after her arrival in 
                            La Porte
                         county as a little girl of eight, her parents were urged to go on a knoll several
                        rods above their newly erected cabin to look out over the prairie. She saw from this height a
                        long train of forty white canvass-covered wagons slowly following the only trail east. It was
                        the soldiers with their tents returning from the campaign in Tlinois. On the personal testimony
                        of Mrs. Andrew.

            But however remote was the real danger to Indiana settlers, the danger seemed very near and real and
                    marks the nearest approach to warfare that the northern portion of that state has ever known. There
                    were in 1832 very few families in any portion of this northern country and those few were widely
                    scattered. Individuals had already had warning that the Sauk were in an ugly mood. The settlers of
                    New Durham township, now a part of 
                        La Porte
                     county,13 had been told by the 
                        Ottawa
                     and Potawatomi that "as soon as the leaves on the trees became as large as
                    squirrelsâ€™ ears" it was the intention of the Sauk to invade the settlement and
                    to murder the inhabitants.14
            
            Another bit of evidence of their surly mood is evidenced by C. W. Cathcart, a pioneer of 
                        La Porte
                     county. Early in 1832 a large band of Sauk braves had crossed his land on their way to 
                        Canada
                    . An old chief, a giant in stature, jostled him rudely from the path, while several
                    others lifted the cover of their rifle locks to warn him that the priming was dry. He happened to
                    encounter them again at the cabin of a family named Nichols, six miles east of 
                        La Porte
                    , as they made the return journey some weeks laterâ€”their last through the
                    county. When the indians boisterously demanded that Mrs. Nichols give them whiskey and she refused,
                    some of the braves got switches and ordered Cathcart to whip her into submission. When he refused,
                    they turned upon him and hustled him about rudely and violently until he was able to quiet them by
                    virtue of his knowledge of Spanish.15
            
            In May the Indian agent at Fort 
                        Dearborn
                     sent word to Arba Heald, one of the settlers at Door Village, in what was to be 
                        La Porte
                     county, by John Coleman, who covered the 
                  
                     13The famous Sauk trail passed through this township.
                  
                     14The writer is aware, of course, that this expression had been used
                            by the Indians in connection with the threat of the Potawatomi against the Miami for the
                            death of their war chief. See Logan Esary, History of Indiana (

                            Reminiscences, a manuscript of unusual merit and interest in the possession of his
                            daughter, Mrs. Andrew Johnson (Jane Cathcart Johnson). The Sauk Indians were under the
                            government of the Spaniards at 
                                St. Louis
                             until 1803 and so many of them still remembered their Spanish
                            "fathers" with affection.
               
                     seventy miles which separated the two points in the almost
                    incredibly short space of time of six hours by pony, some of it along the shore of Lake 
                        Michigan
                    , that the Indians had begun hostilities in 
                        Illinois
                     and advised the settlers to repel invasion. The messenger called out the warning at the
                    cabins along the Sauk trail as he passed,16 and Heald sent out word over the
                    prairie in this particular portion of 
                        La Porte
                     county. A large number of men assembled, hurrying into the Door 
                        Prairie
                     all night. The following morning a meeting was called to consult as to the best means
                    of defense, but some confusion arose, a stampede ensued with the natural result that about half of
                    the little company started east with their teams, some never stopping their flight until they
                    reached 
                        Cincinnati
                    . Many did not recover sufficiently from their fright to return until the next year,
                    some not at all.
            Forty-two men, however, remained and erected a fort, one hundred and twenty-five feet square,
                    consisting of a ditch, earthworks, and a palisade, on the southern edge of a small pond which is now
                    entirely dried up, a site admirably chosen for the purpose. It was a stockade of tall posts driven
                    into the ground, the timber secured from a thick grove of wild cherry and quaking aspen just west of
                    the pond. Upon two of the angles, diagonally opposite each other, were built blockhouses with
                    portholes for rifles commanding the sides. A ditch surrounded the whole. A well was sunk in the
                    center and the depression of that old well is still visible.17 The fort was

                     16Mrs. G. L. Andrew relates how she often heard as a child the tale of
                            the warning shouted to her uncle, whose cabin stood on the trail. In response to a loud
                            halloo, the uncle opened the door to hear young Coleman shout, "The Indians are
                            killing the whites on the Fay and

                            Andrew. It will be observed that the settlers in 
                                La Porte
                             chose to defend tnemselves hereâ€”except those who fled east, judging
                            discretion the better part of valor.
                  
                     17Tradition still points out the rotted stump of a pin-oak post as
                            marking the southeast corner of the fort, but Mr. Robert White, who took part in the
                            building of the fort as a boy of fifteen, declared in 1906 that no oak was used in its
                            structure. Stated in a manuscript by R. B. Oglesbee, A Little Journey in Scipio.

                    defense, which offered the occupants comparative safety.18
            
            Soon after the fort was finished, two block-houses were built as additional measures of safety, one
                    about a mile northwest of the first block-house at Door Village, and the other in New Durham
                    township between the old Sauk trail and New Durham village.19
            
            General Joseph Orr, who had purchased land in 
                        La Porte
                     county near the site of the chief stockade the year preceding, was present at the
                    building of the fort and stampede, and accordingly by virtue of his rank20 took
                    it upon himself to render a report to the governor, and then went to 
                        Chicago
                     to verify the rumors of danger. After an interview with Major Whistler, the commander
                    at Fort 
                        Dearborn
                    , he made some recommendations to Governor Ray at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and repaired to the headquarters of General Atkinson. He was promptly ordered to
                    organize a company of volunteer mounted rangers for three months to be employed along the western
                    frontier in order especially, to keep open communication between the 
                        Wabash
                     settlements and 
                        Chicago
                    .21 General Orr accordingly raised a company of eighty-eight men, armed with rifles,
                    tomahawks, and butcher knives. He submitted reports to General Winfield Scott, who was being held at 
                        Chicago
                     with his large force of the regular army by an outbreak of cholera. His volunteers
                    rendezvoused at Attica on July 2, and marched then to Hubbard's trading post on the
                    Iroquois river. Leaving an observation corps of fourteen men at this point, he marched the rest of
                    the company to the Kankakee river, which he reached July 7. Here he detached a small body to make a

                            it has remained scarcely more than a memory among the older settlers of the neighborhood.

                             Road sections, belonged to and was occupied by the original Indian owners, who
                            were favorable to the white advance. Mss. of R. B. Oglesbee, A Little Journey

                     five or six-day tour to Door 
                        Prairie
                     via the Kankakee and Iroquois rivers. Scott expected to march against Black Hawk July
                    26 and wanted General Orr to be ready for the movement.22 But Orr's
                    company was disbanded soon after August 6, shortly after the decisive defeat of Bad Axe.
            In contrast with the cowardice of Stillman's 
                        Illinois
                     volunteers, it is pleasing to note the sterling manhood of several of the defenders of
                    the stockade at Door 
                        Prairie
                    . The resolute spirit which animated them was shown when Peter White remarked,
                    "Me and my two boys make five." Mrs. Heald manifested the same spirit by refusing
                    to go into the stockade, and by barricading herself in her own cabin not far from the fort,
                    declaring that she would kill six Indians before they got possession of her home.23 Daniel Jessup returned with his ox-team at nightfall to his own home with the remark that
                    "he guessed he didn't need to be more afraid of the Indians than they were of
                        him."24 Henry Clyburn was of the same cool spirit. The liking of
                    the Indians for him and the influence he wielded with them left him quite unafraid so that when the
                    regular mail carrier arrived in 
                        La Porte
                     county on his bobtailed horse on his way to Ft. 
                        Dearborn
                    , blanched with fear over the bloody work in 
                        Illinois
                    , Henry Clyburn exchanged work with him. He feared one place only, the ford of the
                    Calumet river which he must cross in the dark over a narrow bridge with deep waters on each side.25
            
            Some episodes have only the merit of being amusing. In the confusion of the first alarm, a man named
                    McCarty, 
                  
                     22Much correspondence passed between Generals Orr and Scott. See
                            Packard, pp. 54â€”9. Scott's letter to Orr of July 20 shows clearly the
                            state of apprehension and insecurity of even military minds: "General Atkinson, on
                            the seventeenth, was preparing to march again upon the enemy with some hope of bringing him
                            to action about the twenty-first. If the Black Hawk succeed in avoiding a battle he may
                            retreat from Milwalky along the lake 
                                Michigan
                             in this direction. In that event we might meet him, and though our force would
                            be small, we might, nevertheless, effect something." Packard, pp. 57â€”8.
                            Orr led the troops to the lake shore six miles from 
                                Chicago
                             to lessen the tedium of the camp.

                            , 24. Even some of the pioneers who had chanced to be absent from 
                                La Porte
                             county when the wave of terror reached them, had a chance to have some part in
                            it. C. W. Catheart is a case in point. He was in Niles, 
                                Michigan
                            , and took a load of ammunition from that place through 
                                La Porte county
                             along the lake to 
                                Fort Dearborn
                            .
               
                     fearful that the Indians might capture his wife, hid her in the
                    tall grass with strict admonitions not to move until his return. But he failed to mark the spot and
                    in his bewilderment he hunted three days before she could be relieved of her cramped position. A
                    Mrs. Thomas, after working all night to pack her scanty household belongings, stubbornly refused to
                    budge when her husband declined to make room for her spinning-wheel, and calmly began to unpack the
                    household goods.26
            
            There are indications of no less than three stockades begun in different parts of 
                        St. Joseph county
                    , which adjoins 
                        La Porte county
                     on the east. Runners came, panting that the Indians had risen, and the dismayed
                    settlers fled from Portage prairie to Terre Coupee prairie, where a large number of them congregated
                    in the cabin of a settler until the excitement subsided. Another alarm sent the settlers scurrying
                    again to the same prairie, about forty taking refuge in a school-house where they spent the night.
                    The sight of a company of soldiers moving westward on a reconnaisance the next day restored courage
                    so that many returned home in the rear of the command. There is some reason to believe that a
                    stockade was erected near 
                        Hamilton
                     on this prairie,27 a second near 
                        Mt. Pleasant
                     on Portage prairie, and the third in 
                        South Bend
                    .
            Almost the first intimation of the Indian outbreak came to the little community settled at the south
                    bend of the 
                        St. Joseph
                     river,28 which has since grown into the considerable city of 
                        South Bend
                    , from the fugitives from the west, many so frightened that they hastened through
                    without even stopping to

                     27There is some confusion as to whether a block-house was actually
                            built on Terre Coupee prairie or not, which the writer has been unable to clear up. Howard

                             in the early months of 1832 and stopped in an Indian wigwam with a tribe
                            friendly to Black Hawk. When he learned of the war, he ran one hundred and sixty miles, the
                            trip rendered more difficult by a broken arm. When he reached the Kankakee marsh, he
                            realized he had not the strength to go around it and so he boldly made his way through it in
                            the night, probably the first white man to do so. His run cost him his life and was

                    Members of the new community especially the newcomers who were unfamiliar with frontier life, were
                    infected in their turn with the mania of fear. As 
                        South Bend
                     understood that it was to be occupied by a military force of some sort, that village
                    regarded itself as a first line of defense against any surprise attack. Notices of the disturbance

                            Kickapoo tribes, are not far distant from that place apparently with hostile intentions, and
                            that they have committed some depredations on the

                        been used as a tavern. The only files for 1831â€”2 in existenceâ€”and they

                            Detroit

                        Territory is menaced by
            
            
            Colonel Hiram 
                        Dayton
                     organized a company of volunteers in the village, drilled them,32
                    and then dismissed them to meet again upon one minute's notice, whence their pseudonym of
                    minute men.
            But a considerable number of the villagers insisted on the necessity of a fort, and so the triangular
                    piece of ground just west of the present standpipe on the Lincoln Highway was selected for the
                    location, even though some fears were voiced that the Indians might conceal themselves in the brush
                    under the hill and pick off the picket guard at night. And here a three-cornered fort was begun. The
                    ground was to be inclosed by a wall of timbers of split logs or puncheons to be sunk in the ground
                    three feet deep, rising nine or ten feet above ground in order to prevent the Indians from looking
                    over to spy out the weakness of the defense. The wall was to be pierced at intervals with
                    port-holes. The work was begun in a fever of excitement; the settlers egged each other on with the
                    wildest of tales, while, when other stories failed, some insisted on the secret hostility of the
                    Indians of the locality.33 After a time, as the inhabitants began to recover
                    their balance, and as the federal government gave evidence of activity, the work began to lag.
                    However, to quiet all apprehension, the village sent out a reconnaisance party of its own people,
                    which after a sixty or seventy mile ride west reported 
                  hostile bands of Indians in arms against the 
                                United States

                            and barbarous invaders. The constituted authorities of the Territory have summoned and the

                            their immediate services, to defend the frontier settlements and the Territory. Quoted in
                            the issue of June 6. But while the early issues after the outbreak of war carried a goodly
                            number of excerpts and dispatches, we are very far from sensational journalism.
                  
                     32A good story is told of the guard at this time. One old frontiersman
                            who valued the reports and excitement at their proper worth had been placed on night guard
                            duty. When the night began to wane, he rested his gun against a tree and went comfortably to
                            sleep. The officer in charge was properly appalled and indignant when he caught the old
                            rascal snoring, but the officers soon found themselves so perplexed by questions of proper
                            procedure in a court martial that they preferred to let a culprit escape punishment rather
                            than to murder a man without due process of law. T. E. Howard, History of 
                                    St. Joseph County

                     33Stanfield tells a story of how, while the fort was being erected, at
                            Potawatomi sauntered by, looking through the cracks between the puncheons. He was promptly
                            suspected as a spy whose summary arrest and death was demanded. Howard, pp.

                     on their return to the people collected in front of
                    Johnson's tavern their conviction that there was not a hostile Indian within one hundred
                    and fifty miles and that Pokagon the local chief of the Potawatomi, was clearly friendly, citing as
                    proof the fact that he had the American flag flying over his cabin.34
            
            The ripples of the storm did not expend themselves in 
                        South Bend
                    , but spread on east to 
                        Elkhart
                     county. Despite the best efforts of the level-headed, sane men, to allay the
                    excitement, it proved no time for clear reasoning. People mustered into the service of a Colonel
                    Jackson, prepared to march to the defense of Niles, which nearby point in 
                        Michigan
                     was reported to be threatened.
            A dog-feast, or thirst dance, then in progress in the Sauk village near Niles, did
                    not contribute to allay the fears of the 
                  
                     34An amusing episode which occurred at 
                                South Bend
                             reveals something of the farcial character of the war gestures in Indiana. The
                            governor of the State had called out a battalion of three hundred cavalry, the pick of 
                                Marion
                            , Johnson, and Hendricks counties, and started them for the front, though their
                            nearest approach was not more than a hundred miles within the scene of action. While they
                            were dallying between 
                                Lafayette
                             and 
                                Chicago
                            , the editor of the 
                                St. Joseph
                             Beacon, scarcely expecting them to return via 
                                South Bend
                            , called them a "holiday" battalion and made a number of
                            disparaging remarks. But on their return they came around the south bend of Lake 
                                Michigan
                            , and via 
                                St. Joseph county
                            , and to duly punish the author of such defaming, threatened to kill the editor
                            and put his press in the river. The editor's own account of the attack upon him
                            makes interesting reading:
                  On the day previous to their arrival, our paper was issued, containing an editorial
                            article which, from its "home thrusts", set too heavy on the feelings of some of the officers of said regiment. * * * In speaking of the
                            troops, I do not wish to be understood to mean all, for there were some honorable
                                exceptions-some who had too much honor to countenance the procedure. A
                            short time after their arrival in town, I was surrounded in the street by this military mob,
                            who, marching up to me with more than Spartan courage, said they intended revenging
                            themselves on me for having insinuated that they were on a money-making expedition, and were
                            destitute of the essential qualifications of soldiers, and by way of demonstrating that they
                            were men of genuine metal, many dirks and butcher knives leaped, with fearful clatter, from
                            their scabbards, and were flourished in dread array around me. Then they let slip a volley
                            of imprecations and abuse, which would have disgraced a mob of street scavengers, and it was
                            with much difficulty that the few officers who exerted themselves and several other
                            gentlemen who had influence with the rabble prevented them from wreaking their vengeance on
                            me in a bloody manner. After being kept in dures ci et armis for some time
                            I was liberated. * * *
                  Defrees did agree to insert in his next issue a statement to the effect that his remarks
                            were unmerited, but he nullified the effect by other caustic comments and criticisms of the
                            action of the officers in marching their men over a hundred miles through a country where
                            provisions were very scarce and in a direction where they were certain no danger existed.
                  I have discarded the account given by Howard, p. 715, in the light of this primary source
                            from the mouth of the chief actor.
               
                     whites. Indian bands had encamped for several weeks in
                    preparation for this festival, which was partly penitential, partly propitiatory. One requirement
                    was that the dancers should not eat, drink, or sleep during the entire feast, which covered a period
                    of from two to four days. The first step was the erection of a structure which did duty for a temple
                    to the accompaniment of much rude ceremony, the beating of tin pans and the recital of incantations
                    by the medicine men.35 Then followed dances for many long hours by young people,
                    both men and women, who had in a moment of vital danger vowed to render this service, to the music
                    of their own wild songs piped through a goose-bone whistle and to the beating of deer-skin drums.
                    This was followed, in its turn, by many exhibitions by the young bucks of their powers of
                        endurance,36 the whole finding its rather grewsome climax in the dog-feast,
                    when, because a dog's liver made the partaker strong-hearted, the warriors tore from a
                    dog's carcass his liver which each brave tasted while still warm.37
            
            As the hunters and travelers began to bring the tales of Black Hawk's outbreak to the
                    village of 
                        Elkhart
                    , scouts were sent in every direction. As elsewhere, people deserted their farms and
                    homes; some fled back to eastern settlements, while 
                  
                     35Led by a medicine-man, at this time usually in a ragged 
                                United States
                             military coat, his head surmounted by a mass of porcupine skin and swan
                            feathers, forty or fifty braves set forth on horseback for the woods to procure the
                            center-pole. They approached the tree selected with whoops and firing of guns, felled it and
                            drew it into camp where a few chosen men raised it into position to the accompaniment of
                            incantations. A circular tent was erected around the pole, about fifty feet in diameter,
                            with walls six feet high, the apex of the roof perhaps thirty feet from the ground, the
                            sides and roof composed of Buffalo skins. Inside four low compartments were made, two for
                            the male, and two for the female dancers.
                  
                     36A single illustration will suffice: A muscular warrior permitted a
                            couple of chiefs to thrust long skewers through the flesh of his shoulders, to the ends of
                            which were attached the reins of a horse. The candidate for honors was then told to lead the
                            animal around until the flesh gave way. With the blood streaming down over the paint of his
                            body, he strutted around for several hours without a murmur. Though the flesh upon his
                            shoulders tore toward the neck, it did not give way and the medicine-men with much ceremony
                            freed the victim and acclaimed another hero.

                  This work describes a sog-feast, which is clearly a misprint for dog-feast. The writer has

                     formed by the two branches of the 
                        St. Joseph
                     river, now known as Island Park, but the project was abandoned upon the assurance of
                    Chief Moran that the tribes would not revolt.39
            
            Meanwhile the 
                  
                            St. Joseph
                         Beacon was sending out its weekly issue, advising against alarm and flight.
                    Already on June 6 it was declaring the war over. In a few weeks the settlers knew there was no
                    genuine danger in northern Indiana.40
                    
                        The "Farce" is at an endâ€”the Indian mania has
                            subsidedâ€”all now are well assured that there is no danger, and wonder at
                            themselves that they were so much alarmed with so little cause. The Indian Agent at 
                                Chicago
                             seems to have been the principal agent in unnecessarily alarming the people
                            throughout the whole frontier borders. * * *
                        From all the correct information which we have been able to collect, we do not hesitate in
                            saying that there is not now, nor ever has been, any cause of fear in any other place than
                            in the neighborhood of Rock River. The prompt and decisive measures adopted by the Governor
                            of 
                                Illinois
                             and General Atkinson have been such as not to leave "a loop whereon to
                            hang a doubt" but that the few Indians who had determined to raise men in the
                            vicinity of 
                                Rock Island
                            , or so alarm the whites as to cause them to give up a year's
                            provisions, are, long before this, driven far beyond the 
                                Mississippi
                            , and scattered to the "four winds". We regret very much that
                            so many false rumors have been put into circulationâ€”not only on account of the
                            injury done some of our farmers who left their fields before putting in their corn crops,
                            but it may have a tendency to check the tide of emigration which had commenced flowing early
                            into this promising region. We insure persons at a distance, who are anxious to emigrate to
                            the

                             there is no dangerâ€”no more probability 
                        
                           38This fact was stated in a public address in 1858, made by

                            there is from the Emperor of Russia.41
                  
                    
            
            
               
                        Goshen
                    , about fifteen miles east of 
                        Elkhart
                     town, seems to mark the eastern limit of the waves of excitement in northern Indiana. A
                    letter seems to have been sent by an express rider first to Colonel John Jackson, presumably because
                    of the valiant part he had played in the War of 1812 under General Andrew Jackson, to the effect
                    that his Indians were near Niles, 
                        Michigan
                    , and urging him to call out the militia. That officer at once set forth to summon his
                    neighbors to bring guns and ammunition to 
                        Goshen
                     at eleven o'clock that same morning. One cool-headed neighbor, to whom we are
                    indebted for the preservation of the record in this part of the country, quietly made ready for a
                    campaign by half-soling his shoes while his wife prepared provisions and moulded bullets. He then
                    got out a knapsack which had already seen service in border-warfare, and started across country
                    afoot. Many of the settlers were entering 
                        Goshen
                     armed with the usual variety of effective weaponsâ€”with shot-guns, muskets,
                    rifles, old-fashioned horse pistols and butcher-knives. Men, women, and children came flocking into
                    the village hourly, crying, swearing, praying. The Indian war dances near Niles were interpreted as
                    preparation for war on that prairie.
            The first step taken was to send to Niles for more particular information. And then it was decided to
                    build a fort for the protection of the women and children. Before long, however, the messengers
                    dispatched to Niles reported that the danger was, at most, remote. But to verify the reports of
                    outrages in 
                        Kosciusko county
                    , which adjoins 
                        Elkhart
                     county on the south, a De Witt Mullinex and John Elsea went out into the wilderness
                    alone over an old Indian trail, to cover the 
                  
                     41Evidently the editorial calm of the Beacon in the face of danger did
                            not satisfy the more excitable of its patrons, for we read in the issue of July 4 :
                            "Some of our friends have blamed us for not giving all the rumors that have been in
                            circulation concerning the Frontier War. Our reason for not doing this is founded on the
                            best motives. We consider it wrong to grasp every vague tale and make It have some semblance
                            of truth by publishing. We know that our patrons all feel interested in hearing from the
                            seat of War, and whenever we get anything Official and Authentic we have, and intend giving
                            it to them."
                  True to this promise each issue printed some war news and the official reports of the
                            various officers up to September 15 when it published a long account of Black
                            Hawk's final defeat.
               
                     territory between 
                        Elkhart
                     river and Big Turkey Creek prairie in which there was no habitation. Their appearance
                    in the Indian village, Waubea Papoose, where knowledge of the uprising had apparently penetrated,
                    aroused great excitement and suspicion, allayed by the explanation that the visitors were in search
                    of seed-corn. The same pretext, offered through an interpreter, sufficed in a second Indian village,
                    where Oswego now stands, to melt the savages from hostile silence into an approach to welcome.
                    Although the report of these scouts contributed to quiet the apprehensions at 
                        Goshen
                    , the settlers, still bent on the fort, got the foundation laid, but, when they
                    disagreed over its name, they abandoned the work.
            Somewhat further south than the northernmost tier of counties of the state some ripples made
                    themselves felt. Some settlements had been made in White county, and so some alarmed families left
                    their homes when the rumors of Black Hawk's revolt reached them.43 And
                    into what later became Newton county, south of Lake county, about five hundred Kickapoo Indians came
                    from 
                        Illinois
                     during the war to stay for some little time, but they gave no trouble except when
                    whiskey was furnished them.44
            
            And yet though the reign of terror passed in a few weeks and it seemed quite unnecessary when no
                    hostile Indians had come nearer the Indiana border than seventy-five miles, yet the fear was
                    entirely justified, as the pioneers faced the danger of extinction. In the first place, they knew
                    quite well that the Potawatomi were closely related to the Sauk and naturally feared that they would
                    ally themselves with the latter in any movement against the whites, since they had regularly been
                    opposed to the 
                        United States
                     in each war which had arisen. And due credit should be given to Chief Moran45 of the 
                        Elkhart
                     region for his powerful influence in restraining the Potawatomi, for he was fully
                    convinced of the inability of the Indians to cope with the whites in diplomacy or in war and felt
                    that their safety depended upon the maintenance of peaceful relations with their powerful neighbors.
                    They knew that

                            article published in the

                     the Potawatomi still cherished resentment over the sale by
                    their chiefs, while under the influence of liquor, of one million acres for three cents an acre by
                    treaty arrangement in 1809, although they had yielded to necessity after the bloody defeat of 
                        Tippecanoe
                    . And the few scattered whites without military protection would have been without the
                    shadow of a doubt quite helpless against any band of Indians. In the second place, it was supposed
                    that the Sauk Indians would retreat to their British friends in 
                        Canada
                     instead of going beyond the 
                        Mississippi
                    , and all of the chief settlements of northern Indiana here discussed lay along the
                    route of the old Sauk trail. Furthermore, a large body of Sauk warriors had crossed northern Indiana
                    just at the beginning of the war,46 and so had deepened the settlersâ€™ conviction that the
                    objective was Malden.
            And slight as was the visible effects of the war on Indiana, it was not without results. It led
                    immediately to the removal of the Potawatomi from this state, for, although they had kept perfectly
                    quiet, the settlers were still restive under their presence. After repeated efforts, they were
                    finally forcibly expelled in the summer of 1838 not without some accompanying hardships to the
                    natives,47 though the last lingering bands did not leave this part of the state until 1840.
            In the second place, it put an end to government allowances for Indians this side of the 
                        Mississippi
                     and so entailed some loss for Indiana pioneers who were unable to recover for thefts by
                    Indians as had been the practice hitherto.

                  47It is no part of the purpose of the writer to enter into the story of
                        the removal of the tribes from Indiana, as the tale has already been told by Esarey (pp.
                        332â€”9). But it will not be amiss to tell a few episodes connected with their removal
                        from the northern part of the state which have not yet found their way into print. Mrs. Andrew
                        Johnson, daughter of the pioneer to whom reference has been made several times, tells how a
                        group of Indians filed into her father's cabin sometime after the war until it was
                        filled with silent figures. After remaining for what they deemed a proper length of time, they
                        departed likewise in silence. They had called to pay their respects to a neighbor whom they
                        honored before taking their departure from the country.
               Mrs. Theodore Armitage of Westville, a daughter of Henly Clyburn, the first settler of New
                        Durham township, relates that her father once cared for several hundred Indians in a grove just
                        west of the present town of Westville, at the time that they were withdrawing from the country.
                        Daniels, History of 
                                La Porte County
                            
                  , pp. 13â€”4.
            
            
            In the third place it virtually closed immigration to this section for that year,48 turning settlers to other localities who would in the natural course of events have located
                    in this part of the west.
            In the last place, it probably brought some minor local disturbances in each community affected. For
                    instance, it frightened the commissioners appointed to locate the county seat for 
                        La Porte
                     county and prevented them from performing their duty within the time limit set by the
                    state legislature. It ruined the 
                        Michigan
                     Road land sales set for the month of June in 
                        South Bend
                    .49 And it interfered seriously for a few weeks with the
                    construction work on that road.50 Though the matter of interference with farm
                    work and delay in the development of land and forest areas scheduled for cultivation has not found
                    comment in the records of early historians, it is unreasonable not to suppose that many plans were
                    laid aside until all danger of Indian attack was forgotten and the homesteader assured that he would
                    reap the profits of his labor.
            But it is an ill wind indeed that does not bring some good and so we must not fail to note the
                    soldiers in the army of General Scott who, noting the rich virgin soil and the opportunities for
                    ultimate large profits, elected to stay or returned in due time to stake out claims.51
            
            Like any storm at sea, the disturbance which Black Hawk set up in 
                        Illinois
                     sent out circles of waves which grew less and less violent until they quite faded away
                    near the eastern border of Indiana.
            
               
                  48Except for a little colony of forty-four who had previously arranged to
                        move to 
                            St. Joseph county
                         in the fall of 1832 and who arrived despite the scare.

                            St. Joseph
                         Beacon says on July 18: "From him (Judge Polk, commissioner on the 
                            Michigan
                         Road) we learn that 13,709 acres of Road lands were sold for the sum of
                        $18,134.39, making an average price of $1.32 1/2 per acre. The average
                        price paid was $7.00. We are gratified, however, to learn that land enough was sold
                        to redeem the script and reimburse the state treasury for the amount advanced on account of
                        surveys."
               It is probably remarkable that sales were effected at any price.

                    (Continued)
            By PERRET DUFOUR
            The first election held in 
                        Switzerland county
                     under the state government was held on the 3d of February, 1817. At that election the
                    clerk, sheriff, coroner, two associate judges and three county commissioners.
            The first term of the circuit court for said county was begun and held on the 17th of March, 1817. At
                    which time John Test appeared and presided as the circuit judge and produced his commission as such
                    judge.
            John Francis Dufour produced his commission as clerk, and John Francis Siebenthal produced his
                    commission as sheriff.
            James Dill, Hezekiah B. Hull, Miles C. Eggleston, John Lawrence, Samuel Merrill and Reuben Kidder
                    were admitted ex gratia to practice as attorneys and counsellors at law during
                    that term of the court.
            Stephen C. Stevens, Alexander A. Meek and Amos Lane were admitted as attorneys and counsellors at law
                    in the 
                        Switzerland
                     circuit court; they having produced regular licenses signed, by the Hon. Jesse L.
                    Holman and James Scott, Esq., two of the judges of the supreme court of the state, and the oath
                    required by law was administered to them. Stephen C. Stevens was appointed prosecuting attorney
                    during the term of the court. All prosecutions which had been commenced before the organization of
                    the state government were in the name of the 
                        United States
                    , some of which the sheriff wade return non est inventus, alias capias
                    were ordered to be issued, and the defendants be held to bail in the sum of $50.
            At the meeting of the court on the second day William Cotton came into court, produced his commission
                    as one of the associate judges, took the required oath and took his seat  on the bench. On this same day Joseph F. Farly was admitted ex gratia as an attorney and counsellor at law.
            On the fourth day of the term the court made the following order: 
                        The court now continues the appointment of Stephen C. Stevens, Esq. as prosecuting attorney
                            for the county of 
                                Switzerland
                             for and during good behavior.
                    
            
            The court allowed Stephen C. Stevens S40 for his services as prosecuting attorney during the term.
                    The associate judge was allowed $10 for his services during the term, and the three
                    constables who attended to and rendered services as such during the term, George Wade, Newton H.
                    Tapp and Frederick Waldo, were allowed $5 each.
            At the second term of the court, held on the 16th of June, 1817. H. B. Hull, John Lawrence, William
                    Hendricks, Henry P. Thornton, Samuel Merril, Alexander Holton and James Noble were admitted as
                    attorneys and counsellors at law in this court, they, having produced regular licenses as required
                    by law, took the oath required by law.
            On the third day of the term, the other associate judge, James McClure, appeared for the first time,
                    produced his commission, and the oath required by law was administered to him, when he took his seat
                    on the bench.
            On the fourth day of the term Reuben W. Nelson was admitted to practice in the court, satisfactory
                    evidence having been produced that he had been admitted to practice in the supreme court.
            On the last day of the term the court made the following order: 
                        Ordered that the device of the seal of this court be the American eagle with thirteen stars
                            about its head, and immediately over its head two bunches of grapes, and the words, "
                                Switzerland County
                             Circuit Court" engraved around it, as it appears above.
                    
            
            Just to the left, and above the order is an impression made with the seal, being the seal now used as
                    the seal of the circuit court.
            The October term, 1817, of the court was begun and held by the associate judges alone, no presiding
                    judge appearing.
            
            At the April term, 1818, of the court there was no judge present until the second day. On that day of
                    the term Alexander Gilliland and Daniel J. Caswell were admitted to practice as attorneys and
                    counsellors as were also Truman Richards, Miles C. Eggleston and William Carpenter.
            At the July term, 1818, Stephen C. Stevens having resigned his appointment as prosecuting attorney,
                    Hezekiah B. Hull was appointed in his stead.
            At the March term, 1819, the court was begun and held by the associate judges the first day when John
                    Watts, father of Col. Johnson Watts appeared, produced his commission as presiding judge, and
                    entered upon the discharge of his duty as such judge.
            On the first day of the term John Dumont, William McCray, Isaac M. Johnston and Nathaniel French were
                    admitted ex gratia as attorneys and counsellors at law during the term. John Test
                    and James B. Ray were admitted to practice.
            At the February term, 1820, no presiding judge appears to have been present, and the associates who
                    had been on the bench from the formation of the county during the territorial government, had given
                    place to Abner Clarkson and Ralph Cotton, who appear to have been the only judges on the bench
                    during the term.
            Truman Richards was appointed prosecuting attorney during the term. At this term George H. Dunn was
                    admitted to practice as an attorney at law. At the May term, 1820, Miles C. Eggleston, who for so
                    many years was the presiding judge of the circuit to which 
                        Switzerland county
                     was attached, first appeared, took his seat as the presiding judge of the 
                        Switzerland
                     circuit court.
            What the population of the county was in 1820 it is not possible now to state, as the person
                    appointed to take the census for that year was taken sick and did not complete the same, and where
                    he had enumerated it appears that it was not very accurately done. The assessor appointed by the
                    state authorities to make an enumeration of the free white male inhabitants above the age of 21
                    years, for the year 1820, returned 1,122, which multiplied by five, the average proportion of the
                    whole to the free white males of 21 years of age and  upwards,
                    amounts to 5,610, so it may be safely estimated that the population of the county amounted to that
                    number.
            
               
                        Vevay
                    , the seat of justice, in 1820, contained upwards of 100 log, brick and frame dwelling
                    houses (the log outnumbering both brick and frame nearly two to one,) a brick courthouse, a jail, a
                    brick market house, a printing office, postoffice, an ox saw mill, two horse grist mills, a seminary
                    of learning incorporated in 1816, a circulating library, a branch of the State Bank of Indiana and
                    two Free Mason lodges.
            A meeting house for the Presbyterians and one for the Methodists were spoken of as being about to be
                    erected during the year 1820.
            The court house and school house were the only places where public religious services, such as
                    preaching and the place of holding Sabbath school, were held, until about 1828, when the
                    Presbyterians formed a church and built by subscription a meeting house on the lot where the present
                    Presbyterian church now stands. An account of the organization of the Presbyterian church and the
                    subscription for building the church, and other matters connected therewith, will be given in a
                    future number.
            The population of Vevay in 1820 was about six hundred souls, and the influx of population was so
                    great that many small houses contained two or three families; and in the summer of that year it
                    became very sickly, and as a natural consequence, the inhabitants being so crowded together, many
                    died of the prevailing fever, which was billious fever in a very malignant form. Many corpses, after
                    lying for a few hours, became so very yellow that many persons pronounced it "yellow
                    fever." More than one sixth of the population died during that summer and fall, and Vevay
                    after that time for many years, was shunned by persons seeking a place of settlement in the west, as
                    being a very sickly place. But the sickness that prevailed to such an alarming extent was not
                    confined to Vevay alone, but every place in the great 
                        Mississippi
                     valley shared the same fate.
            It was several years until the prejudice against Vevay as being a sickly place was entirely removed
                    from the minds of strangers.
            
            For many years from 1817 to 1826 farming was a very slow means of getting money together. In fact,
                    every article the farmer raised was at very low prices, and it required but a small amount of any
                    article of produce to overstock the market. As a comparison of the prices in those times with
                    present prices may be interesting to the farmers who raise produce to sell, and their wives who sell
                    butter, eggs and chickens, (not for "pin money",) but for the purpose of laying up
                    a few hundred dollars for a rainy way, some such comparison will be made: Eggs, for instance, were
                    brought to town and sold for 1 and 2Â½ cents per dozen, and sold with difficulty at that
                    price for goods in the store; now readily sell at from 10 to 15 cents a dozen in cash and
                    "no grumbling." Butter, 6Â¼ cents per pound when not more than thirty or
                    forty pounds on hand in town; now 20@40 cents cash, no matter if there is one thousand or two
                    thousand pounds in town. Chickens, from 37Â½ to 50 cents per dozen, and difficult to sell
                    them even at that price, now from $3 to $5 per dozen and no drag at that
                    price. These are the articles the farmer's wives sold to get their pins, needles,
                    pasteboards, and a little calico for sun bonnets and aprons. Now they sell them for cash, and lay up
                    perhaps hundreds of dollars annually.
            Then pork, in the fall, was sold with difficulty in Vevay at from $1.25 to
                    $1.75 per 100 pounds; this last fall it sold in Vevay at from $11 to
                    $13 per 100 pounds. Corn then sold at from 12Â½ to 18Â¾ cents per
                    bushel, wheat 31Â½ to 37Â½ cents per bushel, potatoes from 6Â¼ to
                    18Â¾, cents per bushel, and all that were sold in town to the traders was paid for in
                    goods. In the spring bacon hams sold at from 2 to 2Â½ cents per pound, and sides and
                    shoulders in proportion.
            A farmer living a few miles from 
                        Vevay
                    , in the fall of 1812, had about 1,000 pounds of pork, which he brought to Vevay to
                    sell, was offered $1.25 per 100 pounds, would not take that; took it to 
                        Louisville
                     in a large perogue, where he realized $1.75 per 100 pounds, and was three
                    days and two nights coming up the river against the current with the perogue. Truly the farmers of 
                        Switzerland county
                     have had their lot cast in a pleasant country, and they may be thankful to Almighty God
                    for their good heritage.
            
            After the termination of the War of 1812 with Great Britain many European emigrants came to Vevay and
                    the neighboring settlements in the county. During the years 1815, 1816, 1817, and 1818, great
                    numbers from Europe, seeking homes in the west came to this county; many of whom purchased lands and
                    permanently settled among us.
            A number of Scotch families, and some others, formed the settlement on Long Run about that time, but
                    the exact date and years is not now recollected. Among the Scotch who settled on Long Run were Niel
                    McCallum, Duncan McCallum, John McCallum, Donal Cowan, the Malcomsons, and perhaps one or two other
                    families. They were, in their religious persuasions, what are commonly denominated Seventh Day
                    Baptists. It was quite a novelty to the then population to see these good people apparently idle all
                    day of Saturdays, no one stirring about in the clearings and no sound of the axe to be heard, plied
                    by these hardy Scots in felling the forest trees. When on Sunday the passerby in that settlement
                    could see the men and boys at work clearing up the land which they designed for cultivation and hear
                    the sound of the woodman's axe as he plied it to fell some large oak or beech, and this too
                    while the passerby was wending his way to some appointment whither he was going to hear the word of
                    God expounded. Eventually these men lived to enjoy the fruits of their labor, and they have passed
                    from among us leaving behind them a good name, and their descendants to enjoy it to the fullest
                    extent the lands which their fathers cleared up for their use.
            Philip and John Romeril, from the Isle of Jersey, settled on Long Run above where these Scotch
                    settled, and opened a farm, and some years after while all were from home save a sister some demon
                    in human form passed by and with a deadly aim shot her with a leaden ball dead, and when the other
                    members of the family returned home they found her lying cold in death. Suspicion was fixed on a
                    person named Long, but no proof of his being the guilty one could be brought against him,
                    consequently he was set at liberty.
            The family of Detraz came to Vevay sometime in the fall of 1816 or summer of 1817. They had not been
                    here very long until the old gentleman, while bathing in the 
                        Ohio
                     river,  was drowned. The body was recovered at 
                        Madison
                    ; an inquest was held over the body by Abner Clarkson, (now of 
                        Vevay
                    ,) who, being a justice of the peace in Jefferson county, acted as coroner. The remains
                    were interred at 
                        Madison
                    , where they are to remain until their final resurrection. The family left consisted of
                    three sons by a former wife, John, Benjamin, and Francis, his widow, (his second wife,) and two
                    sons, Abraham and Louis, who reside in Craig township, the latter living on the land purchased for
                    the home of the father and his family.
            About this time, perhaps 1818, Frederick L. Grisard, (now dead) and his brother in law, Belrichard,
                    came to Vevay and settled below Indian creek on the land owned by the LeClerc's, and part
                    by William Tilly, where Mr. Grisard carried on his occupation of blacksmithing for some years, when
                    he sold the land and came to Vevay and bought the lots where R. F. Grisard now resides. Mr.
                    Belrichard, who was a shoemaker by profession, carried on his trade for some years, when he finally
                    sold out and removed to 
                        Louisville
                     where he died, leaving a son and daughter. It would be a novelty for some of your
                    readers to see a horse shod in the manner it was performed by Mr. Grisard for the writer, on more
                    than one occasion. It was performed, perhaps, by driving the nails in the usual manner, and for
                    trimming the hoof after the nails were driven the foot was placed on a sort of stool, and while
                    there was trimmed and rasped, one holding the horse's foot on the stool.
            Somewhere about this same time a Swiss named James Bolens came to Vevay and brought with him several
                    young men, who had not the means of paying their passage.
            Mr. Bolens married to Miss Pernet, a cousin of David E. Pernet, who resided so long at Mt. Sterling.
                    He settled near Mt. Sterling, where the mound stood, and lived in a neat and comfortable looking log
                    cabin for some time. He had brought with him to America a number of watches; and while living in the
                    cabin alluded to, the watches were hung up against the wall near a window fronting the road. One
                    night some thief in passing, removed a pane of glass, put his hand through and took some of the
                    watches. In the morning the watches were  missing. Mr. Bolens,
                    mounting a horse, rode to Vevay and secured the services of Jacob Malin and another, and started
                    down the river towards 
                        Madison
                     in search of the thief, whom they overtook at or near Indian 
                        Kentucky
                    , still having in his possession the watches. The thief was placed on a horse, his feet
                    tied under the horse and his hands behind and brought back as far as "Uncle
                    Morerod's" gate, where they halted. The thief was given his choice of being taken
                    to town and put in jail and kept there until court, or take forty lashes on his bare back with a raw
                    hide. He chose the latter. He was taken back of "Uncle Morerod's" barn,
                    there tied to a tree, his back made bare, a bottle of wine given him to drink, which he swallowed,
                    when the forty stripes were well applied, when his back was washed with wine, his clothes replaced,
                    led back to the gate on the river bank, a bottle of wine given him to drink, and he advised to leave
                    and never to show himself in the neighborhood again. He made his way down the road in the direction
                    of 
                        Madison
                    .
            In 1821 or 1822 Mr. Bolens, being at 
                        New Orleans
                     with a cargo of pork, stopped at a hotel, on entering he observed a person sitting with
                    his face towards the door by which he entered, who so soon as Bolens entered, turned his face, and
                    he could not get a fair chance to see his face; but that man left the hotel the next day and was not
                    seen again by Bolens about 
                        New Orleans
                    . Being unable to sell his pork at 
                        New Orleans
                     he went to Havana with it, and there he again encountered the man he had seen at the
                    hotel in 
                        New Orleans
                    , and again the man seemed to shun him and left the hotel where they had stopped. Bolens
                    was always of the belief that the thief who stole his watches, was whipped so unmercifully, and the
                    man he met at 
                        New Orleans
                    , and Havanna, were one and the same; and that while in 
                        New Orleans
                     and Havanna after he had seen him, he was somewhat uneasy lest he might be waylaid and
                    murdered by that man, and fully prepared himself for anything of the kind.
            About the year 1817 the family of David E. Pernet came to the country and settled at Mt. Sterling.
                    The father, becoming somewhat deranged, hanged himself in the barn. The land which was owned by him
                    then descended to David E. and  John Pernet, his sons. David E.,
                    who was so well and favorably known by the citizens of Mt. Sterling and the surrounding country,
                    turned his attention to farming and keeping a retail store and house of entertainment in Mt.
                    Sterling, for many years; when he finally sold out and removed to 
                        Bethlehem
                    , in Clark county, where he turned his attention to farming and keeping a retail store
                    until his death. John removed to 
                        Covington
                    , and afterwards went to 
                        Bethlehem
                     and entered into partnership with his brother in merchandising.
            About the same year the Thiebaud family came to this country and settled on a farm below Indian
                    creek, on which Justin Thiebaud now resides. If ever there was a family that could be said to be
                    industrious in the true meaning of that word the Thiebaud family were truly an industrious family.
                    The old lady was an extraordinary woman in many respects, she was a loving wife, a kind and
                    indulgent mother; a pious Christian, a good citizen, and one whose example, if followed, would lead
                    to prosperity and happiness. Many of the readers of this article will remember how she toiled and
                    worked to assist her husband and sons, (who were then small) to improve the farm and make it a
                    suitable home for them and their daughters, which she lived to see, and too all her sons and
                    daughters grown up and in prosperous business, useful members of society and ornaments in the church
                    of the Lord Jesus.
            The sons of the Thiebaud family are Charles, who lives on Main street, and carries on the boot and
                    shoe making business, and keeps a large shoe store. Justin lives on the farm owned and opened by the
                    old gentleman, with the assistance of his helpmate. One of the daughters married a man living in 
                        Madison
                    , named Bachman. One married David E. Pernet, and is now living in 
                        Bethlehem
                    , in Clark county. One married Benoit Courvoisier, and is now living on Ferry street in
                    this town. She is the mother of our present worthy county treasurer. One married Thomas A. Haskell,
                    and now resides near Siebenthal's mill on Long Run. One married Ulysses P. Schenck, the
                    successful merchant and produce dealer of 
                        Vevay
                    .
            It may seem to many a matter of small moment that anything of such personal reference to families and
                    persons should  be mentioned in these articles but let every one
                    reflect and ask themselvesâ€”What would I not give had my father, when a young man fifty,
                    sixty or seventy years ago, settling in this new country, committed to writing many of the incidents
                    relating to that settlement so that I might now have it before me to read, and know something of the
                    manner of life led by them in the wilderness?
            About 1817 the settlement in Pleasant township known as Dutch settlement began to be formed. Sometime
                    about that period Cornelies A. Voris, the Carnines, Demarees, Vandevers, Harmons, and some of those
                    old settlers came into the county from 
                        Kentucky
                    , principally, and in a few years that part of the county began to increase in
                    population quite rapidly. It was not many years until the farmers from that portion of the county
                    began to supply the citizens of Vevay with provisions of all kinds, butter, eggs and chickens,
                    through the summer, pork, venison, oats, flax, etc., in the fall. They soon organized a church, and
                    built a log church not far from what once was called "Stapp's Store,"
                    near David Henry's. That log church has been replaced by a neat and comfortable frame
                    church, and is familiarly called the Dutch church. It belongs to the old school Presbyterian
                    denomination.
            On the west side of Pleasant township and south of Stapp's store being in the southwest
                    corner of the township, quite a number of Scotch families settled as early, perhaps, as 1817 and
                    1818, and their numbers were added to by accessions from time to time until quite a large settlement
                    of those industrious and worthy people was made, and extends over into the adjoining county of
                    Jefferson. Among the number now thought of were the four brothers William, James, John, and Samuel
                    Culbertson, the Mortons, Glenns, Makenzies, Scotts, and many others whose names are not now
                    recollected.
            In a few years these industrious people opened farms and were very successful in their farming
                    operations, and that section of the county is under a good state of cultivation.
            About this period John, James and Philip Schenck, his wife and his son Ulysses, then a lad of 10
                    years old, came to the country and settled on the hill back of the Thiebaud farm. Mr. Schenck was a
                    tinner by trade, and as there was no tinner  in town Mr. Schenck
                    came to town once or twice a week and gathered up all the tinware that required mending, took it
                    home with him and mended it when not engaged in the farm work, and returned it to the owners, and so
                    he mended the tinware for the citizens of the town for sometime, when he finally went to
                    Shippingport, 
                        Kentucky
                    ; and there, during the time of the digging of the canal around the falls, he kept a
                    store, in which clothing, shoes and every other article required by the laborers on the canal, was
                    kept; and during the digging of the canal made a considerable amount of money, when he finally
                    purchased the farm on which he now lives from Louis Gex Oboussier, removing from Shippingport to the
                    farm in 1834 or 1835.
            His son, Ulysses P. Schenck, commenced business for himself during the time the canal was being made
                    and made a considerable amount of money in this business. He afterwards leased a lot fronting the
                    river near the mouth of the canal in 
                        Louisville
                    , and continued his business for some years after his father removed to his farm and all
                    his surplus means was sent to his father, who loaned it out for the son at 10 per cent interest,
                    secured by mortgage. This he continued to do until 1837, when he purchased the lot on which his
                    large store stands, built a house suitable for dwelling and storeroom and commenced business there
                    in 1838.
            His prosperous and successful career as a merchant and trader is known to most of the farmers of 
                        Switzerland county
                    , and the pecuniary aid he has extended to many of our farmers in assisting them to buy
                    and improve farms, whereby they were enabled to make for themselves comfortable homes, is a proof of
                    his sagacity as a financier and business man. He may be said to be in the strictest sense of the
                    word a sagacious and shrewd business man.
            Frederick L. Grisard, one of our successful mechanics, came to the 
                        United States
                     with his father and mother in 1818 when he was about 10 years of age, remained with his
                    father until he arrived at a proper age to learn a trade, choosing the profession of a blacksmith
                    for his future occupation. In 1824 he placed himself under the instruction of a Mr. Oberlee of 
                        Cincinnati
                    , a proficient in the trade, and after serving a 
                    sufficient length of time to become acquainted with all the secrets of the trade, commenced business
                    in Vevay in 1827. where he continued in business, realizing good profits for his work, and having
                    gained the reputation of being the best workman of the kind in all the region round about for many
                    miles. As a proof of which it may be remarked that more blacksmiths went out from among the
                    apprentices instructed in his shop than from any shop in any town of the size of Vevay in the whole
                    country. The names of many of those who went out from under his instruction as votaries of Vulcan,
                    may not be uninteresting to the readers of these articles, are here given: Henry Hatch, William
                    Malcomson, Lewuel Siebenthal, Daniel Detraz, William Rochat, Joseph Jagers, and others who are not
                    now recollected.
            In the fall of 1816 or spring of 1817, Joseph Malin came to Vevay and commenced the saddle and
                    harness making business, which he continued to carry on very successfully until sometime in 1833 or
                    1834, when he turned the business over to others; James W. Cole, perhaps, being one of his
                    successors in that business. Mr. Malin had been merchandising for a few years in connection with the
                    saddle and harness making business and turning his attention entirely to merchandising, he entered
                    into that business very actively and with much success. He occupied one part of the house in which
                    Robert A. 
                        Knox
                     now resides, on Main street, for a shop when he first came to the place, and then moved
                    into a small two-story frame which stood on or near the spot where the house stands on Market
                    street, occupied by Mr. Shaw, where he remained for several years, when he removed to a building on
                    Main street, about where the two-story frame occupied by J. C. Wells & Co. and S. E.
                    & J. K. Pleasants and adjoining to the house on the corner of Ferry and Main, in which he
                    carried on the mercantile business.
            Abner Clarkson came to Vevay in the fall of 1817, commenced the selling of goods in a room in the
                    building now occupied by Robert A. 
                        Knox
                    , on Main street, and continued there until he completed his building on Ferry street
                    opposite to the present store of Harwood & Son, where he continued in business for many
                    years, in a word he has been engaged in  business of some kind
                    ever since he came to Vevay in 1817 until the present day, and although in the 85th year of his age
                    he still attends to a grocery store.
            About the year 1816 or 1817 there came to this county a man by the name of Smith, who settled in the
                    neighborhood of Quercus grove which if not at that very place, whose object appeared to be to take
                    the bark of the oak and by grinding it, beating it in some manner, so that it could be packed in
                    hogsheads and shipped to Europe for coloring cloths and yarns. He selected a large tract of land at
                    Quercus grove which was heavily timbered with oak. Whether he purchased the land of individuals,
                    entered in congress, or became only a squatter is not known to the writer, suffice it to say that he
                    commenced his operations on quite a large scale, and succeeded in getting a sufficient quantity to
                    load one or two flatboats, which he sent to 
                        New Orleans
                     in charge of Edward Patton (whose name is familiar to most of the residents of 
                        Switzerland county
                     who have resided in the county since 1840,) as supercargo, which bark was sent to 
                        England
                     and it is thought by the writer that Edward Patton went to 
                        England
                     in charge of this shipment as supercargo. The writer is not certain whether any other
                    shipments of bark were made from the barkworks of this man Smith or not. Neither does he know to
                    what Smith was indebted for the cognomen that was applied to him by many of "Rarified
                    Smith," but is of the opinion that it was on account of some theory he had advanced of
                    using rarified air for the purpose of propelling machinery instead of steam. It may be that John
                    Gibbons, Esq., who lives on Grant's creek, may know and could give some better account of
                    this man "Rarified Smith" and his connection with the bark business at the
                    "barkworks," as his establishment was called in the great Quercus grove in Posey
                    township. It is thought that Smith left his "bark works" about 1821 or 1822, for
                    he had left there before the father and family of Martin R. Green came to that part of the county,
                    which was in 1823.
            For sometime after the close of the War of 1812 small change was very scarce, and it was with
                    difficulty that change could be made in the transaction of business. To obviate this difficulty the
                    practice of cutting a silver dollar into quarters  and eighths,
                    and silver half dollars into quarters and twelveand-a-half-cent pieces. In many cases to make the
                    most of a silver dollar and to turn a penny, instead of cutting it into eighth piece, nine pieces
                    would be made, thereby making an odd twelve-and-a-half cents. Sometimes persons who handled much of
                    this cut money would have their pockets so much worn as to make holes in them through which
                    occasionally and odd "ninepence" would be lost. To guard against such losses some
                    persons would have a leather pocket made, which was not so easily worn as the common cloth pocket.
            Some of the business men of the town resorted to issuing tickets for 61/4, 121/2, 183/4, 25 and 50
                    cents, which were received by all the men in business in town as change. These tickets were redeemed
                    whenever three or five dollars worth were presented, in current bank notes on the banks of 
                        Cincinnati
                     and 
                        Kentucky
                    , or any other notes of banks in other states that were passing currently at the time.
            Lucien Gex, Rawleigh Day, John F. Dufour and one or two others, as also the corporation of 
                        Vevay
                    , issued tickets which passed as currently here as the notes of any bank.
            To show the manner in which small change was secured, the following announcement to the public was
                    made, and the agreement of those in business in the town to take the small bills for their goods and
                    wares: 
                        To the Public
                  
                        Considering the scarcity of small change and the solicitations of some of my friends, I have
                            been induced to issue small bills, redeemable with current bank notes. I intend keeping by
                            me at all times three and five dollar notes on the banks of 
                                Cincinnati
                             or 
                                Kentucky
                            , or other good banks, to the amount of the bills which I may have out. I will
                            received the said bills in payment of postages, fees or any other dues to me or to other
                            persons, which I am authorized to received, and I will redeem them whenever the holder
                            thereof will change one of the notes aforesaid. If he has not of my bills to amount to three
                            dollars I will receive small bills on the banks of 
                                Kentucky
                             or 
                                Cincinnati
                             or other good banks, or specie to make up the balance.
                        J. F. Dufour.
                  
                        Vevay, August 5, 1816.
                        We, the subscribers, will received in payment of any dues John F. Dufour's bills,
                            until we notify to the contrary. Thos. Armstrong, Daniel  Dufour, Jonathan Reeder, David McCormick, Bazilla Clark, Rawleigh Day, Joseph Noble,
                            Isaac Stanley, Joseph Bentley, Jonas Baldwin, Charles F. Krutz, John F. Siebenthal.
                    
            
            In accordance with the foregoing statement of John F. Dufour and the agreement of the business men
                    who signed an agreement to receive the small bills, such bills were printed, signed, numbered and
                    put in circulation. And they, with those afterwards issued by Lucien Gex, Rawleigh Day and the
                    corporation of 
                        Vevay
                    , formed the small change used in this community for some years.
            At the time the stone jail was built the county commissioners, at the request of the contractors,
                    with a view of having small change issued county orders for 61/4, 121/2, 25 and 50 cents in part pay
                    to the contractors for the work in building the jail. That was, perhaps, about the year 1821 or
                    â€˜22, exact time not recollected.
            The legislature of the territory of Indiana, in September, 1814, chartered the bank of 
                        Vincennes
                    , which was in existence at the commencement of the state government. In January, 1817,
                    the legislature of the state passed an act adopting the bank of 
                        Vincennes
                     as the State Bank of Indiana until the 1st day of October, 1835, and no longer. The
                    stock of the bank was increased by an additional capital of $1,000,000 divided into ten
                    thousand shares of $100 each, of which three thousand seven hundred and fifty shares,
                    amounting to $375,000, were reserved for the state, to be subscribed for from time to
                    time by the governor, as it should be found convenient, having due regard to the funds out of which
                    such shares should be payable. And the remaining six thousand two hundred and fifty shares should be
                    subscribed for by individuals, companies or bodies corporate in the manner specified in said act. By
                    the 3d section of the act, subscriptions towards constituting such additional bank stock for three
                    thousand shares, were to be opened on the first day of April, 1817, in the several counties therein
                    named under the direction of persons named in the act, without naming any of the counties except 
                        Switzerland
                    . It may be said in relation to that county that the subscriptions were to be opened at 
                        Vevay
                    , in said county, under  the direction of John
                    Gilliland, Laurence Nihell and Daniel Dufour for two hundred shares. The law further provided that
                    in addition to the counties named that subscriptions should be taken in each and every county
                    organized during that session of the General Assembly, or which might at any time thereafter be
                    organized. Said subscriptions to be taken at the seat of justice of each county, for any number of
                    shares not exceeding one hundred, at such times and in such manner as the General Assembly might
                    direct.
            The stock for the branch at Vevay was subscribed, and the bank went into active operation sometime
                    during the summer or fall of 1817, and continued in operation until February, 1820; when it,
                    together with the parent institution at 
                        Vincennes
                     and all other branches thereof, failed, and were brought into liquidation. In 1819 the
                    directors of the Vevay branch authorized the issuing of a certain amount of notes of one, three and
                    five dollars, and sent to the printers at 
                        Cincinnati
                    , Reynolds & Co., to have them printed. The notes thus printed were put in
                    circulation and passed very currently for some time. Here is the copy of a $5 note:
                        
                        5. No. 766 Five Dollars B V
                        This note for Five Dollars will be received at the Branch B of the State Bank of Indiana, at 
                                Vevay
                            , as cash, in payment of debts.
                        John F. Dufour, Pres't.
                        
                     
                                Vevay
                            , Ind., 5th Au., 1819.
                    
            
            Unfortunately for the bank, by some mistake or otherwise, five hundred $5 bills more than
                    were authorized to be printed were printed, and signed by some person other than the president; and
                    many of them thus counterfeited were found in circulation. This fraud upon the bank was found out by
                    John F. Dufour, the president. In December, 1819, while in 
                        Cincinnati
                    , on business for the bank, calling on Hugh and James Glenn to receive $2,500
                    which they had collected of Elijah Pierson for the banks, one of the Glenns placed on the table
                    several bundles of the notes of the Branch Bank receivable in payment of debts, saying to Mr.
                    Dufour: 
                    
                        Here are $2500 in Vevay receivables. I counted the most of them myself last night,
                            and some are in the same bundles as they came out of the Bank.
                    
            
            Mr. Dufour was about taking the money without counting it over, but in looking in one of the bundles
                    he saw that ones, threes and fives were mixed together; he then concluded to count it. When in the
                    act of counting them he perceived some of the fives had a forged signature, which he threw out, and
                    told Glenn he would not receive them, as they were counterfeits. Glenn for some time insisted that
                    they were genuine. After considerable conversation between Glenn and Dufour they concluded to search
                    the other bundles and found a considerable number of the fives with forged signatures. The plate
                    appeared to be genuine. The number of these bills found in Mr. Glenn's possession were
                    probably between 150 and 200. Immediately on this discovery Mr. Dufour's suspicions were
                    aroused.
            So soon as Mr. Dufour left Glenn's he went to the printers who had printed the bills,
                    (Reynolds & Co.) and upon inquiring there found that they had printed five hundred
                    $5 bills more than the bank had authorized, and they had been returned to the bank by the
                    person entrusted with having them printed.
            A statement of this affair was made by Mr. Dufour, in writing, prepared for the Royal Arch Chapter of
                    Masons, and was published in the Vevay Times and

            On the 7th of February, 1820, a statement of the condition of the Branch Bank at Vevay was made, and

                    the president, to an agent appointed by the parent institution to receive the same, who gave a
                    receipt therefor, as follows: 
                        19th February, 1820. Received the Branch Bank in the situation as certied by the Committee
                            within named, and the books, papers and furniture thereto belonging, from the said John F.
                            Dufour, President.
                        Isaac Blackford, Ag't.
                  
                    
            
            Thus ended the Branch Bank at 
                        Vevay
                    . But it is said that its condition was much better than that of the Branch at 
                        Brookville
                     or the parent institution at 
                        Vincennes
                    . Be that as it may, the whole concern came to an end much sooner than was contemplated
                    by the act passed by the legislature making  the Bank of 
                        Vincennes
                     the State Bank of Indiana. So much for the history of the Branch Bank of 
                        Vevay
                    .
            Several persons having expressed a desire to know in what manner the lands were divided between the
                    Swiss colonists, that division cannot be better explained than by giving in full the agreement as it
                    was written and translated, which is as follows: 
                        A Covenant of Association for the Settlement of the Lands of Switzerland on
                                the River Ohio
                  
                        The Congress of the 
                                United States
                             of America, in order to encourage the cultivation of the vine, having granted
                            to John James Dufour and his associates the power of buying four sections or tracts of land,
                            by an act entitled "An act to authorize J. S. Dufour and associates to buy a
                            certain parcel of land issued on the 1st of May, 1802." The subscribers,
                            vinedressers by trade, or sons of vinedressers, forming exclussively this association
                            mentioned by the law, in order to promote the views of Congress, and to fulfill the
                            engagements required by the said law, and those to which they have voluntarily submitted in
                            their petition presented to Congress on this subject, have agreed to submit to the following
                            conditions:
                        1st. To plant the vine and make their principal business their cultivation.
                        2nd. Not to be able either to sell or dispose of his share in whatever manner unless the
                            receipts and certificates attesting the payment of the whole of said share.
                        3rd. The choice of the lands being made by a majority of the associates upon the tracts or
                            sections No. 12 and 14, and the fractions 13 and 23, 2nd township, 3d range, containing in
                            the whole 1,879 70â€”100 acres registered on the 11th of June, 1802, having still
                            one tract or section to choose. But as fractions 13 and 23 are not together a whole section,
                            it follows that the total purchase amounts to but 2,519 70â€”100 acres which are
                            divided into thirteen shares containing each 193 80â€”100 acres and numbered from
                            West to East, to-wit: One for each of the following, John James Dufour, Daniel Dufour, John
                            F. Dufour, David Dufour, Aime Dufour, Daniel Vincent Dufour, Jane Maria Dufour, Antoinette
                            Dufour, Susannah Margarita Dufour, Francis Lewis de Siebenthal, John Francis de Siebenthal,
                            John Daniel Morerod, Philip Bettens.
                        4th. The said lands being on the banks of the river 
                                Ohio
                            , and being surveyed diagonally with the river, it is agreed that each lot shall
                            meet the river, and its breadth upon said river shall be the following: The most western, or
                            No. 1, 67 poles; No. 2, 65 poles; No. 3, 63 poles, and so on; and in order to run at right
                            angles, the lines of length of each lot, said Dufour engages himself to do everything in his
                            power to obtain the fraction and section adjoining the western side; and in that case  every lot shall be drawn in length for the quantity, at
                            right angles with the course of the river upon the above breadth. But if in the course of
                            six years the said straightening cannot be made the lots shall remain parallel to the lines
                            north and south run by the survey. Agreed moreover that Francis Lewis de Siebenthal shall
                            have the lot No. 1, Philip Bettens that No. 2, John Daniel Morerod that No. 3, John Francis
                            de Siebenthal that No. 4, and the family Dufour the other nine lots. Being reserved here
                            that if the family Dufour furnishes John Francis de Siebenthal to the west end adjoining the
                            lot No. 1 as much ground measured in the same manner as the lot No. 4, the Siebenthal shall
                            be bound to received the said ground in lieu of No. 4, which shall belong to the family
                            Dufour; provided the said exchange takes place before the end of the year 1808.
                        5th. In order to establish order from the beginning it is agreed to leave a road 100 feet in
                            breadth along a line run on the second bank, which shall be planted with four rows of trees
                            at thirty-three feet distance, and fronting said road shall the buildings be placed.
                        6th. In order to indemnify the family of the Dufour's of the costs and trouble they
                            have been at (at least John James Dufour), by traveling in the 
                                United States
                             to choose a convenient place of settlement, and presenting a petition to
                            Congress, it shall be given him or family the sum of $100 for each lot, to be
                            paid before the 1st of January, 1812, diminishing six per cent, unto the day of payment,
                            upon the sums that shall have been paid before said time.
                        As a security of the said covenant each of us engages the whole of his property present and
                            hereafter, and in witness puts his name and seal this, 20th of January, 1803, at first
                            vineyard.

                        I certify this to be as exact a translation as can possibly be made of the French original as
                            to the substance of it, and nearly the same words.
                        Chas. Mentelle
                  
                    
            
            In relation to the road that is provided to be laid out 100 feet wide on the second bank, the writer
                    remembers when quite a small boy to have seen some of the trees on the bank in front of the Morerod,
                    Bettens, Golay (now Danglade) and de  Siebenthal (now Norrisey)
                    farms. The houses of which farms fronted to the road. He also recollects when the width of the road
                    was outside of the edge of the bank in front of the Morerod and Bettens tracts.
            As these colonists had been accustomed to use good cold spring water in their native country, which
                    came gushing out of the mountains it was very natural that they should in some manner furnish
                    themselves with such a necessary beverage in thisâ€”then new homeâ€”and as there
                    were no springs, they had to resort to the digging of wells. Mr. Morerod had one dug near his house
                    sometime in 1812 or â€˜13. Others were dug in the settlement; the depth of the wells in the
                    river bottom near Vevay were from 85 to 90 feet. Mr. Morerod's was about 85 feet deep.
            On the 7th of August,. 1815, John F. Dufour entered into a written contract with William Scott and
                    Samuel Smith to dig, curb with timber, and wall up with stone a well at or near the corner of said
                    Dufour's dwelling house in the town of 
                        Vevay
                    . Said well was to be of the same dimensions as to width and thickness of the walls as
                    that of Jean D. Morerod near 
                        Vevay
                    , and to be of such a depth as always to have at least three feet of water in it. In
                    walling up that part where the water would rise moss was to be put between the stones to prevent the
                    sand from getting through. The curbing was to be commenced with the digging. As the well would be
                    near the corner of said Dufour's house, the said Scott and Smith obligated themselves to
                    pay said Dufour all damages that might be occasioned to his house in case the said well, or any part
                    thereof, should cave in before it was completely finished and for two years afterwards. The well was
                    to be completely finished by the 1st of November following, for which work said Dufour obligated
                    himself to pay them $2.871/2 per foot for every foot said well should measure in depth
                    when completely finished, to the depth of 70 feet, and $3 per foot for every foot over
                    and above 70 feet. The well was finished and was at the north corner of Market and Main cross
                    street, near the corner of the lot on which William Archer now resides. That well was used by the
                    whole town for a number of years. It measured when completed 87 feet in depth, and was in constant
                         use until about the year 1839 or 1840, when cisterns began
                    to be built in considerable numbers in the town, when the use of the well was dispensed with and
                    filled up.
            Some time about the year 1821 or â€˜22, the exact period not now recollected, a girl of
                    eight or ten years of age, by the name of Elizabeth Hare, being at the well with others to get
                    water, by some accidental misstep lost her balance and fell headlong into this well. The other
                    children who were by the well at the time, were so terrified that they could with difficulty tell
                    what had happened, or who had fallen into the well. Mrs. Dufour was very much alarmed when she
                    learned that a girl had fallen into the well, as her two girls were at the time not to be
                    seenâ€”she imagining that the accident had befallen one of them. A crowd collected, and it
                    was soon ascertained from the affrighted children near the spot, that Elizabeth Hare had fallen into
                    the well. Edward Patten, in the meantime, drew off his coat, boots and socks, and causing the bucket
                    to be lowered into the well, descended by the rope to the bottom, placed the girl in the bucket,
                    fastening her to it in some way, and made signs to draw up, which was done, he following up by
                    holding to the rope with one hand, and sticking his toes into the cracks of the wall, and in that
                    manner reached the top with the girl in an insensible stage. She lingered for some days and then
                    died.
            Some time since there was published in one of the papers published in Vevay a collector's
                    receipt for taxes, perhaps for the year 1818. Here is the copy of a tax receipt given by the sheriff
                    of 
                        Dearborn county
                    , Indiana territory. It is rather a curiosity: 
                        Received of John F. Dufour, his tax in full for the year 1810. 1.00
                        J. Hamilton, Shff.
                  
                    
            
            John 
                        Hamilton
                    , who was the signer of this receipt, was sheriff of 
                        Dearborn county
                     for several years.
            About the year 1811 or 1812 a man by the name of J. F. Buchetee came into New 
                        Switzerland
                    , where he taught school for some time. He was a very good scholar, and a proficient in
                    the dead languages. He composed an ode in Latin, entitled  the
                    Empire of Bacchus, which was translated by a person named William Priestly. The original was in the
                    possession of the writer some time since, but he has mislaid or lost it. The translation of it is
                    here given for the benefit of your readers: 
                        Empire of Bacchus
                  
                        By W. P.
                        
                     
                                Columbia
                             rejoice! Smiling Bacchus has heard Your prayers of so fervent a tone, And
                            crown'd with the grape, has kindly appear'd In your land to establish his
                            throne.
                        This God from Lemana to dull care a foe, Will clothe each rich hill with the
                            vine, And charm'd with the prospect, each bosom shall grow When warm'd
                            with the heart-cheering wine.
                        Let others extol as they quaff the bowl Of the juices Pomana has sent; Be they
                            brandy or rum, which unnerve but the soul, Or whisky, the bane of content.
                        Let us worn with hardships, the vine-dressing Swiss, Who toil the rich cluster
                            to rear, Reap the fruit of past labor and riot in bliss, While we drown in sweet wine every
                            care.
                        Let those who behold us with aspect malign, And denied their assistance of
                            yore, Be debarr'd e'en a drop of the care-soothing wine, And drink water
                            alone evermore.
                        But you who so nobly have tender'd your aid To us, to your country a
                            friend, Approach the gay boardâ€”the full bowl is displayed Drain the
                            gobletâ€”each sorrow unbend.
                        Wine, precious cordial, dispels gloomy cares; Itself is an ocean of wealth. The
                            vigor of body and mind it repairs, And pale sickness it changes to health.
                        
                        O, Friends! Let us drown former cares in the cup, As the mirth-making nectar we
                            drain; Let us toast ruddy Bacchus at each cheering sup, And carol with joy the sweet strain.
                        Blest God, who the soul with fresh spirit inspires And the mind from dull
                            sorrow sets free, Who fans in the bosom Love's ecstatic fires, Full casks we would
                            offer to thee.
                        Great King of the Goblet! Let each fertile hill Delight you, with rich vintage
                            crown'd; O! cherish the vine and the nectar distil, Till each cellar with nectar
                            abound.
                        Subdue for the vine the chill breezes that blow, And screen it from
                            Sol's parching power, And shield the ripe clusters that temptingly glow From
                            Autumn's moist ruinous show'r.
                        Should the frost and the heat and chill rains be remote The vine its red
                            bunches will rear; And each happy soul in the blest juice may float, And quaff
                            nectar'd sweets all the year.
                        Hail Bettens and Morerod! Blest be each name! Sons of Bacchus, your names shall
                            endure; And Siebenthal shall flourish immortal in fame; And you too, vine-rearing Dufour.
                        
                     
                                Columbia
                             will give to true merit its meed Future ages will land you on high, And Libra
                            and Scapio will gladly recede; To yield you a seat in the sky.
                        Redouble your plaudits, blest friends of the glass! For a treasure more
                            precious than gold, We present in the wines which in flavor surpass The Falernian so boasted
                            of old.
                        
                     
                                Columbia
                            , Majestic, in war's garb array'd, Pray the Gods still to
                            prosper the vine; Give thanks to the Swiss, and O! lend them your aid, Who have
                            toil'd to present you with wine.
                    
            
            
            There is neither date or any other mark by which it can be ascertained at what date or at what place
                    the foregoing lines were written, but it is known by some now living, and who attended the school of
                    Mr. J. F. Buchetee, that he was residing here in 
                        Switzerland
                     in 1812 or 1813, and that while here he became acquainted with the Swiss colonists.
                    Hence it is that while here he wrote the poem in Latin entitled "Empire of
                    Bacchus." It is also ascertained that at about the same period of time a person by the name
                    of Priestly came to the colony and remained for a short time. It is also ascertained that Priestly
                    was a good Latin scholar; hence it is thought that he translated this poem while in this colony.
            It is confidently believed that this is the first time this poem has been made public by being
                    published in a newspaper. So if any of the votaries of Bacchus should chance to see and read it, its
                    publication at this time will have performed the mission which its author designed it should. If the
                    original should be found it may yet be given to the public in a future number of these articles.
            Perhaps some account of the company that was chartered by the legislature of Indiana in 1818, by the
                    name of the "
                        Jeffersonville
                        Ohio
                     Canal Company," would not be out of place. That act incorporating the company
                    was passed January 14, 1818, and had for its object the making of a canal around the falls of the 
                        Ohio
                     river, on the Indiana side. The company was organized, a board of directors elected,
                    and James Scott selected as president. The company, by the act of incorporation or some act passed
                    afterwards, was authorized to raise money for the making of said canal by means of a lottery,
                    besides the subscription of stock by individuals. The board of directors appointed agents at all
                    points along the river for the purpose of receiving subscriptions of stock. In April, 1818, they
                    appointed John F. Dufour agent of the company at Vevay to receive subscriptions to the capital stock
                    of the company and the directors also appointed William Cotton and John Gilliland assistants to
                    promote and facilitate the business.
            Subscribers to the stock were required to pay $5 at the time of subscribing. The agent was
                    requested to receipt for monies paid by subscribers and to forward to the president of the board at 
                        Jeffersonville
                     a certified list of subscribers who had paid $5 on each share.
            
            Subscribers thus certified were entitled, at the election for directors on the first Monday of July,
                    1818, to vote either personally or by proxy. What success the agent met with in receiving
                    subscriptions to stock in the company is not now known. It appears from the following letter of
                    instructions to J. F. Dufour that he was also an agent for the sale of lottery tickets for said
                    company:
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                                    
                              
                       Jeffersonville, Dec. 12, â€˜18
                              
                           
                                
                        Sir:
                        The Board of Directors of the J. O. C. Co. have made the following regulation for the
                                    purpose of facilitating the sale of lottery tickets: Ordered that any agent for
                                    selling tickets may sell to any person who may purchase ten tickets or more, on a
                                    credit, taking a negotiable note payable on some good bank provided said bank will
                                    receive said note and pass the amount to the credit of the 
                                        Jeffersonville
                                        Ohio
                                     Canal Company, with assurance that the money will not be drawn from
                                    said bank until the drawing of the lottery shall be completed.
                        
                                    Signed, J. Bigelow, President, Pr.
                                        Tern.
                           
                                
                     
                  
               
                
            
                    
                  
                     
                        H. Webster, Sec'y.
                        
                        It is hoped the above arrangement will have the effect of expediting the lottery. I
                                    am, sir, your ob't sv't.
                        J. Bigelow
                        
                        John F. Dufour, Esq.
                     
                  
               
                
            It appears that the regulation of the board of directors proposing to take notes for lottery tickets
                    sold, succeeded very much to the satisfaction of the directors. As appears from the following letter
                    from the president, J. Bigelow: 
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                                    
                              
                        Jeffersonville,Mar. 14, â€˜18.
                              
                           
                                
                        Dear Sir:
                        Your favor of the 4th inst. came safe to hand. We are happy to see you are succeeding
                                    so well in the sale of tickets. The form of notes you are taking will, I presume,
                                    answer every purpose. The mode we had adopted here is to take them payable on the
                                    last draw of the drawing of the lottery. We shall endeavor to give notice to every
                                    agent when that day will be, for the purpose of facilitating the collection of his
                                    notes. If more tickets are wanting please let us know and we will  send them to you. The first Monday in May is the day
                                    fixed for the commencing the work of the canal.
                        
                                    I am, sir, your friend,
                                    J. Bigelow.
                                    John F. Dufour, Esq.
                                
                     
                  
               
                
            It may satisfy the curiosity of many by giving a sample of the tickets in this lottery. The following
                    is the copy of one of the tickets: 
                        Jeffersonville Ohio Canal Lottery
                  
                        First Class, No. 4,687
                        The holder of this ticket will be entitled to receive such prize as may be drawn to its
                            number in the first class of the J. 0. C. Lottery, if demanded within 12 months after the
                            drawing is finished; subject to a deduction of 15 per cent on all cash paid.
                        Chris. harrison, Manager.
                  
                        Jeffersonville, 1818.
                    
            
            Others of the tickets now before the writer are signed by Samuel Gwathmey, manager.
            The notes given by persons who purchased tickets on a credit read as follows. Copy of one of the
                    notes signed by Laurence Nihell: 
                        $210. Five days after the completion of the drawing of the first class of the J.
                            O. C. Lottery I promise to pay to Wm. Bradley, or order at the office of Discount and
                            Deposit of the Bank of 
                                Vincennes
                            , the State Bank of Indiana, at 
                                Vevay
                            , $210 for value received this 27th day of January A. D., 1819.
                        Laurence Nihell.
                    
            
            This note is endorsed by Wm. Bradley, Robert Burchfield, J. 
                        Hamilton
                    , Jacob Malin, Joseph Malin and Ira Mendenhall.
            Other notes of the same purport are before the writer while writing this account.
            These notes bear different dates, some dated in February, March, April and May, 1819. It would seem
                    that the payment of these notes was never called for, as they remained in the possession of J. F.
                    Dufour, together with tickets not sold, and came to the possession of the writer with other old
                    papers which were thrown aside as waste paper.
            
            About the middle of April, 1818, Mr. Dufour received the following notice from J. Bigelow, chairman
                    of the board of managers of the lottery.
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                                    
                              
                    Jeffersonville,April 10, â€˜18.
                              
                           
                                
                        Sir:
                        The drawing of the Lottery having commenced, it is indispensably necessary that the
                                    managers should received from the agents correct and frequent accounts of the
                                    tickets sold, without which they can form no idea how fast the drawing should
                                    progress. You are, therefore requested to forward immediately a list of tickets sold
                                    by you, and to continue it in future at least once in two weeks. You will please to
                                    let your account show the number of each ticket sold. By order of the Board.
                        
                                    J. Bigelow, Chair'm
                           
                                    John F. Dufour, Esq.
                                
                     
                  
               
                
            A statement of the drawing of the lottery up to the 15th of April, 1818, shows that No. 5,817 drew a
                    prize of $500; No. 1,638, $100; No. 10,118, $50; and 32 other
                    tickets drew each a prize of $5 and 65 other tickets drew each blank.
            A statement of the drawing up to the 20th of April, 1818, shows the drawing of one prize of
                    $50, 14 prizes of $6 each, and 35 blanks.
            In transmitting the last named statement Mr. Bigelow writes to Mr. Dufour the following: 
                        Dear Sir:
                        I enclose you $15 to purchase some Vevay wine, that which is unmixed by any kind
                            of preparation would be preferred. Please get the best you can of that description. It would
                            be better to be put in a cask that had been used for wine before. On the first Monday in
                            next month we commence the canal, and I should be very glad to have a little wine of
                            domestic manufactory to drink on the occasion. If you could possibly get it down here by
                            that time it would be a great favor. Your return of the number of tickets sold is received.
                            I am glad to find you succeeded so well in selling.
                        J. Bigelow.
                  
                        John F. Dufour, Esq.
                    
            
            At the time of transmitting a statement of the fifth drawing Mr. Bigelow acknowledges the receipt of
                    the wine just as they were preparing for dinner.
            Mr. Dufour received the following instructions in regard to unsold tickets:
            
            
                    
                  
                     
                        Dear Sir:
                        The tickets that are drawn and remain unsold in your hands you will, of course, hold
                                    subject to the orders of the managers until your settlement.
                        
                                    Yours respectfully,

                                    John F. Dufour, Esq.
                                
                     
                  
               
                
            The fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh drawings appear to have resulted
                    about as those already given; there being only two prizes of $100 each and one
                    $50 prize drawn while the proportion of blanks are about the same as in former drawings.
            The following was received by Mr. Dufour:
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                                    
                              
                       Jeffersonville,July 1, 1819.
                              
                           
                                
                        Sir:
                        If the ticket No. 4,765 is yet in your hands and unsold you will be so good as to
                                    preserve it for the benefit of the institution as it was drawn on Tuesday last a
                                    prize of $50.
                        
                                    Yours respectfully,
                                    Orlando Raymond,
                                    
                                        Secretary of Board of Managers.
                                    
                                    J. F. Dufour, 
                                            Vevay
                                        .
                                
                     
                  
               
                
            It appears the company by this time began to be looking after the funds due to them for subscriptions
                    of stock and on the sale of tickets by agents. For at a meeting of the board of directors on the
                    21st of September, 1819, the following resolutions were adopted: 
                        
                     Resolved, That the Treasurer of the Board be requested from time to time to
                            take the most effectual step to collect the sums due from the stockholders and the moneys in
                            the hands of the lottery agents, and that he be authorized to appoint an agent or agents for
                            that purpose and that the treasurer of the board of managers be requested forthwith to pay
                            over to the treasurer of the canal company the money remaining in his hands.
                        
                     Resolved, That if the treasurer shall find it necessary to appoint an agent
                            or agents to settle with or collect money from lottery agents, he shall be authorized to
                            empower the agent or agents so appointed by him to sell lottery tickets and to solicit
                            further subscriptions to the capital stock of the company.
                        
                     Resolved, That the treasurer be requested to forward a copy of the
                            resolution of the 7th of December, 1818, relating to the sale of tickets  on a credit to each of the lottery agents, and require their
                            punctual observance of the same; and that they forward certificates of the
                            cashiersâ€™ of the banks in which they may have made deposits in compliance of that
                            resolution.
                    
            
            Samuel Gwathmey, treasurer of the board of directors, appointed Robert Wallace an agent for the
                    purpose of collecting moneys due the company, either on account of sale of lottery tickets or of the
                    subscription of stock in said company. On the 14th of October, 1819, the treasurer notified Mr.
                    Dufour that the drawing of the lottery was progressing weekly, and was expected to continue in that
                    way till completed and that he would be furnished from time to time with a statement of the drawing.
            There does not appear to have been much advance made in the object of the canal company, other than
                    the drawings of the lottery already given in a former number.
            The commencement of the canal was made on the first Monday in May, 1818. At which time there was much
                    eating, drinking and speaking done, but with but little effect so far as the making of the canal was
                    concerned. The canal was commenced, a rod or two, or perhaps more, dug a few feet deep, and then all
                    came to a dead stop. Whether any person made money by the operation or not is not now certainly
                    known.
            It does not appear that any of the notes given for lottery tickets ever were paid or fell into the
                    hands of the managers of the lottery or the treasurer of the canal company.
            In November, 1817, the grand Masonic hall lottery commenced drawing and in December, 1817, William C.
                    Keen gave notice that a few tickets, warranted undrawn could yet be had at the original price of
                    $10. This lottery it is believed, also failed in realizing the expectations of those who
                    had the management of its affairs.
            On the 30th of January, 1818, the Literary Society of Vevay had a meeting at the office of Samuel
                    Merrill, which was convened in pursuance of the notice, and for the purpose set forth in that notice
                    which was as follows: 
                        Question to be discussed by the Literary Society on Thursday evening next at Mr.
                            Merrill's office, 
                                Vevay
                            , "Would it be policy in our 
                            government to form an alliance with the patriots of Mexico and South
                            America?"
                    
            
            January 27, 1818.
            On the 1st of January, 1818, Mr. F. L. Thiebaud being at 
                  Georgetown, Kentucky
               , on
                    business, had the misfortune to have the mare which he rode taken away from him, and on his return
                    to Vevay he caused the following notice to be published in the Indiana Register:
                    
                        The person who, on the evening of the 1st inst., before a public house in 
                                Georgetown
                            , Ky., took a dark bay mare, with a saddle and bridle and left in her stead a
                            bay horse about 4 or 5 years old, with saddle and bridle, is informed that he may get his
                            horse by returning said mare to the subscriber, living three miles below 
                                Vevay
                            , Indiana, who did not discover the exchange until the next morning, being on
                            his way home.
                        Fred L. Thiebaud.
                  
                        The editor of the 
                                Georgetown
                             Patriot will insert the above three times and forward his account to the
                            postmaster at 
                                Vevay
                            , who will pay for the same.
                    
            
            Whether Mr. Thiebaud ever effected an exchange by which he obtained his mare again is not known to
                    the writer.
            In the early settlement of this part of Indiana there was a law of congress in force by which section
                    21, and perhaps section 22, in every congressional township were usually called reserved lands; and
                    the price was fixed on such lands at $4 per acre. Under that law George Turner, who lived
                    on the 
                        Kentucky
                     side of the river above the head of Vevay island, became the purchaser of the
                    south-east quarter of section 21, township 2, range 2. In 1818 he advertised that quarter section of
                    land for saleâ€”requiring one-fourth of the purchase money in hand, the balance at the end
                    of three years with interest.
            Whether he sold that land at that time or soon afterwards is not known, but David Miller became the
                    purchaser of that quarter section of land, but at what date is not known. However some of the heirs
                    of George Turner have lately had a suit pending against David Miller in one of our courts for their
                    interest in the land; as an error was made in selling the interest of said heirs while minors by the
                    guardian, perhaps,  by deeding a different quarter of land in a
                    different section from the quarter and section petitioned to be sold.
            At the time Mr. Turner paid $4 per acre for that land there was equally as good land in
                    the neighborhood to be had at $2 per acre.
            At one time there was in Vevay an ox saw mill, built on the bottom of what is now the corner of Ferry
                    and â€” streets. It was built by two brothers, Robert and Francis Bonner, the former the
                    father of Mrs. Ungles, who was in Vevay at the time of the death of her aunt, Mrs. Margaret
                    Armstrong, the latter was the father of Francis Bonner, who is now residing in Vevay and carrying on
                    the blacksmith business. The mill had a large tread wheel, upon which had to be placed from four to
                    six heavy oxen to cause it to run with sufficient force to do any execution. The mill never did much
                    in the way of sawing lumber, and was built about the year 1818 or 1819.
            About the same time, or perhaps a year later, Judge James Lee, father-in-law of Stephen C. Stevens,
                    came to Vevay and built an ox grist mill on the lot now occupied by Dr. J. W. Thompson, and the lot
                    adjoining thereto. This mill was designed to manufacture all the wheat raised in this part of the
                    county, but proved a failure in every respect. The tread wheel was an enormous wheel, upon which had
                    to be placed some six or eight heavy oxen to run the mill. It never did anything in the manufacture
                    of flour, but proved an unprofitable investment for the owner, and the utter failure in realizing
                    the expectations of Judge Lee.
            Some years afterward Joshua Smithson erected a carding machine on the lot now occupied by John
                    Gill's mill. Mr. Smithson continued the carding business by horse power for some time, and
                    erected a cotton gin, on which he ginned many hundreds of pounds of cotton raised in this
                    neighborhood annually for many years. Finally Mr. Smithson procured a steam engine, and commenced
                    with a grist mill attached to the carding machine. When, sometime in 1834, â€˜35, or
                    â€˜36 he exchanged his mill and all the machinery to Wm. C. Keen for the Printer's
                    Retreat farm.
            
            George G. 
                        Knox
                     after having carried on the cabinet making business for many years, erected a carding
                    machine on the corner of Main and Main cross streets, which he run for some years, and finally
                    attached a grist mill to it on which he made excellent flour.
            Vevay has had many hotels in it since its existence as a town, Robt. M. Trotter being perhaps the
                    first person to keep a house of public entertainment in the townâ€”his exact location the
                    writer has forgotten, but it was either on the lot now owned by Col, Ormsby, and cultivated as a
                    garden, or on the lot owned by John F. Doan, on which he has recently erected his fine residence,
                    and which was about the year 1816 and 1817 occupied by Thomas Armstrong as a tavern stand, until he
                    removed to his new frame on Market street, being the house now occupied by John L. Thiebaud as a
                    residence.
            William T. Huff kept a house of public entertainment in a two story brick on the present site of the
                    Le Clerc House for many years. William Bradley kept the same house in 1819 and 1820, when he removed
                    to a new house erected on the lot corner of Market and Union streets, now owned by John Melcher.
            The two-story brick on the corner of Ferry and Main street, the present site of the LeClerc House was
                    occupied by many others not now recollected except Amos Gilbert, who built the "Russell
                    House," who occupied it from 1827 to about 1832 or â€˜33; when shortly after it
                    was purchased by Robert LeClerc, who occupied it for some years, when he removed it to make place
                    for the present fine building occupied by his widow.
            Jonas Baldwin kept a house of public entertainment in 1817 or â€˜18 at the corner of Market
                    and Ferry streets, in a new frame building he had erected there, and which still stands there, and
                    is now owned by Mrs. Elizabeth Dalmazzo, widow of Joseph Dalmazzo.
            In the early days of the settlement of 
                        Vevay
                    , and until perhaps in 1825 and â€˜26 it was customary for families to have the
                    shoes and clothing for the family made up at home. In order to have this done calfskins, upper and
                    sole leather was purchased and taken home a shoemaker engaged to come to  the house and take the measure for all shoes to be made for each member
                    of the family; and in the course of about two weeks shoes for a whole family of six or eight persons
                    would be finished, to last them for the whole year. In like manner cloth, thread and buttons were
                    bought and taken home, a tailor engaged to come to the house and cut and make the necessary clothes
                    for the men and boys for the whole year. In this manner the writer remembers well when his father
                    would, in the fall, bring in the stock of leather and cloth, and say that the shoemaker and tailor
                    would come perhaps the next week to make the shoes, coats, vests and pantaloons for the family. The
                    price paid the shoemaker was about $8 or $10 a week, and the tailor about the
                    same, and perhaps a little less. Oh, how the good old times have changed.
            As has been stated in a former number, that during the early settlement of the Swiss colony and for
                    some years afterwards, there was but one physician, Charles Muret. It is believed he was perhaps the
                    only physician in the settlement until about the year 1813 or 1814, when a Dr. Norton came to Vevay
                    and commenced the practice of medicine.
            The next physician who came to the town was Dr. John Mendenhall, who came in 1815 or 1816, who
                    commenced the practice of his profession and had quite an extensive and lucrative practice for many
                    years, in fact until his age prevented him from paying attention to calls from the country any
                    distance from town, and going about at night.
            About the year 1816 or 1817, Dr. James Welch, who was also a Presbyterian minister, came to 
                        Vevay
                    , bringing with him a large stock of dry goods. He commenced the mercantile business, as
                    also the practice of his medical profession, preaching on the Sabbath in the court house. About the
                    year 1818 or â€˜19 he built the large brick building corner of Market and Main cross
                    streets. One room in the corner of the main building was occupied as a storeroom, the one
                    immediately in its rear being used as the counting-room, and one room in the ell as a drug store;
                    the latter being attended to by his son, Geo. W. Welch, who died about the year 1820. Dr. Welch, it
                    was said, was in the habit of using intoxicating liquors as a beverage to excess, and often has the
                    writer heard him tell his  congregation from the pulpit during
                    his sermons, "Do as I tell you, and not as I do." Referring no doubt to his habit
                    of using intoxicating drinks frequently to excess. Be that as it may, the church judicature
                    instituted proceedings against him sometime in 1825 or â€˜26 and after an investigation of
                    the case he was silenced as a minister, and shortly afterwards died, as was said by some, from
                    mortification at the decision made against him.
            The judicature that condemned Dr. Welch was presided over by Joshua L. Wilson, of 
                        Cincinnati
                    , who was so long connected with the First Presbyterian church at 
                        Cincinnati
                    .
            Dr. Edward Stall, a regular physician, formerly from 
                        Baltimore
                    , came to Vevay soon after and remained for several years. He finally left and removed
                    to 
                        Cincinnati
                    . One of his daughters married a Mr. Wolf and resides in 
                        Rushville
                    , in this state. Her husband was in the service during the rebellion and was killed or
                    died. A son, who is at present or was a short time since auditor of Rush county, was also in the
                    service and served as an officer with distinguished honor to himself and the cause he espoused.
            The year 1820 was a very sickly year along the water courses in the West, and Vevay did not escape
                    from the sad effects of sickness during the latter part of the summer and fall of that year. It was
                    estimated that the population of the town and the immediate vicinity (say between Indian and Plumb
                    creeks, in the bottom, between the river and the foot of the hill) at that time numbered about 600
                    souls. For during the spring of that year great numbers of persons came down the river in small
                    flatboats, mostly from Olean Point, seeking a home in this part of the country; many stopping at 
                        Vevay
                    , in fact, so many that every house in the place was filled to overflowing. In many
                    instances two and three families, with from four to six souls in each family, were crowded into a
                    small tenement. As a natural consequence, when sickness once entered one of these crowded tenements
                    none escaped and in many instances out of from eight to twelve in one of these crowded tenements,
                    there would not be one left well enough to attend those that were sick; and, as might be  expected, many died from want of proper attention who perhaps would
                    otherwise have lived.
            Truman Richards, a young lawyer from the state of 
                        New York
                    , an estimable young man, who was writing for J. F. Dufour in the clerk's
                    office, fell a victim to the dreadful scourge. His estate was administered on by Dr. William
                    Stephenson, a brother-in-law of Judge Stephen C. Stevens. The interest in the estate was sold by the
                    heirs who resided in 
                        New York
                     to Jonathan Hawkins, the father of Ainsworth Hawkins and Mrs. Rosetta Ransom. By this
                    sale of the estate by the heirs there is nothing to be seen standing in the graveyard to mark where
                    his remains were deposited, save, perhaps a rough lime stone with the letter R roughly cut on it.
                    This ought not be thus, for Mr. Richards was a most estimable young man, and his remains deserve a
                    better memorial. But, as he died in a strange land among strangers, far away from home and friends,
                    it cannot be expected to be otherwise.
            It might be proper here to state that instead of there being but two lawyers or attorneys at law
                    buried in the Vevay cemetery, there are certainly known to be four: Truman Richards, James M. Kyle,
                    Aurelius W. Dumont and Robert Drummond. The three latter of whom many of your readers, especially in 
                        Switzerland county
                     will doubtless recollect.
            Among those who it is recollected dealt out the "0 be joyful" to their thirsty
                    customers in 
                        Vevay
                    , within the recollection of the writer, may be mentioned; Frederick and Otis Waldo, who
                    kept their shop at the corner of Ferry and Market streets for several years, when they commenced
                    keeping dry goods. The latter was the father of 0. S. and F. J. Waldo and the former was their
                    grandfather.
            Edward Patton, who kept whisky, cider and wine to sell by the "small" in a log
                    house opposite to the residence of J. L. Thiebaud on Market street, and on the lot on which 0. S.
                    Waldo's residence stands.
            
               
                        Israel
                     R. Whitehead had an establishment on the lot where Mathias Madary now resides. He also
                    had a bakery, which was attended to in the mechanical department of Mr. Madary for a few years, when
                    Mr. Madary bought the house and lot  and set up for himself, and
                    carried on a thriving business in the bakery and retailing liquors.
            An anecdote worthy of relating took place about this time: A law had been enacted by the legislature
                    of Indiana requiring the boards doing county business to procure and keep in the office of the clerk
                    of the county a standard of weights and measures. These had been procured and placed in possession
                    of Edward Patton, who was then clerk of the county. One day the clerk visited some of the shops and
                    places where liquors were sold at retail, not by the drink, but by the gill, half-pint, etc. Calling
                    in at Mr. Madary's the clerk informed him that he had called to try his weights and
                    measures. And as the glasses on the counter and shelves were third pints instead of half-pints, Mr.
                    Madary called on his wife to bring him the "big tumblers." It is useless to say
                    anything further of this matter than that it was a joke gotten up by the clerk for his own sport.
            Later years brought upon the stage as retailers of spiritous liquors as a beverage, William Shaw and
                    Ladig Rous, who were in their day the most popular caterers to the appetites of their numerous
                    customers, who could be counted by hundreds, in arranging mint juleps, Tom and Jerry, Irish and
                    Italian punch, etc. During their continuance in that business they were very successful and made
                    considerable money, and eventually abandoned that business which was carried on at the corner of
                    Ferry and Main streets, where J. C. Well's store is kept, but in a different building, and
                    entered into the dry goods and grocery business.
            Percy Rous was also engaged in the retail liquor trade in this place, and from appearances did a
                    tolerably fair business, but did not continue at it for any considerable length of time.
            Many others have been engaged in the retail liquor trade in 
                        Vevay
                    , who have left long since, and who did not make much of a mark in the business. Some of
                    our most prominent business men have at some time during their lives been engaged in the business.
            There is perhaps no business on which the opinion of many persons has undergone so radical a change
                    as the business of  retailing spirituous liquors. Many who were
                    engaged in it, and secured quite a competency of this world's goods, thought it a laudable
                    business and respected those engaged in it as men of good moral character and good citizens, now
                    hold the opinion that no man of good moral character will engage in the
                    "iniquitous" traffic.
