                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the state of Indiana was void of organizations devoted to scientific study and
                    research. Several associations were attempted throughout the state, but their influence was entirely
                    local. None of them attained reputation, prominence, or accomplishment comparable to that of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Society of Natural History, organized in 1881 by Amos W. Butler.</p>
            <p>The founding of the society was inspired by Rufus Haymond, the first productive zoologist in Indiana
                    after Thomas Say, "Father of American Zoology," who died at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>

                    </placeName> to visit a distant relative and decided to start his practice there. His motive for
                    staying is not easily understood since the settlement of <placeName>

                    </placeName> was suffering a severe economic depression at that time. The most probable explanation
                    is that he had a keen interest in nature and found the region an ideal locality for the exercise of
                    this interest.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Haymond recorded his observations on nature in two publications. The first of these
                    was a treatise on ornithology, titled "Birds of Southeastern Indiana." It was
                    published in the <hi rend="i">Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of <placeName>

            <p>Haymond's publications were valuable, they brought him deserved attention as a scientist,
                    but his contribution as an inspiration to others of the community was of more lasting worth. That he
                    recognized the significance which his influence might have was indicated in the introduction of the

                    Presbyterian minister, David R. Moore, who was born at Rising Sun, Indiana, on January 9, 1850. He
                    graduated from Miami University in 1871, Lane Theological Seminary in 1875, and <placeName>

                    scientific, he stimulated others in that direction. To promote greater interest, he invited those
                    who wished to expand and exchange their information to meet at his home for informal discussions.
                    The group held occasional lectures in the Presbyterian church, and the attendance became so large
                    that Butler conceived the idea of a formal organization. After discussing the venture with Moore, <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Moore suggested the plan to the group at one of the meetings. The proposal was met
                    with such enthusiasm that a special meeting was called on January 12, 1881, at Moore's
                    residence. At that meeting action was taken immediately to elect officers. Moore was elected
                    president, Charles F. Goodwin, a prominent young banker, vice-president, <placeName>

            <p>The society offered its services to the public and asked that it be made the depository for all
                    material which might be included in a museum to benefit the public. It also scheduled a number of
                    formal lectures. Among the prominent lecturers who addressed the group were David Starr <placeName>

            <p>The society became extremely active. One year after its founding <placeName>

                    to visualize the possibility of a state organization. He started to correspond with all the

                    </placeName> in 1886, and Haymond, who died on July 29, 1886. Gradually the fibers of the society
                    pulled apart. For five years it had been an extremely active and valuable organization, but it lost
                    impetus and distintegrated rather rapidly as more emphasis and attention were given to the broader
                    scope of the Indiana Academy of Science. Probably the main cause of its distintegration was that the
                    constitution stated that any person in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName> was eligible to be a resident member of the organization; consequently, the society
                    gained members who were not scientifically trained. The third and last of the bulletins of the <placeName>

                    the material in the museum was returned to the donors or dispersed in other ways. The last meeting
                    was held in 1890 or 1891 despite conscientious efforts for its revival.</p>

                    although dealing specifically with the Northwest Territory served as the model for most subsequent
                    territorial governments, a new territory was launched as a first or nonrepresentative stage of
                    government without any popular voice in the selection of territorial officials.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                    This level continued until an increased population made possible an advance to the second or
                    representative stage of government with a popularly elected House of Representatives.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Statehood was the final step in the transition from territory to equal membership in the
                    Union. As the territorial frontier swept westward, the democratic impulse, especially strong in the
                    frontier area, soon made the process decidedly more democratic.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>Indiana remained at the representative stage from late in 1804 until statehood was achieved in 1816,
                    during which period the total territorial expenditures averaged approximately ten thousand dollars
                        yearly.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> About two-thirds of this sum was paid from federal appropriations
                    leaving one-third payable from territorial revenues. While at the nonrepresentative level,
                    territorial costs had totaled about $5,700 annually with all but two hundred dollars
                    being provided from the federal treasury.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The meagerness of these totals, especially when the extent of the federal subsidy is considered, is
                    indicative of the fiscal atmosphere in which Indiana became a state. It was generally understood
                    that this federal support would be lost if territorial days were ended. while it was also recognized
                    that statehood would result in added costs. The ensuing discussion has several references to these
                    points of view. With this picture before us, the fiscal aspect of the statehood contest can be
                    observed more nearly from the contemporary perspective and the movement cannot be properly
                    understood in any other manner. Such objectivity is particularly hard to achieve in these days when
                    fiscal expenditures have towered skyward until millions and even billions are spent with less
                    caution and care than the founding fathers of Indiana spent thousands or even hundreds of
                        dollars.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>General Johnston, who voted for the petition, wrote Indiana citizens hazarding the opinion that
                    Congress would grant the prayer of the Assembly because of the reduction of congressional
                    expenditures which would flow therefrom.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Johnston was, no doubt, referring to
                    the end of federal appropriations for certain territorial salaries and a contingent fund which would
                    cease with statehood. His prediction was inaccurate, however, a select committee of the lower house
                    of Congress, headed by Territorial Delegate Jonathan Jennings, reported a resolution favoring
                    statehood whenever the population reached thirty-five thousand as determined by a territorial

            <p>The War Of 1812 apparently checked and delayed agitation for statehood. During the years 1812 and
                    1813, the thoughts and efforts of the people of Indiana were beamed on defense from the Indians and
                    their British allies, although by the end of 1814 the war clouds were dispersing and the immediate
                    future promised a considerable impetus to population and fiscal resources. The Assembly provided for
                    an 1815 territorial census to discover whether. the number of inhabitants totaled a minimum of sixty
                    thousand as required for statehood by the Ordinance of 1787.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> In the summer of

                            from territory to state lowered the governor's salary from two thousand to one
                            thousand dollars annually. Previous discussion has indicated that during territorial days
                            such salaries were paid from the federal treasury, however, statehood transferred such
                            expense to the Indiana treasury.</item>

                    consider taxes "too high," but present day Hoosiers may well wonder what shackles
                    then burdened industry. Apparently, the then odious excise taxes which the federal government had
                    reluctantly revived during the war of 1812 were the target of this criticism.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The most complete and best organized of the available statements against statehood came from the pen
                    of "Republican" who addressed his thoughtful remarks "To The Citizens of
                    Indiana." His identity is unknown but he was strongly opposed to Jennings.
                    "Republican's" appeal appeared in the <hi rend="i">Western Sun</hi> about
                    one week prior to the convening of the constitutional convention and may have been timed to
                    influence the delegates to decide against framing a constitution as the next step on the road to
                    statehood. "Republican" viewed the crisis as one which seldom occurred and
                    confined his argument largely to the fiscal issue, making no other objection to statehood.</p>
            <p>Although taxes in support of the territorial government were heavy, statehood would cause these
                    burdens to be doubled,<hi rend="sup">35</hi> while by remaining a territory money could be saved to
                    citizens where it was much needed in settling a new country. Indianans were urged to attend for a
                    while to "the opening, clearing, and cultivation of their farms, have a surplus produce for
                    market, invite emigrants, &amp; then we shall be able to pay our state revenue without the
                    sheriff's taking our childrens bread." After such delay the people of Indiana
                    could enter the Union as wise men, but its immediate assumption would result in the tax exemption of
                    all lands sold by the federal government within Indiana for five years from the date of sale; make
                    the salaries of the governor, judges and secretary payable from state rather than federal revenues;
                    and result in additional expense because of more offices. If the territorial government were

                    early settlers, and finally the establishment of towns, cities, and states, is the growth of water
                    transportation, which is interesting and fascinating of itself. As a boy, I listened with wide eyes
                    to stories of Indians in canoes skimming swiftly and silently on the stream which had been taken up
                    by large and noisy steamboats with heavy cargoes of passengers and freight, or of the large war
                    canoes manned by twenty or thirty painted savages making a surprise attack on other tribes. Then, as
                    soon as the white man appeared, the Indians turned their cruel warfare against him, and many tales
                    were told of ambush, fighting, and massacres. The historic Pigeon Roost Massacre had occurred not
                    far away, while the ambush and slaying of Colonel Archibald Laughery and about one hundred officers
                    and men at the mouth of the stream, which now bears his name, was almost in sight of my birthplace,
                    and Laughery Island was less than two miles distant. I was thrilled by accounts of a few men who
                    escaped and who had nerve wracking experiences when Indians searched for them in thickets and hills.
                    One soldier, though severely injured, managed to swim to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> side where he found a hiding place by squeezing into a crevice of Split Rock where he
                    lay for two or three days while Indians passed within a few yards of him, and he could see their
                    feet and legs when one or two remained absolutely still while the others noisily took their canoes
                    out on the river. They finally gave up and he escaped.</p>
            <p>My boyhood was spent on a farm below Rising Sun, Indiana, where my parents moved while I was quite
                    young. I always liked to watch the river and sometimes climbed a large sycamore tree on the
                    riverbank where I spent many pleasant hours watching boats pass or just watching the eddies in <pb n="324" id="VAA4025-042-4-028"/> the current and the driftwood as it floated slowly
                    along—seeing in boyish imagination the craft of years long gone, the canoes of bark or of
                    hollowed logs, and the boats of the early settlers and explorers. The white man had first come as
                    explorer and trader, then came settlers. There were no roads at first and the blazed trails were
                    often hard to follow, and much of the time they were impassable, so on this account and also the
                    dangers from wild beasts and savage Indians, the early travelers turned to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                            but there was no impetuous hurry on the part of the future settlers to beat the clock, as,
                            mentally, they were resigned and easy-going and deliberate as the current which bore them

            <p>Among the craft employed in 1800 were two contrasting types. One was called the keelboat while the
                    other was named the flatboat. Keelboats varied in size from small ones, five or six feet in width
                    and twenty to thirty feet long and with sharp bow and stern, to large ones up to 120 feet in length.
                    On the small keelboats there was a narrow running board on each side. These were used by the crew to
                    pole their boats upstream when they were unable to cordelle them. It required from six to ten men to
                    force the boat upstream. Half of the crew was on either side of the boat. Each man was given a long
                    pole. "They set their poles at the head of the boat, brought the end of the pole to their
                    shoulder, bent over, and walked on the running boards to the stern. At the captain's order
                    they returned quickly to the head for a new start."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Such boats, under

                    constructed on the order of ocean craft and were built by trained shipbuilders. They were made with

                    and this gave them their name. Such boats were usually from sixty to ninety feet long and a few even
                    larger were built. Though narrow, these boats were quite commodious and could carry much freight as
                    well as a number of passengers, who rode very comfortably. These boats had oars and usually carried
                    removable running boards so that poles could be used if necessary. Poling was slow and required a
                    large crew. These large keelboats were expensive to build, expensive to operate, and by the ordinary
                    citizen regarded as aristocrat, which did not appeal to the hardy frontiersmen.</p>
            <p>Most pioneers had very little capital, but possessed ambition, industry and courage. They soon
                    developed a very simple craft which required neither skilled labor nor blue prints to construct. At
                    first log rafts were constructed, sometimes with small cabins to protect the travelers and their
                    household goods from the weather. Occasionally, in all emergency such a craft came apart. They then
                    devised a simple boat with square sides and a flat bottom, and they called it a flatboat. This plain
                    craft with the simple name became the boat cf the common people just as the early Ford car was known
                    much later as the car of the common folks. On small flatboats family groups or several families from
                    the same community came down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River to settle, clear the land, build homes, and thus set up an inland empire. One
                    such boat is said to have had 105 people aboard, all members of the Anderson family, as told me by a
                    grandson, E. A. Anderson, now almost ninety years of age. He said that two boats came all the way
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> and landed at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. The other boat had over seventy persons on it belonging to three families,
                    Matthew, Saultzman, and Wilson. There are many descendants of these families still living in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey County</region>
                    </placeName>. The lives of these early settlers doubtless seemed commonplace to them, and few
                    pioneers realized the importance of their efforts. Yet, like the laborers on the temple at
                    Jerusalem, who were commended for their faithfulness and fidelity, so these pioneers were laying the
                    foundation of orderly government all through the <placeName>

            <p>In a short time, land had been cleared and abundant crops raised so that larger markets were needed.
                    Learning that the people in the South raised only two or three crops, such <pb n="326" id="VAA4025-042-4-030"/> as cotton and sugar cane, and that they needed staple food crops for

                    </placeName> took advantage of the situation and began to build flatboats which were familiar to
                    them. Men with capital to invest had larger boats built and employed reliable and experienced men to
                    take them down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    </placeName> where they disposed of their cargoes and then sold the boats.</p>
            <p>About the time the flatboating era began to develop another factor also entered the situation. A
                    steamboat came puffing and clanging down the river from <placeName>

                    </placeName> River to the development of other than the material interests of the Midwest. A large,
                    fine keelboat came gaily around the bend above Rising Sun one fine day in December, 1825. This boat
                    landed and several well-dressed men and women came ashore and introduced themselves to the folks who
                    were gathering to see them and their boat. One of them, Robert Dale Owen, explained that his father,
                    Robert Owen, of <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>, had purchased the community known as Harmonie, Indiana, located about fifty miles up
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Harmonie had been established in 1814 by a religious group under the leadership of
                    George Rapp who expected to live to see the second coming of Christ. This town, on the banks of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, had been constructed with unusually substantial and commodious buildings, land had
                    been cleared, large fields put under cultivation, orchards and vineyards set out, and sheep, goats,
                    hogs, and cattle for dairy and beef were raised. Several industries had also been set up. Above all
                    stood the great church in the form of a Maltese cross which had been constructed with unsually fine
                    skill in design and workmanship. The Harmonie Society and community had been organized as a
                    co-operative group with all sharing equally. Since their markets were too far away and too hard to
                    reach, they had sold to Robert Owen and had removed to a place they had selected in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>

                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Robert Owen and William Maclure, who had joined him, intended to establish free
                    schools including kindergartens, trade schools, and the sciences Among the passengers were Thomas
                    Say, who afterwards became famous as a scientist, and Lucy Sistaire, who later married Say. She was
                    an unusually talented artist and made drawings which she embelished and also paintings of shell fish
                    which Thomas Say collected and classified. Others included two other sons of Robert Owen, Richard
                    Dale Owen and David Dale Owen, and also Joseph Neef and family. When William Maclure first met Neef,
                    he was principal of a large school in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Maclure engaged him to have charge of the schools, and his contract stipulated that he
                    would be granted an annuity upon retirement. On the keelboat were many valuable books, scientific
                    equipment, household goods, and unusual articles, such as a clock with rotating pendulum which was
                    more than one hundred years old at that time. Though the Owen community as planned was not a
                    success, yet the young men and women who went there to organize schools had a great influence on the
                    intellectual development of the Midwest. One of Robert Owen's sons became the first
                    president of Purdue University, and one of the buildings at Indiana University is named Owen Hall in
                    honor of Richard Dale Owen, who was a professor in the university several years. The unusual
                    character of the sons of Robert Owen is shown in an unusual way at the capitol building of Indiana
                    where there are two memorials, each placed there by voluntary contributions of many people. One is a
                    monument on the statehouse grounds, which was placed there by the women of Indiana and the nation to
                    honor Robert Dale Owen for the efforts he had made, and with considerable success, for the rights of
                    women. The other is a large plaque which is in the rotunda of the building and was furnished by the
                    voluntary contributions of former Confederate prisoners of war in Camp Morton of which Colonel
                    Richard Owen was commandant. The inscription reads: "In honor of Col. Richard Dale Owen who
                    was more like a father than a jailor to us."</p>
            <p>The work of writing this brief story of the flatboat era was suggested to me by James G. Daly, whose
                    grandfather, <pb n="329" id="VAA4025-042-4-033"/> Captain Jim Daly, was a flatboatman practically
                    all his life. When I taught in Rising Sun High School, James Daly was in some of my classes, and we
                    became quite good friends. Unexpectedly, James Daly turned the tables on his former English teacher
                    by assigning me the task of writing an essay about the flatboat period. Captain Jim Daly had made
                    his first trip when Indiana was just a new state and carried on until about the last flatboat was to
                    leave Rising Sun when he became ill. His son came to bring him home on a steamboat, but by some
                    accident Captain Jim fell from the steamboat as they were about to land at home, and he sank from
                    sight—his body was never recovered. He had spent his entire life building flatboats,
                    loading them, and piloting them to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> and other places down the river, then finally, the water of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River closed over him, and the river became his final resting place.</p>
            <p>I was flattered when I was chosen to write the article on flatboats, but when I began to check upon
                    my stock of information on the subject, I realized that it was woefully brief and indefinite. When I
                    began to look for some one to hell) me, I was exceptionally fortunate to find two friends who have
                    done so much that they should have most of the credit for the story as it now appears. One is Mrs.
                    Lucie Rieman. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Aurora</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, whose father was a flatboat pilot. She made several trips to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> when she was a child. The other is Mrs. Abby May Espey <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>, Rising Sun, Indiana, whose family had been in the flatboat business for many years.
                    She had seen the activities of building large boats each year and the work and organized hustle and
                    bustle of loading them as quickly as possible in order to get them on their way before the earliest
                    freeze could catch them. These two friends gave the information and with it a personal touch. Mrs.
                    Warren arranged a meeting of her brother, Stewart Espey, and Clarence Bedgood, who had also been
                    actively engaged in the flatboat business in the period following the Civil War. One was eighty-six
                    years old and the other eighty-seven. Espey did not make many trips, — but helped manage
                    the large business until it ceased to be profitable in the late eighties. Bed-good spent many years
                    on smaller coasting boats or on shop-boats. These two old-timers recalled that when they were small
                    boys they became involved in a fight. Mrs. Bloss, who had an ice cream parlor was just bringing the
                    brine from <pb n="330" id="VAA4025-042-4-034"/> freezing a batch of cream and was about to empty it
                    into the gutter, but when she saw the fight she threw the brine on them. Hostilities ceased
                    immediately, and they never had another fight. We are very fortunate indeed to have the story
                    directly from these two veterans as well as from others who were actually in the business.</p>
            <p>The first flatboats were not very large, many of them not much larger than houseboats, but as
                    opportunities opened and larger boats were needed the same plan was used and the proportions were
                    about the same. In the first years of the steamboat, there was considerable rivalry between the
                    different crews but as the years passed and steamboats were improved flatboat men often had a
                    steamboat tow their boat back home loaded with goods to be sold in the home stores. Empty flatboats,
                    however, usually sold readily just for the lumber in them because lumber was scarce in the South at
                    that time and those flatboats were made of fine northern timber, oak, yellow poplar, and other
                    kinds. And so there was a steady stream of flatboats passing down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> each fall and out into the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. Since very few were brought back, new ones had to be built each year.</p>
            <p>When James Daly wrote to me concerning the article I was to prepare, he gave me considerable
                    information about the flatboat. Though younger than myself, Daly had seen many flatboats, and once
                    his father moved his family 250 miles down the river from Rising Sun to Alton, Indiana, on a
                    flatboat loaded to go down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. James, though only a boy, had helped run this boat so there was Captain Jim Daly, his
                    son Garret, and his grandson James on the same flatboat crew. James G. Daly wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The Flat Boat was distinctly a development of the early pioneers. It was square at both ends
                            and absolutely flatbottomed. The two ends rounded up, as you will remember, and the bottom
                            was nailed on crosswise and there was nothing on the bottom at all to keep it from going in
                            any direction that it pleased. It had oars on the sides that were managed from the roof and
                            were called "sweeps" and they had one oar on each end—on the
                            rear end they called it the steering oar and on the other end the gouger. That was used to
                            throw the boat in any direction they wanted to go when they had to make a sudden change. It
                            took a lot of strength to manage a gouger, because the boat was drifting down on to that oar
                            and when they dipped into the water to take a bite of it they just had to fairly lift the
                            boat sidewise from the end. They needed this in order to avoid snags, trees and stumps and
                            all the other things that you tell about in your story.</p>

                        <p>These boats were small in the beginning, of course, but they grew into very great boats. Some
                            of them that left the landing in <placeName>

                            real power to run them. There would be two sweeps on each side of them with three men to a
                            sweep and two men on the gouger and one on the steering oar. They cut a piece of a tree and
                            brought it up from the very bottom of the boat clear to the top for a check post about which
                            they would let the roap slide when they wanted to slow the boat down and they had one of
                            them at each end. They had platforms across the boat to manage the steering oar and the
                            gouger and other platforms along the sides to manage the sweeps, with the men walking on the
                            left side of the boat to manage the sweep on the right side, because it was long and
                            balanced and had to have a lot of room to operate. With the aid of these oars they could
                            take the boat almost any place they pleased. They also always had a mast erected on them
                            with a sail that they could use when the weather was windy enough to carry the boat along,
                            but not windy enough to make it unmanageable. These boats were built up with heavy planks on
                            the sides to a height of about five feet and from that mark on up they were built of
                            ordinary ship lap siding until they were about eight feet on the sides and perhaps ten feet
                            in the middle with a ridge pole and stanchion that went down through there and then they
                            took green lumber and laid the boards crosswise and nailed them on the sides and nailed them
                            off straight and then covered that with tarred paper and laid another row of boards, lapping
                            the joints so it would not leak. In the rear end they built a "fan-tail"
                            which was nothing more than a sort of platform out there on which the house of convenience
                            was located and the cabin or the place where the men slept and ate was just inside of that
                            They had a stove in there and a table and a kitchen and bunks along the wall and that gave
                            an entry out to the boat proper where the cargo was stored and another one to the rear of
                            the boat to the steps that came up onto the top when the cry of "Oars"
                            came from the pilot.</p>

                    especially when several men were working at the same time. Even when carefully calked, the hulls
                    would leak some. In order to protect the cargo as well as to protect the bottom from being knocked
                    loose by the cargo, a floor was laid a few inches above the bottom. To take care of the leakage,
                    hand pumps were put in. These as well as the entire construction of the flatboat, were very simple.
                    They had wooden tubes about four inches square and all valves were of wood and leather. To make the
                    job of pumping easier spring poles were placed to pull the piston stem up, so about all the men had
                    to do was to push down as it almost raised itself.</p>

                            father, there were seven men who all became successful business men in <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Aurora</settlement>
                            </placeName>. They were Langtree, McGuire, William Mabin, Andy Winkley, Edson Winkley, Hy
                            Cox, and my Uncle George <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Mitchell</settlement>
                            </placeName>. Some others from <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Aurora</settlement>
                            </placeName> were Abram Hill, grandfather of Edwin C. Hill, Jacob Harbaugh, Asa Hubbard, and
                            Aaron Huffman. It was considered quite the thing, in a cultural way, to take the trip to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                            </placeName>. The last trips from <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Aurora</settlement>
                            </placeName> were made in 1893 when flatboating ceased to be a profitable business. The
                            flatboat was like a barge with sides built up and roofed, with two oars on each side and one
                            at each end. These oars were used to keep it in the channel because if it grounded there was
                            no way to get it afloat again. Not many boats were built at <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Aurora</settlement>
                            </placeName> but were built above here, probably at <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                            </placeName>, but they were brought here to be finished, equipped, and loaded. A cabin, also
                            used as a kitchen, was built at the bow of the boat and another at the stern for bunks.
                            There was a slightly elevated bottom as all flatboats leaked more or less, but hand pumps
                            took care of that. A spar at each end of the boat was used to keep it away from the bank,
                            but I might add, if there was a heavy wind the squeaking of those spars were not music,
                            especially if you wanted to sleep. Now as to our cargo; we went 8 or 10 miles down to Rising
                            Sun, passing Laughery Creek, Split Rock, and the home of your grandfather, Captain Tom Pate,
                            who lived in a large brick house opposite the head of Laughery Island. Farther down we
                            rounded a bend and came to Rising Sun. Here we stopped and took on many barrels of apples
                            and potatoes. We then went on, stopping at other places to take on hay, corn, flour, meal,
                            dried fruits and various other things which my father knew he could sell at a profit. At
                            some larger <pb n="333" id="VAA4025-042-4-037"/> places he laid in supplies of such things
                            as green coffee, navy beans and staple groceries — which had a market along the
                            coast, as the <placeName>

                            </placeName> yet we stopped at a number of places and sold our miscellaneous supplies,
                            especially where coasting boats had landed for years. At these points, below <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
                            </placeName>, many white folks patronized us but there were more colored people who bought
                            our goods. It was slow traveling and a rather lazy life and a happier group of men would be
                            hard to find. The scenery along the <placeName>

                                <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                            </placeName> rivers is very beautiful. At <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Rockport</settlement>
                            </placeName> we bought two well built skiffs which were a great convenience to us and when
                            we got to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                            </placeName> we sold them for more than they had cost. When we wanted to land or any of the
                            men went ashore they used these skiffs. To land they took the large rope to shore and
                            fastened it to a tree or other solid object and then, by means of the check post, would land
                            our boat. Our last landing to take on cargo was at Cairo, <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                            </placeName>, where they shot bales of hay and sacks of oats down a long chute to the
                            deck—it was quite exciting to me to see this. The boats left <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Aurora</settlement>
                            </placeName> about the middle of September each year so they could get to the <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                            </placeName> before ice began to form, but it got us at Cairo one trip and the men took pike
                            poles and pushed the larger cakes away to keep them from making holes in the hull. On one
                            trip our boat sprung a leak while we were passing through the locks at <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                            </placeName> so we had to stop right there to take care of it. The men who operated the
                            locks were irritated and mother was worried but she took the rag carpet up from the cabin
                            floor for calking and saved the day. The lock keeper.; did not use very nice language and
                            father was pretty sore, as it was not his fault; but it soon became just another anecdote of
                            the flatboating business. When we neared <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                            </placeName> the little sail boats with dagoes selling oranges and bananas or oysters and
                            shrimp were a welcome sight because I was tired of eating pies made of dried apples, dried
                            prunes, or dried peaches. When we landed at <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                            </placeName> a tug boat towed us to the landing right beside an ocean going vessel. When we
                            disposed of our cargo and sold our boat we attended the wonderful Cotton Exposition. To me,
                            however, about all I recall seeing were the Liberty bell and Peter Cooper's first
                            steam engine. Returning by train I got a real thrill crossing Lake Ponchatrain on a long
                            trestle and for a time we were out of sight of land. But when we reached <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                            </placeName> in February, 1883, we found the <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                            </placeName> River having the greatest flood of its history, and which, for many years, we
                            supposed to be the all time high water. Hut in 1937 we were sadly disillusioned when the
                            1884 flood was topped by several feet; so now we wonder if the all time high has finally
                            been reached. Rut modern flood control measures will be carried nut before many years, I am
                            sure. The following fall we went again and at that time I saw the Mardi Gras which so
                            impressed me that I am thrilled at the memory of that gorgeous parade. In closing I want to
                            say that my father made several trips to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                            </placeName> and had his boat towed back. The Wymonds had a large cooper shop in <placeName>

                            </placeName>. These were as much as 25 feet wide by 125 feet long. The material used was oak
                            and yellow poplar. The boats were all built locally though the heavier bottom planks were
                            usually obtained from <placeName>

                            boats the pilot guided by trees, local land marks, hills and the like, as there were no
                            government lights then. Also there were many obstructions which were later removed by the
                            government. Many of the smaller boats were built in large creeks and loaded by farmers in
                            the vicinity as a co-operative enterprise, which may have helped spread the idea of farm
                            co-operatives as we now have them. And some of the farm boys who raised the crops also
                            helped build the flatboats and later made the trip down the river. One such place was <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Hartford</settlement>
                            </placeName>, on Laughery Creek, which boasted a "ship yard" for many
                            years. This traffic by farmers was largely before the Civil War. My father commenced
                            flatboating when about twenty years of age. Afterwards, for many years, he loaded and sent
                            flatboats each year but did not himself make the trips. However I remember when I was a
                            little child my father had two flatboats that were caught in early river ice. They were
                            saved but the danger made all the crew leave with the exception of one man. This man saved a
                            heavy loss because flatboats which had been abandoned could be siezed and claimed by law. It
                            seems strange there were so few flatboats lost for the hazards were great and there was a
                            rather heavy investment. Material alone in a large boat would cost at least $750,
                            and the labor, though cheap, ran the cost up. The cargo, sometimes as much as 2,500 barrels
                            of potatoes which cost when loaded, from $3,000 to $5,000. The boats
                            were usually sold to be wrecked after the cargoes were disposed of, but occasionally one was
                            brought back by tow boat. It seems strange that boat after boat was loaded with potatoes,
                            here, while now not enough potatoes are raised for local needs. 1 remember well the long
                            lines of potato wagons coming into Rising Sun to be weighed and loaded on flat-boats at the
                            landing, in the fall, ready to start as early as possible. In those years the Espeys
                            probably sent more flatboats than any other family in Rising Sun. Those were both through
                            boats, loaded <list type="footnotes">

                            flatboats were sent each year by various Rising Sun men operating them, and besides these
                            cargoes a vast amount of produce went south on steam boats which was sent by some of the
                            same men. Those active in the flatboat business then were Captain Jim Daly, H. S. Espey, H.
                            Espey, Walker and Bedgood, Ullery, Ben C. Calkins, George McAroy, Oscar Jones, Samuel R.

                            probably familiar. Often over 100 flatboat men would return on the same steamboat, their
                            flatboat trip completed about the same time. In this way the two somewhat rival groups,
                            steam boat men and flatboat men, came to know each other and got along fine. Sometimes a
                            flatboat going south would meet a packet with a large white "0" between
                            its smoke stacks, indicating she was of the <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                            </placeName> River line. The crew would send out a skiff and the men would call,
                            "T-h-r-o-w u-s a p-a-p-e-r." Usually the steam boats carried bundles of
                            late papers which they distributed along the way at landings and these were read over and
                            over by a crew floating along toward market. On one trip Henry and Ruben Clore, who were
                            manufacturing plows and other farm equipment, adapted to use in raising cotton and other
                            southern crops, loaded two boats which they chained together. Just above <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
                            </placeName> they struck an obstruction and both boats were lost—not having any
                            insurance. This loss of several thousand dollars practically ruined these fine men,
                            financially. Another boat owned by the Espeys and operated by Frank Espey, then a young man,
                            went aground near New Madrid, <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                            </placeName>. They threw barrel after barrel overboard to lighten it but an unusually early
                            freeze caught them and they were held up for six weeks. Coasting boats would take up
                            business wherever they could, and besides selling at southern plantations they landed at
                            small towns and sometimes did a very good business. But the local merchants did not like the
                            outside competition so licenses with pretty high fees were required of flatboats. Then some
                            of the boats that had been accustomed to stopping there would tie up on the opposite side of
                            the river and customers came across in skiffs, but sometimes the crew loaded their skiff and
                            took it across near the town and sold the contents, sometimes as much as $100
                            worth in a single skiff load. On a trip in 1876 the Bedgoods found <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
                            </placeName> with a rare blanket of 22 inches of snow and with such heavy ice that the
                            steamer "H. P. Schenck," with Dick Burns, of Rising Sun, as clerk, had to
                            have a tug boat move her. At first all flatboats were loaded along the <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                            </placeName> River and went out into the <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                            </placeName> to the South. This did not change until the <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                            </placeName> Central railway began to bring produce to Cairo which was loaded on the boats
                            from large warehouses along the high levee; then many boats would count on <pb n="336" id="VAA4025-042-4-040"/> completing their loads at Cairo, and it is said that as many as
                            20 or 30 flatboats would be loading or waiting their turns at the same time, while in
                            addition sometimes a half dozen packets for lower <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>, <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                     </placeName>,
                            or up the <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                            </placeName> River were there, too. Since flatboats floated always down stream they could
                            not carry material and supplies to the pioneers in the great West, but steam boats did that
                            work. The flatboat era was at its height just before the Civil War and revived for a period
                            after the war but finally ended in the 1890's.</p>
                        <p>When I was sixteen years old, my parents decided to make a flat-boat trip, and in April I
                            joined them at Natchez, <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                            </placeName>. My trip to Natchez was made on the steam boat "<placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Houston</settlement>
                            </placeName>" which was a large, beautiful boat with Captain Lew Kates in charge.
                            Through years I have traveled much but I can recall no trip as pleasant as that one. The
                            scenery was beautiful all the way down especially the native verdure on the <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                            </placeName>. The passengers were treated as guests, officers took us on tours through
                            cities and towns where we landed enroute. At Natchetz I met my parents and transferred to
                            the flatboat. The load was practically sold out so we coasted slowly along from Natchez to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                            </placeName>. This gave me an opportunity to see the mansions of ante-bellum days, and how
                            stately those white pillared homes looked; a perfect setting for all the romantic southern
                            stories of school girl days. I recall glorious moonlight nights, the flatboat moving
                            silently down stream, the singing of negroes in cabins or in churches, wafted from shore.
                            Occasionally a big steamer passed, fruit luggers glided by. We were anxious to finish the
                            trip and reach <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                            </placeName> and the broad, beautifully moonlit river gave good opportunity to continue
                            often until past midnight, before tying up for the night. The levees were lower then giving
                            us a good view of the shores. The former <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Baton Rouge</settlement>
                            </placeName> state house must have been an architect's night mare, but with its
                            turrets and towers, my young mind pictured it just like English castles and very beautiful.
                            The entire trip from Natchez to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                            </placeName> seemed indescribably lovely. That section was called the sugar coast. Finally
                            our weather worn flatboat tied up in the busiest harbor I have ever seen, <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                            </placeName>. It was overwhelming to a little girl from Rising Sun to see many ocean going
                            vessels, steam boats galore, gulf boats of all kinds and a vast amount of freight being
                            loaded and unloaded on the open levees—hundreds of negroes running back and
                            forth, the mates yelling and swearing at the negroes constantly.</p>
                        <p>I have wished that I might have helped you more, but my first hand knowledge of flatboating
                            was just the afterglow of a factor that had been vital in our family and our town for a long
                            time. How eagerly I listened each year for the throaty whistle of steam boats which meant
                            the return of family members who had taken a flatboat "down the river."
                            And we were sure that in addition to a returning brother there would be a bunch of
                            bananas—a luxury in that day. Too, I enjoyed the annual September exploration of
                            flatboats, the loading, and the smell of new lumber. So you see I had a bit of flatboating.
                            And long afterward, at a <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

                            flatboat painted by an early American artist. I wonder if any others who viewed that
                            painting had ever heard of a flatboat<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>Relations between Northern flatboat men and Southern, white people became strained just before the
                    Civil War, but after the war hostility declined somewhat, though it still persisted. An incident
                    involved Steven Dibble, of Patrior, when he was having a tugboat take his flatboat in at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Steve was wearing his old army overcoat with several buttons missing. There was a
                    strong wind and Dibble probably did not trust the ex-Confederate tugboat skipper so he dashed from
                    side to side and from one end to the other with his coat flapping in the wind. A spectator said,
                    "lookit the damned Yank, flyin’ round like he had hot grease in his
                    pants."</p>
            <p>References have been made to my grandfather, Captain Thomas Pate, so I feel that I should not omit
                    telling something about him, but am sorry to say that I do not have much relating to his experiences
                    as a flatboat man. He got his earliest experience on one of the flatboats built and loaded at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hartford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, on Laughery. He made his first trip when he was 18 or 19 years of age and from
                    knowledge of the rivers gained that way, he was able to qualify as a steamboat pilot. During the
                    Civil War, he was a pilot in the navy and served on gunboats operating on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> River and was on such assignment during the seige of Vicksburg. It happened that he was
                    the only pilot on board when the final engagement started so he had to stand at the wheel for 36
                    hours without relief. Half of the pilot wheel was torn off by a point blank cannon ball which he
                    escaped by dropping to the floor as he saw the gunner touch his match to the vent. Captain Pate
                    became part owner and captain of a steamboat after the Civil War. One narrow escape he had was
                    before the war when he was pilot on the steamer "Red Stone" which blew up while he
                    was at the wheel. Though severely injured, he managed to get hold of some wreckage and kept afloat
                    until rescued. But such incidents belong in the story of steamboats. Captain Tom, as his friends
                    called him, once had an unusual experience when he took a flatboat south before the war. It was
                    customary, if the Southern planter made the necessary arrangements, for his people to get such
                    supplies as he authorized, and he would settle for them <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="338" id="VAA4025-042-4-042"/> when the boat was ready to leave. At one such plantation
                    Captain Tom found that this planter had sometimes failed to pay up. He also learned that he kept a
                    pack of savage-blood hounds at the mansion house. After sending word that he was ready to leave and
                    getting no response, he made the long trip to the mansion house. It was surrounded by a high board
                    fence with a small gate as an entrance. He went through the gate, but was no sooner inside when the
                    savage dogs rushed out from under the "gallery." He could have escaped by jumping
                    back through the gate, but he quickly decided differently. He ran to a corner so no dog could reach
                    him except from the front. The first one rushed at him, but Captain Tom was wearing very heavy boots
                    and placed a kick which gave the hound a major stomach-ache, another one came flying at him and went
                    down with stomach trouble also. The rest of the pack hesitated, and the owner emerged from the house
                    and whistled for his hounds—two of them did not come. The planter began accusing
                    grandfather of killing his best hounds, but he was told he owed a certain sum and that it was due
                    immediately. He paid and grandfather left with his revolver in sight and was soon on his boat and on
                    his way. A similar incident did not come out so well. In that case the flatboat captain went to
                    collect but did not return. His crew went 011 a search and found the captain's
                    body—he had been murdered and robbed. After one of his earliest trips, Tom Pate came back
                    to his home near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hartford</settlement>
                    </placeName> unannounced. He arrived soon after dark and a light snow was falling, through a window
                    of the shoeshop he saw several friends so he took off his shoes and then gave a shrill whistle and
                    ran out of sight on his toes. When they rushed out and saw his tracks, they decided it was a
                    "painter" which was their name for a wildcat, but just as they were organizing to
                    hunt for it, Tom Pate walked out and repeated his whistle. Thus Captain Tom lived near the river and
                    on the river until he and his wife left the old brick house near Laugliery Island which had been his
                    home so long and which he could see from the deck of his steamers as he passed. He retired to Rising
                    Sun and afterward he and his son, T. Smith Pate, loaded a coasting boat. One evening my father took
                    us to see this boat which was tied up at Rabbit Hash, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. We crossed from Rising Sun and after we had visited awhile in the cabin of my uncle
                    Smith said he had to see if the boat was leaking and asked if I would like to go along. The hull was
                    pitch dark and the lantern made weird shadows <pb n="339" id="VAA4025-042-4-043"/> which looked
                    awfully scary to a four-year old boy, but Uncle Smith kept talking as if to himself until suddenly
                    he acted quite surprised to find some candy which it seemed he did not know was there. He got a nice
                    bag of striped stick candy which he gave to me and when we got back to the cabin, he produced
                    another bag for the other guests so I didn't have to share my candy after all. And thus I
                    can say I did have some flatboat experience on the last boat that Captain Tom Pate, my grandfather,
                    was interested in. Grandfather had several brothers who made one or more trips from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hartford</settlement>
                    </placeName> down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, and Taylor Pate sent a good many boats from Patriot some of them having been built at
                    Rising Sun. Other Pates were James, Ben, Fletcher, and Peter, though the last named did not do much
                    flatboating.</p>
            <p>The story of flatboating is a good deal like the boats themselves, each one was usually a private
                    enterprise and though incidents and experiences were similar yet they did not lend themselves to
                    continuity. In the very early days, there were always snags and sand bars, and for many the falls at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> made flatboating rather hazardous. And sometimes gangs would come to a lone boat tied
                    up for the night and would rob crew and boat, but such attacks were infrequent. Shortly after the
                    close of the War of 1812, a gang of murderers and robbers established themselves at Cave in Rock, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. The leader had been an officer in the army. He went under several names, but his real
                    name was Wilson. There is a large cave in the cliff by the river and from this the place gets its
                    name. The gang used this cave which was convenient for them as it had two entrances, one at the foot
                    of a one hundred foot cliff facing the river but hidden by bushes, the other at a level spot on top
                    of the cliff. They had. a hotel back of the cliff which they used to lure travelers. Those who
                    possessed money or other valuables were murdered and robbed. They also waylaid travelers in the
                    wilderness so that it was not safe to travel in that part of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> or adjacent <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. As the number of flatboats increased, they turned their attention to them and lured
                    them ashore in different ways. Sometimes a, man would row out by himself and ask for help for his
                    sick family. Other schemes were used, but the results were the same and all the victims were
                    murdered. It is said they even captured one of the early steamboats, but this has never been
                    confirmed. One boat, however, was lost in that vicinity with no survivors. Finally, the government
                    offered a reward of five thousand dollars for <pb n="340" id="VAA4025-042-4-044"/> Wilson dead or
                    alive. Five daring men started to win that prize, but they were captured instead. They made Wilson
                    believe they really wanted to join the gang so they were not put to death. As soon as they could,
                    they escaped and realizing the gang was too strong for them to hope for success themselves, they
                    organized a large posse and captured Wilson. Since they were of the opinion that he would try to
                    escape and that his gang would probably try to rescue him, the posse had a brief trial and then
                    executed him. They packed his head in clay and shipped it to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> where the outlaw was identified, and the reward sent. That ended the Cave in Rock
                    robber gang. Of course, there were always cases of men disappearing and foul play was suspected, but
                    nothing on such an organized scale.</p>
            <p>In the history of flatboating the heaviest single loss from Rising Sun was that of the two Clore
                    boats which were loaded with machinery and repair parts. Later, another flatboat owned, loaded, and
                    manned by Ulmanseik and Stegemiller and named "The Sauer Kraut" struck an unseen
                    object, and flatboat as well as the cargo were a total loss.</p>
            <p>Some incidents recorded by historians might have been Rising Sun boats and were, no doubt, known to
                    many Rising Sun inhabitants. One was at Tobinsport, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, when heavy fog almost caused a collision between a flatboat and a small ferryboat. The
                    pilot said, "I thought sure we would hit that ferry but a tall young fellow who was running
                    it, jumped to the gouger and fairly lifted his boat out of our way. I heard another fellow call him
                    Abe and told him to look out, but Abe had seen us as soon as the other fellow," Then at a
                    later period some of the men related their experiences to the folks back home. They told of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> slave market and how horrified they had been at some of the things they had seen there.
                    One man said, "I saw a big tall fellow who just stood silent while a half white girl was
                    put up for sale, I saw his knuckles become white as he clenched his fists. Then as he turned away he
                    looked almost sick and he said, "if ever I get a chance I will hit that business and hit it
                    hard"; one of the men with him said he was Abe Lincoln from up Sangamon River in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>." And thus flatboat men gathered ideas and passed them on to friends back
                    home.</p>
            <p>One source of information for this article has been, "Happenings of the Past," in
                    the Rising Sun <hi rend="i">Recorder</hi>. There have been several items about flatboats. One which
                    I followed <pb n="341" id="VAA4025-042-4-045"/> was about a boat from North's Landing and
                    the crew was listed as Captain J. H. Barker, mate, George North, clerk, Grant North, and chamber
                    maid, Neall Powell. She was reported as loaded with 4,022 barrels of potatoes.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                    My home was in sight of North's Landing and I knew all of the crew except Captain Barker so
                    I wrote to Grant North who answered promptly. North said the boat was really a barge with a roof and
                    was not difficult to operate, but was in a tow with nearly a dozen other produce boats of the same
                    kind. Grant continued, "So we had no use for mate, clerk, or chamber maid or
                    cook—about all we did was to eat and sleep going down." It appears, therefore,
                    that the crew just went along for the ride, which was not a bad idea. An item of 1884 said,
                    "H. S. Espey and Son have contracted with W. H. Whitlock for a new flatboat 92 1/2 feet
                    long and 22 1/2 feet wide for the fall trade."<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Another item dated 1874
                    said that Captain Espey had started south to look after his interests in that direction and that T.
                    Smith Pate was taking Captain Espey's place behind the counter during his absence.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> I can imagine with what keen interest Captain Espey would watch for his own
                    boats floating along, and perhaps, as he passed them, he gave them a brief message from Rising Sun.
                    Then in New Orlems, he would meet commission men and then probably select goods to be sent up to
                    Rising Sun. I recall how quickly the news spread that an Espey flatboat loaded with goods for his
                    stores had been towed up from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. People flocked to the Espey stores to see even if they did not want to buy. There were
                    groceries of all kinds and also drygoods and other things, many of which were imported or had come
                    down the Atlantic coast and through the Gulf of Mexico. Espey not only stocked his own stores, but
                    permitted other merchants to have some of the goods. It is told that flatboats, in passing, would
                    often hail each other and call out, "Where from and what's your
                    load?" When the answer was "Indiana" they would often laugh
                    and say, "hoop poles and punkins, of course." Crews from boats to the lower <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>

                    school building and found the door unlocked. They entered and discovered a fire in the stove and a
                    tramp. He would not talk to them, but began scratching himself vigorously which was probably to
                    indicate that there were insects around. The Hoosiers went him one better. They joked about lice and
                    other insects they had met, and then one of them began laughing and when questioned, he said, he had
                    failed to tell them that he had been told that the bed they had slept in the night before had been
                    occupied by a man who had died of smallpox. The tramp left in a hurry. Such incidents, true or not,
                    were the tales told by returning crewmen.</p>

                        twenty feet in width. They required from thirty to sixty days to make the trip from this section

            <p>The story of early Congregationalism in Indiana has never been fully told. Brief accounts of a
                    general nature, and anniversary sketches of individual churches have, of course, been written, but
                    no adequate treatment of the subject, based on the available manuscript material, has ever appeared.
                    In part this is because Congregationalists were not writing the history of their denomination as
                    leaders of other denominations in Indiana were doing; in part because the source material has not
                    been examined. Still another consideration is that Congregational churches in Indiana were so few in
                    number. This paper is not a complete account of the growth of Congregationalism. It is a sketch,
                    rather than a compendium, of this growth to the year 1858. Its aim is to suggest lines for further
                    treatment, not exhaustively to deal with the subject.</p>

            <p>Aside from the rather general fact that New Englanders were scarce in Indiana, there were no
                    important Congregational colonies in the state; nor had extensive sales of public lands been made to
                    such companies as were purchasing them for New Englanders settling in <placeName>

                    were any Congregational churches constituted at the East for emigration to a preselected site in

            <p>There is a more cogent reason why the forces of Congregationalism in Indiana were impoverished in the
                    early period. This is to be found in the record of the agencies which planted the numerous mission

                    agencies organized only Presbyterian churches. Despite the fact that a large percentage of the
                    ministers employed by the two last-named societies were Congregationalists, no Congregational
                    churches were formed in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> When the American Home Missionary Society

                    </placeName> last year, In attendance from Indiana. were Howard H. Peckham, secretary of the Indiana

                    </placeName>, a director of the Northern Indiana Historical Society.</p>
            <p>The Association voted to inaugurate a quarterly magazine for history teachers, in co-operation with
                    Cornell University Press. This periodical is designed for national circulation among junior and
                    senior high school history teachers, to help them to do a more effective job of interesting their
                    students. Individual member dues in the Association were raised to $3, and institutional
                    memberships were pegged at $5. The Association is making a determined effort to raise
                    additional funds by selling higher classes of membership to individuals, local societies, and
                    corporations having historical interests. The goal of the Association is to employ a traveling
                    executive secretary who can help societies in each state become more active and effective.</p>
            <p>The Association has also instituted a system of awards to local historical societies for
                    distinguished activity each year. The society that has done most by way of providing good programs,
                    issuing publications, gaining members, leading the community in historical observances, etc., is
                    given a certificate of commendation. Another contest is open to newspapers, service clubs,
                    patriotic, and fraternal organizations for their historical activities. The country is divided into
                    five regions, and there are winners in each region. It should stimulate local historical societies
                    to know that their activities are watched by a national organization which stands ready to give them
                    recognition for their efforts. Indeed, the idea has suggested to the Indiana Historical Bureau the
                    desirability of instituting a statewide contest on a similar basis.</p>
            <p>The Association passed a resolution to submit to President Truman a request for declaration of a
                    National History Week, which would focus attention on the work of state and local historians once
                    each year.</p>

                    local museums. Having inspected many of them, he is aware of their faults. He urged the adoption of
                    three policies. First, local museums should delimit their scope; that is, they should determine how
                    broad a field they will attempt to cover. Naturally, the history of their own community suggests
                    itself first. Then they should refuse materials pertaining to other parts of the world and even
                    non-historical gimcracks of their own area. Secondly, he advised "good
                    housekeeping"—the keeping of accurate accession records and catalogues and the
                    use of enough storage space so that everything is not on display at one time. Finally, he
                    recommended developing the community services of the museum, to schools, clubs, business firms, and
                    others.</p>
            <p>Other papers dealt with publicity practices of historical societies, acquiring and preserving
                    historical properties, and with folklore. The 1947 meeting of the Association will occur at <placeName>

                    the following analysis of the population of the county and the names and census statistics of the
                    people of the township of general interest. The tables on <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey County</region>
                    </placeName> are included for their own value and to give background to the unusual conditions in <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The statistics for the county indicate that the largest number of the people exclusive of Hoosiers
                    were natives of the Southern states and that there were more natives of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> than of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> or of the Middle Atlantic States (see Table I).</p>
            <p>Because of the large percentage of adults from the Southern and Middle Atlantic states, and the age
                    (see Table III) and nativity of their children, one is led to believe that a considerable migration
                    from these sections to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey County</region>
                    </placeName> took place in the early part of the nineteenth century. It is probably true that the
                    Germans who settled permanently in this region came in large numbers somewhat later. It might also
                    be suggested that previous to the birth of so many native Hoosiers, the Southerners formed the
                    largest element in the population. Perhaps they were in a majority. To what extent was the
                    population above the age of twenty in 1850 typical of the population in 1830 as respects
                    nativity? Although less than one per cent of the total population came from the New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> states, one may assume that some of the New Englanders migrated to this county early in
                    the century.</p>
            <p>The distribution of wealth (see Table 11) according to the valuation of real estate tends to confirm
                    the above conclusions. Although it does not seem likely that the natives of Southern states brought
                    much wealth with them, they held in 1850 approximately forty-three per cent of the total. Since they
                    formed less than nineteen per cent of the population, this would indicate a longer period of
                    residence. It is also interesting to note that the foreign element ranked <pb n="356" id="VAA4025-042-4-060"/> second with almost twenty-two per cent. Since they came later. to the
                    county, does this indicate that they brought relatively more with them or that they were more

            <p>The so-called society of Harmony had its origin in Württemberg, from a schism in the
                    Lutheran church about the year 1785. One hundred and fifty families in 1804 under the guidance of
                    George Rapp, their pastor, emigrated to America and settled in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. After nine years in America, the society had acquired considerable wealth and wished
                    to find a more favorable location. Frederick Rapp, one of their members and an adopted son of George
                    Rapp, was sent on a tour of observation with instructions that a healthy site, good land, water
                    power, and convenient river communication were to be considered when making the choice. After
                    traveling for some months, he finally decided on the present site of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>

            <p>Richard Flower, who had been commissioned by George Rapp to sell the large Harmonist estate, came to
                    Braxfield to visit Robert Owen at a time when he was disappointed in a number of his plans. Flower
                    suggested Harmonie as a possible site for Owen to put into practical operation his plans for
                    communistic colonization which he had publicly advocated for sometime. Robert Dale Owen states,

                    supporting tens of thousands in a country where the expression of thought was free, and where the

            <p>This letter from "Father" George Rapp to John L. Baker (also Bacher) was dated July
                    2, 1814, and was sent by post on July 2, 1814. George Rapp, therefore, was still in Harmony, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, while John L. Baker was in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, having gone there probably with the first contingent, which must have left during the
                    spring of 1814. The letter reveals the steps that were being taken to dispose of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> holdings and also that the income would be sufficient to buy additional good land in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Between the lines one can read that George Rapp had some fears that a spirit of
                    discontent was developing and admonished against it. The industrious nature of the community was
                    evident by the fact that they were able to harvest three hundred loads of hay with much more in
                    prospect. The German is in places very quaint with much dialect influence. The sentences are strung
                    together with commas rather than periods. Capitalization is erratic and the umlaut is at times
                    unintentionally omitted.</p>

                        <p>I am informing you that since your departure nothing of importance has happened here.
                                    Some have become ill again, for instance Christina Dürwachter; most
                                    persons despaired of her life, but <hi rend="i">now</hi> she is improving. Regina
                                    Schäffer has been very ill, but she is well again. Reisch was seriously
                                    ill, but today I visited him; he really won't die. Otherwise all are well
                                    and active. Already many prospective buyers have come to look over our land. If it
                                    cannot be disposed of</p>

                                    Häuser und Cothen werden besehen, die einen guten Preis bringen werden.
                                    Desswegen möget ihr das gute land um unsere tracte herum
                                    knüpfen, sonderlich die Insel nieht vergessen, wegen der
                                    Komonität und Friedens halber, wir Rechnen alle Tage wie weit ihr seyn
                                    möchtet, und wissen her-nach doch nichts, aber doch geht das Wort Pauli

                                    because hope accompanies love. It is no small matter to have to miss one another,
                                    even though only a short period has elapsed. But in this matter love must show its
                                    strength in order that our courage may be sustained to carry out our duties
                                    obediently, since the Brotherhood has so decreed. On this foundation you can stand
                                    firmly, it will not give way: if you live, you will live in the Lord; if one or the
                                    other should die, he will die in the Lord—and death will not part us.</p>

                                    any longer feels that this is his home. We are bored by the many business
                                    transactions which are awaiting settlement. Meanwhile we have made more than 300

                                    on July 10. Business deals are piling up and yet fail to make the time pass. It
                                    won't get any better until we are all together again. You will have
                                    realized this at the time of your departure and still day by day you will realize
                                    that we belong together. From this fact you can visibly see and</p>

            <p>This letter was written by Romelius L. Baker (who, after George Rapp's death in 1847, took
                    over the control of the Rappists at Economy, <placeName>

                    letter was not sent by mail, but went with the second transport. Romelius was apparently one of the
                    leading business managers of the community. The supplementary note, written September 17, shows in
                    what flux conditions were; on the fourteenth Romelius doubted whether his father (or was it Father
                    Rapp?) could leave by fall; three days later the departure was set for fall. The letter
                    is the most carefully written and shows the best composition of the four. Its content is largely
                    personal. The address side reads:</p>

                        <p>Das fast unaufhorliche Andenken an euch, veranlasst mich durch diese gute Gelegenheit

                                    euch unauf'hörlich zu missen, und nicht wie
                                    gewöhnlich bey uns wa-ret, oft haben wir geglaubt einer oder der andere
                                    sey irgend wohin gegangen, und werde bald wieder komen, allein als man sich recht
                                    besonnen hat, so waret ihr äusser-lich sehr weit von uns getrennt, Ob
                                    jezt schon eine zeit her eure Abwesenheit uns nist mehr so hart ist als zuerst, so
                                    befindet sich dennoch ein groses Verlangen im Inwendigen nach euch, unsere El-tern
                                    und ich auch haben schon oft gewunscht, wir möchten nur konen an Wabasch
                                    hinunter fliegen, und euch sehen, und mit euch reden, denn ungetrennt
                                    äusert sich die Liebe niemals so viel, und das Briiderliche Verlangen,
                                    nach einan-der ist keines Wegs so fühlbar als bey einer so langen
                                    Trennung, welches ihr ohne zweifel selbst werdet erfahren haben, aber dieweil es
                                    sich jezt so zugetragen, dass wir versezt worden, und nicht hat konen wohl anders

                        <p>Harmony, September 14, 1814. John &amp; Jacob L. Baker Much beloved Brothers:</p>
                        <p>The almost constant thought of you impels me to seize this good opportunity [the
                                    departure of a transport] to write to you, for at first after your departure we felt
                                    great grief having to miss you constantly, not having you as usually with us. Often
                                    we imagined that one or the other had gone somewhere and would soon return; but as
                                    we reflected we realized that you were physically widely separated from us. Although
                                    as time passed your absence was no longer so hard to bear as at first, yet there
                                    exists within us a great longing for you; our parents and I have often wished that
                                    we might be able to fly down to the <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                                    </placeName> to see you, to talk to you, for love without absence never manifests
                                    itself so much, and the brotherly longing for one another is by no means so
                                    noticeable as after so long a separation. Without doubt you have experienced this
                                    yourself. Now that we are parted —it could not be avoided—we
                                    recall Father's sermon which he delivered on the last Sunday that you were
                                    here. He spoke of the stone of the Patriarch Jacob which often appears along our way
                                    for us to rest our heads, which usually seems hard. Yet we shall cleave to one
                                    another, and we are comforted when we feel that we have more comrades who fare as we
                                    do and who are associated with us on our way. As for our physical condition we are
                                    at present well and hale, namely our parents and our brothers and sisters
                                    ["Geschwister" may mean either brothers or sisters or both]; nor

                                    wie eine liebliche Har-monie. Indessen weis ich weiter nichts zu schreiben, die

                        <p>our relationship especially dangerously ill. We heartily hope that you too may all be
                                    well, for we can indeed realize that you will require health and a good spirit in
                                    such a great undertaking.—Catherine was sorely afflicted during June and
                                    July with her grievous ailment, but has been rather well for a considerable time. As
                                    far as I was concerned, her ailment never worried me so much when the two of you
                                    were still here as it has since, for then you were sharers of our sorrow. Now, since
                                    the family is smaller, it makes a great difference, something which I would not have
                                    believed before.</p>
                        <p>It will hardly be the lot of our family to be on our way this year, for father has
                                    considerable business to attend to here; but we can't be sure of it, since
                                    six or eight weeks may elapse before the third transport will depart. Even if it
                                    [our departure] should not occur this year, nevertheless our love and longing will
                                    not disappear even during the cold winter, neither among you nor us. No, indeed,
                                    rather will we look forward with joy to the pleasant reunion, when we again shall
                                    all live together and again be linked together like a sweet harmony. I know <hi rend="i">of</hi> nothing more to write. The brethren will give you a careful
                                    account of all things that have taken place since your departure.</p>
                        <p>I remain with the hope that when we meet again I shall find you in good health.</p>

            <p>The third letter was written by Frederic Rapp to "Father" George Rapp, who was now
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, having gone with the second transport. Part of it was written on October 30, another
                    part on October 31, and an addition on November 1. It deals nearly entirely with business matters.
                    This letter was the most difficult to translate, and a few of the translations may not be accurate.
                    Hay wine may be wine that has been cured in a stack of hay. "Zackenrad-Zapfen" and
                    "Kelsch" need further study. "Kelsch" in the Swabian dialect
                    means goblet (Kelch), but the word "Stuck" preceding it is troublesome. What the
                    figures in the final column under Bill of Goods signify is not clear, whether the amount is in cents
                    and represents the price per yard or the total cost of the bolts in dollars.
                    "Piece" in connection with the goods means the "whole piece" or
                    bolt. The word "Ausla-dung" on the final page, contrary to its usual meaning, here
                    seems to be used in the sense of filling up the unused space in the boats. The lists of goods
                    contain a strange combination of German and English. On the first page, after the word
                    "Potetoes," the writer, probably afraid that this word might <pb n="401" id="VAA4025-042-4-105"/> not be understood, inserted the German dialect form
                    "Grundbeere," a translation of the French <hi rend="i">pommes de terre</hi>.
                    "Drap plains" mentioned in the second list is <hi rend="i">drab</hi>, a thick
                    woolen cloth. "Casinet" (cassinette) is a cloth with a cotton warp and a woof of
                    very fine wool. What the term "wings" in the last line refers to is not clear to
                    the translator. It is interesting to note that orders for cloth came to Harmony from as far away as
                    Corydon.</p>

                                    geben, ich habe vor etlich Wochen einen Brief von Corydon von einem Kaufman Nahmens
                                    Davis Hogel erhalten wo er mich ersucht um ein klein Asort-ment Tücher,
                                    welche ihm bey un-sern Leuthen schiken soll, da ich aber nicht weiss in welcher

                        <p>In addition I have given J. L. Baker a package containing $1200 in notes,
                                    which he will deliver to you. I have also given him an extra $200 for
                                    traveling expenses. Several weeks ago I received a letter from Corydon, sent by a
                                    merchant named Davis Hogel, in which he requests a small assortment of cloths, which
                                    I am to have one of our people deliver. Since, however, I do not know in which
                                    region it lies and also have no one who could take care of this errand, I must pass
                                    it up. Today we had a small sorrow in the house; Fordu died a natural death. With
                                    the next group of persons will be sent 1000 fruit trees and also all the poplars
                                    which we have here. I trust that the streets are laid out sufficiently wide for a
                                    row of poplars on each side; this is said to be an excellent specific against fever.
                                    Inform me how much money the captain is to receive, so that upon his return I may be
                                    able to settle with him. Furthermore, let me know if all the notes of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

            <p>The fourth letter, sent on December 17, by post (postage 25c) contains three parts, one by Christoph
                    Miller, a physician, another by Rosina (daughter of George Rapp), and the third by Romelius L.
                    Baker. The medical information in the first part is interesting. Senega root extract is official in
                    the <placeName>

                    sheep excreta. William was a fellow physician, who had gone ahead to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Interesting also is the description of the desire to secure gold and silver, rather
                    than notes. The "state warrants" represent the scrip issued by the states,
                    especially to pay soldiers of the war of 1812–1814; these warrants were accepted by the
                    federal government at face value in the purchase of government land. The lines written by Romelius
                    L. Baker contain interesting information on the financial transactions of the community. Those
                    persons left behind in Harmony were suffering privations, and discord seems to have been rising.</p>

                        <p>walder vor, wo von ich dir letzte Woche eine Abschrift schickte-Er war einer ganz
                                    andern Meynung als wir, und glaubte für bestimmt dass das solches keine
                                    Ausreden von Heckenwälder und Kriemer wäaren, sondern dass
                                    wirklich kein Silber oder Gold zu bekommen, und dass er dachte man sollte so viel
                                    States Warrants nehmen als wir allerfalls nöthig hatten Land zu bezahlen,
                                    weil diese in der regier-ung immer denselben werth behiel-ten, und auch Noten von
                                    verschie-denen Banks sollten wir ‘nehmen, und eben so viel Gold u. Silber
                                    als es sich thun liesse. Man konte die Noten auswechseln u.s.w. Wir sagten er sollte
                                    schreiben, und hauptsachlich darauf dringen dass Mr. Kriemer selbst kame, und die
                                    Vortheile des Landes in Augen-schein nehmen, sie könnten als
                                    un-interressirten Manner mehr von der Sache sagen als wir, besonders da sie nun
                                    authorisirt sind einen Ver-kauf im Ganzen zu schliessen—und in die
                                    Pittsburger Gazette ha-ben wir aus Anrathen Mr. Crom-wells wirklich schon
                                    einrücken las-sen dass der Verkauf in Stucken bis Februar aufgeschoben
                                    sei, und dass Mr. Baldwin und Cromwell in der Zeit authorisirt seinen einen Verkauf
                                    im Ganzen zu schliessen. —Sonst hat sich auf dieser Seite bisher nichts
                                    gezeigt.—Bei uns geht es bisher so ziemlich gut, ausser dem Heimweh und

                        <p>the vinedressers Sailer and Eckenst [ein?], to your house and read the
                                    letter of Heckenwälder to him, a copy of which I sent to you last week.
                                    He disagreed entirely with us and believed with certainty that the report of
                                    Heckenwälder and Kriemer presented no lame excuses, but that in fact no
                                    silver or gold was obtainable. He thought that we should take with us as many state
                                    warrants as we might eventually need to pay for the land, because these, so far as
                                    the government is concerned, always retain a constant value; in addition we ought to
                                    take the notes of various banks and as much gold and silver as can be obtained. The
                                    notes could then be cashed, etc. We said that he should write [to Mr. Kriemer] and
                                    urge him to come himself to inspect the ad vantages of our land. As disinterested
                                    men they [Kriemer and his partners] could present the case [the sale of the lacd]
                                    better than we, especially since they are now authorized to effect the sale as a
                                    unit. On the advice of Mr. Cromwell we have actually inserted a notice in the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                                    </placeName> Gazette that the sale in small lots has been deferred until February,
                                    and that in the meantime Messrs. Baldwin and Cromwell are authorized to conclude the
                                    sale as a unit. Otherwise there have been no developments along this
                                    line.—</p>
                        <p>Things so far are going pretty well with us except for the homesickness and the
                                    longing for the fathers. Why is it that we have received no letter from you for so
                                    long a time? We crave news from you, but we wait from one post to another
                                    in vain.</p>

                        <p>flow of saliva, which I stimulate with senega root extract. Also the daughter of the
                                    Schaal's is afflicted with it. The others are improving. Hydrochloric acid
                                    is an excellent remedy in the treatment of it if used soon enough and after the
                                    patients have been purged and given laxatives. I have already recommended this
                                    treatment to William; should he be out of it [hydrochloric acid], he will be able to
                                    secure it from shepherds. Soon after Frederick left us I had intended operating on
                                    the daughter of the Wolfart's but as the outcome seemed doubtful and
                                    because of the deep incision which I should have been obliged to make between the
                                    ribs and extending to the chest wall, I was deterred; in addition there was a
                                    scrofulous hardening at the place where I wanted to make the
                                    incision.—Why don't I get a letter from William?</p>
                        <p>On the 13th and 14th I and many others felt great concern for Frederick and those who
                                    accompanied him. The Wagner woman especially caused me sore tribulation [or
                                    temptation?]. On Christmas I am resolved to speak on the salvation of
                                    sinners, a subject on which I possess a great deal of material. I shall be obliged
                                    to alternate now and then [in preaching] and at such times when I feel that you are
                                    not opposed to me and since it is demanded by many. Father, I am walking in the
                                    paths of lust, but I shall still render sufficient service to the Lord Jesus, to you
                                    and the community, because I have received mercy, therefore I believe, and on this
                                    subject I shall speak when I speak, I greet you, Frederick, my mother, and all
                                    others very heartily. Entirely yours, Christoph.</p>

                        <p>Seit Deiner Abreise hat sich bey uns weiter nichts besonders zugetragen. —
                                    Anf angs dieser Woche war ich in Pittsburg und gerade war des Ewings partner nahmes
                                    Mr. Breding dort und hatte drey Drafts zwey von Vater einer mit 100, der andere mit
                                    2000 Thaler, welche beide indorsed waren von N. Ewings, aber der dritte den Jno L.
                                    Baker fur 3212.14 gegeben war nicht indorsed Die Bank wolte ihn dessentwegen auch
                                    nicht annehmen, bis Mr. Wallice als ein Freund und Bekannter von Ewings &amp;
                                    Bred ing gut gesprochen und ein Schrei-ben gegeben hat, dass er wolte Bondsman seyn
                                    wan es Schwierig-keiten geben solte, worauf dem Bredig $1112.10 bezahlt
                                    wurde und das andere soll auf den Cr. der United states gebracht werden, das aber
                                    erst nach deiner zuruckkunft gethan werden wird—Das Silber soll

                        <p>December 17</p>
                        <p>Dear Frederick:</p>
                        <p>Since your departure nothing especially noteworthy has happened here. At the
                                    beginning of this week I was in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and at the same time a partner of Mr. Ewings by the name of Mr. Breding
                                    was present. He had three drafts, two from father, one of them for $1000,
                                    the other for $2000, both of which were indorsed by N. Ewings. But the
                                    third draft, which Jno. L. Baker had drawn for $3212.14, was not
                                    indorsed. For this reason the bank would not accept it until Mr. Wallice, as a
                                    friend and acquaintance of Ewings &amp; Breding, went surety and by a note
                                    declared to be bondsman should any difficulties arise. Thereupon the bank paid
                                    Breding $1112. 10, and the remainder is to be placed to the credit of the <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, but this will not be done until your return. Silver at present is said
                                    to be worth… per c. in <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, that is the price the buyer has to pay.</p>
                        <p>Today we sold 20 head of young cattle, four oxen, and a bull for $404;
                                    indeed everything is going on as usual. In our manufacturing enterprise there is
                                    nothing out of the ordinary. Cloth is at present in fairly good demand by the piece.
                                    Half of our furs we sent to Hutton &amp; Me Gekle and the other half to Jac.

                        <p>In conclusion, we are sound and well, but we are suffering great</p>

                    </placeName> during the episcopacies of John Stephen Bazin (October 1847-April 1848) and of Maurice
                    de St. Palais (1849–1877). In treating the era prior to the erection of the Diocese of

                    </placeName> in 1857, development throughout the whole of Indiana is considered since the diocese
                    was coextensive with the state; but in studying the period following that event attention is
                    confined to the southern part. Phrases of economic and social movements affecting religious
                    development are noted." The quotation is appropriate to the content of the book.</p>

                    </placeName>, the initial Catholic see in Indiana, was still a missionary diocese,
                    "depending upon financial contributions of European mission societies and friends of the
                    clergy …" for support, when Father Bazin became its bishop. Priests and other
                    religious leader.; were almost exclusively European-born, mainly French, but the laity was
                    principally German. The diocese lacked the formal ecclesiastical government and discipline often
                    found in established sees. It was deeply attached to its European moorings which lingered longer
                    than for Indiana Protestant groups whose origin represented a break with European tradition.</p>
            <p>The three decades from 1847–1877 were a period of substantial growth and expansion within
                    the diocese. These decades brought German clergy to the leadership of the diocese, the expansion and
                    development of educational activities, the growth of the church in urban centers and at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in particular, a marked increase in diocesan membership and personnel and a more formal
                    government structure. By 1877 European influences had been weakened and a spirit of American
                    Catholicism was in evidence. This study, a doctoral dissertation at The Catholic University of
                    America, reflects extensive research in Catholic sources including the University of Notre Dame
                    Archives. A knowledge of diocesan correspondence <pb n="411" id="VAA4025-042-4-115"/> regarding
                    trends and problems is reflected in the discussion of administrative matters, parochial needs,
                    educational programs, Civil War attitudes, and post-war developments.</p>
            <p>When the author connects Catholic developments with the general currents in Indiana, the result is
                    less satisfactory. The influence of railroads in diverting trade to the East is probably
                    overstressed and the bibliography is minus the study of this question by Albert L. Kohlmeier in his
                        <hi rend="i">The Old Northwest</hi> … (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, 1938). Southern Indiana was a Democratic stronghold during the Civil War and
                    had been a generation, however, there was solid and strong Union sentiment among those who followed
                    the Jacksonian tradition. The Know-Nothing movement in Indiana was certainly guilty of prejudice and
                    excesses as indicated, yet this movement would not have gained the strength which it did had it not
                    been in part the result of the attitude and policy of some Catholics regarding public schools, to
                    cite but one issue. The attachment to European moorings so apparent in pioneer Catholicism sheds
                    further light on the background of the Know-Nothing movement. There are a few minor slips such as
                    that citing James Whitcomb as governor during 1844–1843 (pp. 32, 126). Whitcomb was
                    elected in 1843 and re-elected in 1846 but resigned in 1848. Chapter V gives scant attention to
                    efforts to improve education before 1846.</p>
            <p>This volume is a desirable and useful contribution t:, the history of religion in Indiana. It is
                    regretted that other religious groups are generally not doing an equal amount to preserve and write
                    their history. No history of this or any other state can be complete without devoting considerable
                    attention to the development and influence of religious thought and life.</p>

            <p>This study constitutes neither a comprehensive biography of the first Roosevelt nor a history of the
                    Progressive Movement. Rather, it attempts to delineate the assistance rendered the progressive cause
                    by Roosevelt and to judge whether that, <pb n="412" id="VAA4025-042-4-116"/> aid sprang from
                    conviction or from nothing deeper than the opportunism of a masterful political leader who
                    understood the direction of the tide.</p>
            <p>As for the first, Mowry credits T. R. with being progressivism's best publicity man and with
                    "achieving the possible" in a divided congress. As for motives, he believes
                    Roosevelt to have been an opportunist with honest reform leanings. He was at his happiest when the
                    expediency dictated by his desire for power coincided with reform. Though this judgment would have
                    been anathema to his admiring contemporaries, it is less severe than that accorded him by such
                    recent historians as Henry F. Pringle. To the same degree, William Howard Taft's reputation
                    suffers from these pages.</p>
            <p>It is understandable that Roosevelt's record would appear lo better advantage following the
                    recent release of his voluminous correspondence for the period since 1909. This study is one of the
                    first to make use of these manuscripts, and the author's interest in them is indicated by
                    his hasty disposition of Roosevelt's years as president in a single, introductory chapter.
                    In comparison, the following four years make up the next nine chapters and two-thirds of the volume.
                    The one theme dominating them is the Taft-Roosevelt split.</p>
            <p>According to Mowry, T. R. returned from his African hunt with no premeditated intention of breaking
                    with Taft but with fear in his heart that the growing division between the conservative and
                    progressive Republicans might give victory to the Democrats. And "to the normal Roosevelt
                    way of thinking even a reactionary Republican of the deepest hue was an infinitely better citizen
                    than the best of Democrats/’ His immediate goal, therefore, was to restore harmony by
                    spreading assurances to both groups. Taft's apparent inability to mend the schism worried
                    him more than did the President's conservatism.</p>
            <p>The next year saw the two leaders drift apart, but a decisive turning point, the author believes, did
                    not occur until October 27, 1911. On that day the Taft Administration announced that it had begun an
                    anti-trust suit against the Untied States Steel Corporation for its purchase of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> Coal and Iron Company. Whereas, T. R., when president, had given the merger his
                    blessing, the suit prodded him into that feeling of righteous indignation which rose so quickly at
                    any suggestion of his having made a major error.</p>
            <pb n="413" id="VAA4025-042-4-117"/>
            <p>Publicly, however, he still moved with caution, and it was only after he became convinced that he
                    could actually win the Republican nomination away from Taft that he entered the lists. By the time
                    that effort failed his commitments and emotions pushed him into the fatal third party move, in
                    which, according to his private correspondence, he expected nothing but defeat.</p>
            <p>In the long run, Mowry asserts, the Bull Moose split was more harmful than otherwise to the liberal
                    cause. For when the chastened Progressives returned to the Republican fold their influence was gone,
                    and the party was to be consistently conservative through the next generation. In his closing years,
                    Roosevelt, himself, turned to military preparedness, nationalism, and conservatism.</p>
            <p>The excellent style of this book could have been further improved by more economical phrasing. The
                    most serious criticism in the eyes of this reviewer, however, is the inordinate amount of space
                    given to the years 1909–1912, with consequent slighting of other periods. The explanation
                    for T. R.'s decision to head a third party in 1912 is not entirely satisfying in the light
                    of his usual antipathy for foredoomed causes. After he failed to get the Republican nomination he
                    could have launched another of his hunting trips or retired to his tent. Perhaps the progressive
                    split was not as much responsible for Republican conservatism in the twenties as were the war,
                    prosperity, and the basic rural and business nature of its composition.</p>
            <p>These judgments are intended as casual remarks on a valuable study rather than as sweeping
                    criticisms.</p>

            <p>For the many students of Lincoln's career, who are not experts or authorities, this little
                    bibliography is essential. Angle has furnished them a guidebook through the intricacies of the
                    writings of and about Lincoln.</p>
            <p>The writings and speeches of the Civil War President <pb n="414" id="VAA4025-042-4-118"/> were not
                    all published by John G. Nicholay and John Hay and the student will want to know where to find the
                    more recently discovered items and the trustworthiness of the various editors and compilers.</p>
            <p>The task of writing an adequate life of Lincoln has been too difficult for the biographers, each of
                    whom had their deficiencies, but many of whom had their virtues. Angle treats them fairly and points
                    out their strong and weak points. Nicholay gives us "excellent summaries of all the major
                    problems of the war and Lincoln's attitude towards them … [p. 411."
                    Barton "is still the best source for the ancestry of Lincoln, both maternal and paternal
                    … [p. 49]." "Beveridge's account of the Indiana period of
                    Lincoln's life is unrivalled …. His is by long odds the best and most exhaustive
                    treatment of Lincoln's eight years in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> legislature, and of his one term in the national House of Representatives. In fact,
                    Beveridge's account of Lincoln's entire political career, including party
                    management as well as office holding, is unsurpassed, and not likely to be excelled [p.
                    55]."</p>
            <p>The special studies and monographs are also treated in similar manner. One work is evaluated thusly:
                    "A compilation that could have been enormously valuable to the general reading public is
                    actually often misleading …. [p. 97]." Where to go to learn about constitutional
                    matters, personal finances, or any of a number of special phases of his life, is answered in the
                    discussion of these works.</p>
            <p>The bibliography at the end of the volume includes the studies which the author has evaluated. It,
                    therefore, includes some eighty-one items and constitutes "A Shelf of Lincoln
                    Books" about which the student of Lincoln should be well informed.</p>

            <p>This report is a composite reaction to the historical philosophy <pb n="415" id="VAA4025-042-4-119"/>
                    of Charles A. Beard. The early pages are quite Beardian, but the committee, apparently, was not in
                    complete agreement, for there is at least a thread of inconsistency throughout the volume. The
                    second chapter is highly critical of the early historians who introduced to this country scientific
                    methods in history and seems to assume that the historical profession has advanced beyond scientific
                    history to the conscious propagation of hypothesis of human conduct. The third chapter, if not the
                    remainder of the book, does not possess this slant and seems to hold fast to scientific ideals.</p>
            <p>Beard, in the first chapter, wrote an excellent statement of the importance of studying and writing
                    history, with which historians are not likely to find fault. He desires a reconsideration of our
                    methods and the context of our work, but leaves the further development of his ideas to others.</p>
            <p>These ideas, as stated by the authors of the second chapter, involve the assertion that historians
                    have not and cannot assume an objective attitude. Since this is true, they should choose their bias,
                    their "principle of selection," and proceed to choose and organize their facts
                    upon this basis. Since each period writes its own history, and since the Beardians are not satisfied
                    to write for their own generation, they must peer into the future and choose their
                    "principle of selection" by guessing what the future is to be. "The
                    historian must thus choose among the various possibilities of the present that tendency, that
                    predicted future, which he judges to be dynamic or controlling …. Since the future is not
                    foreseeable in detail—though many elements in it can be predicted, … the
                    historian's choice of a principle of selection necessarily involved a choice of allegiance,
                    an act of faith in one kind of future rather than another." To be logical, the authors of
                    the second chapter should have proposed university chairs of historical prediction to assist
                    historians in their knowledge of the future in order that they might write about the past.</p>
            <p>The conscious choice of a "principle of selection" is treated as though it would
                    overcome the demonstrated frailty of the poor historian to be biased, but it is more likely to add
                    one more bias. The emphasis placed upon his inability to escape his prejudices, hardly seems to be
                    the best method of overcoming them. How, may we ask, will the historian be helped in writing the
                    territorial history of Indiana by guessing that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is about to adopt laissez faire <pb n="416" id="VAA4025-042-4-120"/> or communism as a
                    national policy? Is it not better to study the records and write in as detached a manner
                    as possible what the records seem to reveal? Can we of the twentieth century write a
                    history of the past that will be acceptable to the twenty-first century?</p>
            <p>When we turn to the third chapter, we come to something very different. It is a review of historical
                    writing about the causes of the American Civil War. It demonstrates the frail ties of historians,
                    but it also reveals a growing realization of the complexity of causation, the broadening content of
                    history, and a more mature understanding of the problem. It also indicates that some historians have
                    been able to overcome the peculiar bias which they might be expected to show. The author, Howard K.
                    Beale, concludes "This study has encouraged the present writer … to believe that
                    the repeated of forts to discover the ‘truth’ about causes of the Civil War
                    have been fruitful and that both the methods and quality of history have improved in the period
                    analyzed." Additional studies of this type should be encouraged.</p>
            <p>The fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters are valuable. They contain a discussion of "The Need
                    for Greater Precision in the Use of Historical Terms," a series of propositions on
                    historical procedure, and a reading list. The propositions scarcely embody the Beardian ideas.</p>
            <p>Whether the report justifies the labor of such eminent, historians, as the committee members and the
                    authors, and the backing of such distinguished societies as the national associations of the
                    anthropologists, economists, historian:;, political scientists, psychologists, sociologists, and
                    statisticians. in addition to the Social Science Research Council, each reader may decide for
                    himself.</p>

            <p>Information concerning the activities of many of the American fur traders remains scattered,
                    conflicting, and vague. In view of this, the volume under review is most welcome because Donald
                    McKay Frost, the editor, has here brought together a number of items concerning the fur trading <pb n="417" id="VAA4025-042-4-121"/> exploits of the notable General William H. Ashley during the
                    year 1822 to 1826. Moreover, the editor has prefaced his selected materials with a 58-page foreword
                    containing comments on the accompanying documents, a critical estimate of the activities and
                    accomplishments of Ashley and his associates, and a sketch of American fur trading in general during
                    the years previously indicated.</p>
            <p>Republished here are three revealing letters of Daniel T. Potts which originally appeared in the <placeName>

            <p>The editor deserves praise for his careful workmanship and for the precise and interesting treatment

                    than he was in exploring. He was, however, a good organizer, and the men in his employ were those
