            <p>Indiana furnished an exceptional number of senior officers to the United States Navy in World War II,
                    and her sons were in the very forefront of the nation's battles, as casualty lists and
                    other records testify. The official summary of casualties of World War II for the Navy, Marine
                    Corps, and Coast Guard, covering officers and men, shows for Indiana 1,467 killed or died of wounds
                    resulting from combat, 32 others died in prison camps, 2,050 wounded, and 94 released prisoners of
                    war. There were in the Navy from Indiana 9,412 officers (of this number, probably about 6 percent or
                    555 were officers of the Regular Navy, about 10 percent or 894 were temporary officers promoted from
                    enlisted grades of the Regular Navy, and about 85 percent or 7,963 were Reserve officers) and 93,219
                    enlisted men, or a total of 102,631. In the Marine Corps a total of 15,360 officers and men were
                    from Indiana, while the Coast Guard had 229 officers and 3,556 enlisted men, for a total of 3,785
                    Hoosiers. Thus, the overall Indiana total for Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard was 121,776. By
                    way of comparison, there were about 258,870 Hoosiers in the Army.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> There is
                    nothing remarkable about the totals and Indiana's representation in the Navy was not
                    exceptional in quantity; but it was extraordinary in quality.</p>

                            that they are not precise, because the records used are not designed to emphasize home

                            by states. Even these records are not conclusive, however, and it has been necessary to

            <p>The Navy had four admirals<hi rend="sup">2</hi> on the active list at the outbreak of war and this
                    number increased to seven in November, 1944. Of the seven, three were from Indiana, Royal Eason
                    Ingersoll of LaPorte, Raymond Ames Spruance of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Ingersoll, born in 1883, was graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1905,
                    fourth in his class, after having won a competitive examination for appointment. A rear admiral in
                    1938, he served two years in command of a cruiser division, and then became assistant chief of naval
                    operations. He was made commander-in-chief of the Atlantic Fleet with the rank of vice admiral on
                    January 1, 1942, and advanced to the rank of admiral on July 1, 1942. In nearly three years as
                    commander-in-chief of the Atlantic Fleet he established an outstanding record in dealing with the
                    problems of the anti-submarine war and all of the manifold naval operations in the Atlantic area. He
                    had the responsibility for the delivery of a huge army in Europe and the safe convoy of all supplies
                    for the troops there. In November, 1944, he was made deputy commander-in-chief of the United States
                    Fleet and commander of the <geogName>Western Sea</geogName> Frontier, with headquarters in <placeName>

                                officers from Indiana, but could not furnish them; thus it was necessary to examine
                                individual records to provide the names of Indiana-born officers in these two branches.

                            and for three naval ranks that existed throughout World War II. These ranks are: admiral,
                            corresponding to general, with four stars as insignia; vice admiral, the equivalent of
                            lieutenant general three stars; rear admiral, ranking with major general, two stars; and
                            commodore, ranking with brigadier general, one star. Later a five-star rank was created:

                    rear admiral in 1940, after commanding the battleship "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>." He was commander of the <geogName>Caribbean Sea</geogName> Frontier, at

               </placeName>, and then had a cruiser division in the Pacific. At the decisive
                    Battle of Midway, June 4-6, 1942, he commanded a carrier task force. Soon afterward he became chief
                    of staff to the commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet, and in August, 1943, commander of the
                    Central Pacific Force, which designation was changed to commander of the Fifth Fleet in April, 1944.
                    He became vice admiral in 1943, and admiral in 1944. Thereafter he commanded in a series of
                    brilliant operations: the Gilbert Islands, November, 1943; <placeName>
                        <country reg="xe">Marshall Islands</country>

                    June 19-20, 1944; the capture of Iwo Jima, February, 1945; Okinawa, March-April, 1945. In this last
                    operation he commanded more than half a million men of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, 318
                    combatant ships, and 1,139 auxiliary vessels. Admiral Spruance used the heavy cruiser "<placeName>

                    Iwo Jima, in other operations, and in the early part of the Okinawa assault, until the ship was
                    disabled by a kamikaze plane. Following the Japanese surrender, Admiral Spruance replaced Admiral
                    Chester W. Nimitz as commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet and in 1946 became president of the

            <p>Many people believe that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was something hastily contrived in
                    the midst of the banking crisis of 1933, but nothing could be further from the truth.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The act which established a nationwide system of deposit insurance in 1933 was the 150th
                    such measure to be introduced in the Congress. The first attempt had been made in 1886, and similar
                    attempts were made in almost every succeeding Congress. In addition, a total of fourteen states had
                    established bank-obligation insurance plans prior to 1933; indeed, six such state plans had been
                    adopted before the Civil War.</p>
            <p>The first proposals for bank-obligation insurance<hi rend="sup">2</hi> were made soon after the
                    problem of bank failures became important. Not until 1809, after more than a quarter century of
                    banking, did the failure of the Farmers Bank of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Gloucester</settlement>, <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
               </placeName>, bring home to
                    many people the realization that such an event was possible. Another five years were to pass before
                    the first wave of bank failures took place in this country. It is indicative of the adaptability of
                    early American banking that by the middle 1830's two different systems of bank-obligation
                    insurance had been placed in operation.</p>

                    into an insurance fund maintained for the benefit of the creditors of participating banks which had
                        failed.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> In 1834 Indiana provided that individual banks were mutually to

                    independently, although it appears that Indiana did take into account the very

            <p>The apparently independent development of these two pioneer insurance plans possibly reflected the
                    very marked differences between the banking histories of the two states. When her safety fund act

                    of these charters provided an opportunity for the introduction of bank-obligation insurance.</p>
            <p>Indiana, on the other hand, had been without banks of any kind for some time prior to 1834 and, in
                    addition, was faced with the problem of a state constitution which prohibited banking except by a
                    state bank with branches.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The legislature nevertheless provided for the
                    creation of independent banks but, in apparent deference to the constitutional prohibition, required
                    that they be known as branch banks and that collectively they comprise the state bank. The president
                    and board of directors of the state bank were essentially a supervisory authority, and their
                    functions were thus similar to those of a present-day bank commissioner and banking board.</p>

                    the most severe depressions this nation has ever undergone, insurance systems were operating in four
                    states: three of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> variety and Indiana's mutual guaranty system. Six years later, when the
                    depression had run its course, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> system was found to have disintegrated, the insurance fund in <placeName>

                    </placeName> had proved inadequate to meet all the claims of creditors of banks which had failed,
                    and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> system had been seriously weakened.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Indiana's banks, with only one exception, had come through the great
                    depression successfully and the insurance system had worked well. By 1845 the Indiana banking system
                    was without parallel in the West and ranked with the strongest in the nation.</p>
            <p>Before continuing the account of the adoption of bank-obligation insurance by other states, it is
                    important to inquire into the role of insurance in the successful operation of the Indiana banking
                    system during the depression. In other words, would Indiana banks, and bank creditors, have fared
                    just as well if there had been no mutual guaranty system? Probably not: without the insurance system
                    the failure rate of Indiana banks would very likely have been as high as that of banks in
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The most important reason for the successful operation of the Indiana banking system was the
                    relationship between its insurance plan and bank supervision. It goes almost without saying that
                    insurance of bank obligations can never be successful without thorough supervision; the trick is to
                    assure that both can be had at the same time. Perhaps inadvertently, but more probably by design,
                    Indiana solved this problem by making the supervisory body, the board of directors of the state
                    bank, consist largely of representatives from each of <list type="footnotes">

                    could have been disastrous, since one bank might have been willing to overlook the misdeeds of
                    another, in return for the same favor to itself. But since the banks were also tied together in an
                    insurance plan which provided for assessments to meet the obligations of a failing member, the
                    result was that each bank could best protect its interests by seeing to it that no other bank
                    reached a position which would endanger the rest. To put it another way, the insurance system gave
                    each participating bank a stake in the sound operation of every other Indiana bank, while the
                    supervisory structure gave it the power to enforce its interests.</p>
            <p>There are many illustrations of the efficacy of this arrangement: in the type of examination given
                    the banks, in the general attitude of supervisory officials toward unsafe and unsound banking, and
                    finally in the action taken in the case of Indiana's one distressed bank. The records of
                    the state bank system testify to the range and to the penetrating quality of the inquiries which
                    examiners were to make of each bank. That the examinations themselves were excellently conducted is
                    the testimony of one of the great bankers produced by the Indiana system, Hugh McCulloch, who became
                    the first Comptroller of the Currency of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. In his early years McCulloch was cashier of the Fort Wayne branch bank and he later
                    wrote that the examinations were "(so searching and thorough that fraud and mismanagement
                    could scarcely have escaped detection."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>To one who has studied the activities of banks during this period in all of the middle western
                    states, the policy of the Indiana banks, as formulated by the supervisory officials, appears
                    exceptional. To cite only a few examples: excessively large loans to directors and stockholders were
                    carefully watched by the board and by Samuel Merrill, president of the state bank. One of his
                    letters to a branch bank will serve to illustrate this attitude: "… though it
                    may not be wrong to loan money to a director… for some useful object in the same manner
                    as would be allowed to others… if Directors are suffered to renew their notes without
                    curtailing, the reason for such proceeding should appear on the minutes… <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Loans on real estate were another source of difficulty for early western banks, especially in this
                    period because until the panic in 1837 a real estate boom of major proportions had flourished in the
                    western states. Many western banks deliberately became involved in this boom, with its highly
                    speculative overtones, but not the Indiana banks. The attitude of the president of the largest <placeName>

                    </placeName> bank provides an interesting contrast with that of Merrill at this time. In 1836, at
                    the height of the boom, the <placeName>

                    that Merrill advised the branch banks: "… as we have no difficulty in securing
                    loans on… property not subject to such variations in price we reject in all cases where
                    there is any suspicion of a high valuation and in general we take no town lots unless in very
                    special cases."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A final example of the effect of combining the insurance principle with a plan for effective
                    supervision was the case of the Lawrenceburgh branch bank, which was placed in the hands of
                    receivers in the fall of 1843. For some years previous to its financial difficulties, supervisory
                    officials had criticized the management of the Lawrenceburgh bank. It is highly significant that
                    when the bank was closed the action was taken at the insistence of the other banks, through their
                    representatives on the board. This is shown by the fact that, shortly before the board took action
                    in the Lawrence-burgh case, Merrill wrote to one of its officers: "… some <list type="footnotes">

            <p>There is one interesting footnote to this Lawrenceburgh case. After the bank was closed it was
                    decided that a loan or a deferred deposit—which of the two cannot be definitely
                    determined from the evidence—would enable the bank to resume operations. Consequently,
                    the necessary funds were contributed by the sound participating banks and, after a change in
                    management, the bank reopened for business. Eventually it became one of the strongest banks in the
                    system.</p>
            <p>An analysis of the performance of the four insurance systems during the great depression of the late
                    1830's and early 1840's shows clearly that the results did not provide a test of
                    the two types of insurance, insurance fund and mutual guaranty. What really accounted for the
                    difference in performance was management and timing. For example, almost no type of insurance system
                    could have survived in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, since it would have been placed in operation less than twelve months before the panic.
                    Furthermore, had <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s system received the quality of management that was given Indiana's
                    it might have come through the depression with little difficulty.</p>
            <p>However this may be, contemporaries saw only that of the four insurance systems Indiana's
                    appeared to have worked best. Consequently it was the Hoosier example which was followed in the next
                    stage of the development of bank-obligation insurance.</p>

                    thirty-four banks operating at the beginning of the depression, only eight remained six years later.
                    In many cases the banks had failed, while in others the charters had expired. Because the

                    </placeName> insurance system, in the event of a bank failure participating banks were to be
                    assessed for the requisite amounts as soon as creditors' claims were established and the
                    banks were then to be repaid from the insurance fund. As a matter of fact, although there were ten

            <p>During the decade following the Civil War, as the theater grew and prospered, many cities and towns,
                    including <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, maintained local stock companies which furnished support for the stars engaged by the
                    local managers who usually went personally to <placeName>

                    </placeName> to select talent for the ensuing season. "When stock companies were the rule
                    and not the exception, … both plays and actors placed their dependence in dramatic merit
                    and not in stage accessories. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> at that time supported a stock company, some of the members of which have since become
                    famous in the profession. They were under-paid and overworked, for in those days there was a change
                    of bill almost nightly, and frequently in a two weeks' engagement as many as twenty
                    different plays were produced, and when members of a company were not actually engaged in a
                    performance they were busy, either at rehearsal or at their study. A good actor to get an engagement
                    must have an extensive repertoire, a very ‘quick study’ as it is technically
                    called, a wardrobe that could be utilized for either tragedy, comedy or farce, and be able to go on
                    the stage and get through a part, after having seen it only a few hours before. It was the almost
                    invariable custom to give a double bill every night. For instance, such long plays as
                    ‘Hamlet,’ ‘Macbeth’ or ‘King Leaf’
                    would be either preceded or followed by a farce, generally described as
                    ‘roaring,’ the evident purpose of which was to display the versatility of the
                    star and his support. Frequently two comedies were given, and it was not until as late as 1868 or
                    1870 that the custom of giving only one play became prevalent. Stars had no companies in those days,
                    but they were supported by the stock wherever they appeared, and they received from 15 to 25 per
                    cent. of the gross receipts of every performance and a so-called ‘benefit,’

                    per week. Occasionally an actor and his actress wife played leads together and their combined salary
                    might range from $40.00 to $75.00. There was always the possibility of an

            <p>The depression which settled down over business activities in 1876-1877 resulted in small audiences
                    and unsuccessful productions. Theaters were closed for occasional periods, and newspaper notices of
                    performances in the 1876-1878 seasons were scarce. Apparently the Metropolitan enjoyed more
                    prosperity than the others, for its variety shows were announced regularly. In order to draw
                    audiences, both the Grand (built in 1875) and the Academy of Music resorted to engaging types of
                    shows similar to the variety performances at the Metropolitan. For example, the Grand announced the

            <p>Hard times may have had a bad effect on theater audiences of the decade, or perhaps the period was
                    not highly cultivated. In 1875 a writer for the <hi rend="i">News</hi> offered this criticism:
                    "There has not been a night at either of the two leading places of amusement for the past
                    two weeks but what some portions of the audience have been annoyed and their attention distracted
                    from the stage by the muttered comments of ill-bred people in their immediate neighborhood. During
                    the ‘Two Orphans’ at the Academy, night after night, there were those who had
                    seen it elsewhere, a fact soon made patent to every one occupying contiguous seats, and they being
                    interested only in the climaxes, contented themselves with commenting upon ‘how much
                    different it was there than here,’ or other matters equally irrelevant and excessively
                    annoying to those to whom each feature of the drama was a charming spectacle. Saturday night, at the
                    Opera House, well dressed parties, careless or perhaps ignorant of the common rules of etiquette,
                    were excessively annoying with muttered speech, continuous in every scene, and only drowned from ear
                    when Hamlet with his powerful voice rolled out those glorious bursts of rhetoric with which the play
                    abounds. These disturbances are of nightly occurrence, and they come from a class of people of whom
                    better things are expected; and yet who, by just such gross violation, show themselves ignorant and
                    uncultivated, and deficient in those impulses which make the natural gentleman or gentlewoman. A
                    hoodlum at the same place would have more regard for the rights of those surrounding him than do
                    these people, and would show more courtesy to the square inch in one hour, in this regard, than the
                    class above mentioned during an entire evening. The evil has become a crying one, and is on the
                    increase, for the ushers and ‘grand bouncers’ of these respective
                    establishments, keen to correct a fellow if his foot protrudes beyond a supposed horizon, or to
                    bounce an ill-dressed person if he shows signs of intoxication, are loth to interfere with showy
                    broadcloth, or shining head trimmings, and therefore virtually license the most troublesome class of
                    the two to do just about as they please. No <list type="footnotes">

                    steps as will break up this unpleasant and inexcusable business. The enforcement of the
                    ‘grand bounce’ would soon work a remedy, and a ‘Bogardus

            <p>Perhaps the theater was suffering a general decline, but Barney Macauley of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> blamed newspapers, Sunday night concerts, and variety theaters for cultivating low
                        tastes.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Conversely, the attitude of the public was doubtless responsible in
                    part for the introduction of poor, even low types of performances. In 1876 Matt Morgan's
                    Art Exhibition at the Grand Opera House was said to display beautiful women posed in living pictures
                    which represented scenes in nature and art. The characters appeared in a somewhat undressed state,
                    and the audiences were almost entirely men. The newspaper critic insisted the performance was
                    artistic and not necessarily immoral, as some charged.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That winter the city council sought to institute reform without passing specifically on the moral
                    quality of shows by prohibiting Sunday evening performances. Soon the Matt Morgan troupe made
                    another appearance, at the Metropolitan and on a Sunday night. This was to be a test case for the
                    Sunday blue law, and the police dutifully raided the theater. During that first raid, as officers
                    moved into the theater, the actors tried to carry on with the show until the orchestra leader
                    disappeared under the stage, a bass fiddle went sailing for the galleries, and a policeman sprawled
                    into the footlights. Then the manager rang down the curtain and announced that the show was over.
                    Twenty-five actors were arrested and a crowd followed them to the police station. The following
                    Sunday the Metropolitan was raided again. Many had come to this performance or stood outside to
                    watch the fun, but the police were more efficient this time, and the raid was carried on so quietly
                    that the audience was not aware of what was happening. Although the actors were all <list type="footnotes">

            <p>City authorities tried in other ways to control questionable shows and theaters by requiring a

                    attempt to raise the license fee for so-called "concert saloons" to
                        $100.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> One type of show engendered no ill will nor desire to
                    restrict or curtail its activity. The "greatest show on earth," Phineas T.

            <p>In spite of efforts to place a stamp of approval on certain types of shows and disapproval on others,
                    the burlesque and minstrel continued to thrive. Their variety nature gave opportunity for all sorts
                    of elements to be displayed. If some acts were risqué or immoral, others were doubtless
                    above reproach. It is well known that through the years these shows gave opportunity for young,
                    inexperienced actors to get a start and served as stepping stones to better things. Cultured and
                    intellectual people, particularly women, rarely patronized the burlesque, whose audiences usually
                    consisted of men of the working classes, salesmen, traveling men, and some stage people.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Certainly the actor's elementary school was in many respects a

            <p>In 1879 the Metropolitan was remodelled again and rechristened the Park Theater. The front was
                    altered by the addition of a stairway, the roof was raised, and a dome added. Inside, new boxes were
                    installed with the latest style opera chairs, the stage was enlarged, and new scenery and stage
                    props secured. In spite of all these changes, the acoustics, which had been a remarkable feature of
                    the theater from the beginning, were preserved. It was said to be extremely neat, comfortable,
                    elegant, and artistic, and was now to be a legitimate theater. The opening on September 19, 1879,
                    presented the incomparable Joseph Jefferson as Rip Van Winkle, and the managers, James B. and George
                    A. Dickson, journeyed east to complete engagements for the coming season.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

            <p>During this period misfortune was the lot of the Academy of Music. When in 1875 the lease of William
                    H. Leake and James B. Dickson expired, a new and aggressive manager, Daniel Macauley, took charge.
                    Before Leake departed as manager he was tendered a final benefit which stirred the emotions of many
                    in the audience. Since 1868 he had been both a good manager and an actor. Now as he took his
                    departure tender words were spoken, and Dan Macauley presented him with a gold-headed cane, a gift
                    from the orchestra. "There were real, unmistakable tears in Leake's eyes as he
                    thanked the musicians for the unexpected compliment."<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>Then a grand remodelling program for the Academy ensued. The stage was enlarged, the whole interior

            <p>Then on January 27, 1877, the Academy became a smoking ruin in the space of two hours. Fire was
                    discovered and an alarm sent in about 9:30 that evening. Apparently no audience was in the theater,
                    though had one been present it would have had time for a safe exit since the fire seemed to start
                    slowly. Once under way it burned furiously, and by 11:30 nothing but bare, blackened walls remained.
                    Frozen fire plugs had effectively delayed the work of the fire department. In 1868 Valentine Butsch
                    had paid $113,000 beyond the original purchase price of $40,000 to complete
                    construction of the building as a theater. Purchased by Nicholas Ruckle in 1874 for
                    $140,000 and redecorated in 1875 at an added cost of $20,000, it was now a
                    total loss. Encumbrances on the building at the time of its destruction totalled $75,000,
                    only $57,250 of which were covered by insurance. The cause of the fire was said to be a
                    defective flue, but some hinted at incendiarism.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> The hard times which had

            <p>The Grand Opera House (now Keith's Theater) was built in about one hundred days during the
                    summer of 1875 and was ready for its opening by mid-September. Designed by Wallace Hume and built by
                    the Dickson brothers at a cost of $48,000 or $50,000, it was generously
                    evaluated by the audience on the opening night as one of the best seated, best lighted, best
                    decorated, and best appointed places of amusement extant. Two elaborate chandeliers, one on either

                    had a good view of the stage. James Dickson managed the theater with the help of Ed Harvey, scenic

            <p>In December, 1876, Edward H. Sothern came to <placeName>

                    </placeName> in <hi rend="i">Lord Dundreary</hi> and was pronounced excellent. Later that season
                    Lawrence Barrett and Denman Thompson appeared. These actors were more highly regarded than others
                    who came to the city, for up to that date they were the only ones noted to have been engaged for an
                    entire week's performance at a time. Barrett had played for a week in March, 1874, and for
                    several appearances in September that year, but did not come again until April and November, 1877,
                    in the autumn of 1878, and in December, 1879. He was regarded as the best Richelieu of the American
                    stage and usually included that play in his repertoire; his other performances were devoted to
                    Shakespeare. He did not always command large audiences, and a frank critic suggested that he was so
                    artificial and so reserved that he could never be accused of overplaying a role.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is doubtful whether such criticisms greatly affected the size of audiences. One writer
                    commented: "That the frequent admission of variety shows to the Grand opera house has
                    lowered the tone of the audience which is attracted there seems undeniable. While there was a large
                    element of culture and appreciation in the audience last night, it was evident that to the larger
                    proportion the play was comparatively new. This was shown by the applause bestowed upon the text of
                    the play instead of the good points made by the actors. Thus the pleasantries of the grave digger
                    were applauded much as a fresh gag would be at the Metropolitan, while but for the loud-palmed
                    claquers stationed near the entrance some of Mr. Barrett's best acting would have been
                    applauded only by the quiet and appreciative few who love art and good acting well enough to enjoy
                    it anywhere. When the opera house is the only place here exclusively devoted to the drama, it seems
                    a pity that it can not be kept from defilement <list type="footnotes">

                    $1.00, but many in the balcony sold at a premium of three times their original price. His
                    acting was as admirable as always, and his songs were sung with the same sweetness. According to a

                    Victorians. A critic pointed out that "as long as the New York Weekly and the Dime Novels

                    illegitimate in its most offensive sense, will draw a crowd. But for this state of things public

            <p>The activity of the legitimate theater and of the local stock company left its impression on the
                    cultural scene of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but how much and what kind is somewhat uncertain. Evidently few <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> young people turned to the professional stage, though considerable encouragement was no
                    doubt provided for the amateur theatricals which were popular entertainment during the seventies.
                    The Indianapolis Dramatic Society, the third dramatic club in the city's history, was
                    organized November 19, 1872, with twenty-two members, eleven men and eleven women. The only juvenile
                    member was Fanny Ramsay Wilder, who was eighteen at the time the club was organized. The moving
                    spirits were Austin H. Brown and Daniel Macauley, who later became manager of the Academy of Music.
                    Macauley and Kate Tousey, who went on the stage in the eighties, were the only members of the
                    Dramatic Society who were known to have had professional connections. The others continued to
                    maintain an amateur status. Brown voiced the opinion that participation in an amateur group was a
                    sort of insurance to prevent anyone from wishing to turn professional. The society gave plays,
                    usually for charitable purposes, until March, 1878, when it suspended activities, not to become
                    reorganized and operative again until 1890. Performances by the group were generally well attended
                    so that charitable work was benefited and the actors were encouraged. This activity must have proved
                    a boon to some as hard times became evident. In January, 1875, the <hi rend="i">News</hi> stated:
                    "Home amusements are unusually frequent this winter. In the absence of club dances and gay
                    parties, our people are directing their powers to amuse toward presenting masquerades, scriptural
                    opera and the drama." Often other clubs in the city, such as the Cecilian Glee Club and
                    Lyra Orchestra, assisted the Dramatic Society in giving a complete entertainment.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

            <p>An amateur effort not connected with the Dramatic Society was the 1875 production of <hi rend="i">The
                        Spy,</hi> which had been dramatized by Katharine Merrill and a Mrs. Harrison in the interests of
                    the Centennial fund. Four performances were given, but so few attended that it was a financial
                    failure and the management of the Academy of Music admitted a loss of $500.00 on the
                    venture. Perhaps the presentation of <hi rend="i">The Black Crook</hi> at the Metropolitan at the
                    same time affected the attendance.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> In 1879 performances of the North End
                    Dramatic Club were held at the residence of Anna Butler on Home Avenue. Since no further evidence of
                    this club is available, its life was probably short.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the close of the decade no outstanding amateur dramatic group functioned. The destruction of the
                    Academy of Music in 1877 left only the Metropolitan, a variety theater, and the Grand, the only
                    legitimate theater, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. As the Dickson brothers assumed a monopoly of the theatrical field, they rechristened
                    the Metropolitan the New Park and transformed it into a legitimate theater. This situation no doubt
                    challenged William H. English and influenced his decision to build another theater in 1880.</p>

            <p>With ample justification Stewart Holbrook declared in his book, <hi rend="i">Lost Men of American
                        History,</hi> that Harvey W. Wiley was one of the most influential Americans of the twentieth
                        century.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> This judgment is based upon Wiley's successful efforts,
                    as chief of the Bureau of Chemistry of the United States Department of Agriculture, to obtain the
                    enactment of the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906 and to arouse public consciousness of the
                    importance of honest labeling. "American stomachs and insides generally have been better
                    than they would have been had Wiley not lived and labored."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Almost half of Wiley's life was spent in Indiana, where he was born October 18, 1844, on a
                    farm in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson County</region>
                    </placeName>, about six miles from the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. When Fort Sumter was
                    attacked in 1861, he was between sixteen and seventeen years old and was therefore too young to
                    enlist unless he falsified his age. In his autobiography, which was published shortly before his
                    death, Wiley related: "I was a big husky youth, and could easily have passed for eighteen,
                    but because of my parental training in truthfulness I would not swear falsely as to my
                        age."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> His youth, however, did not prevent him from enrolling,
                    along with his father, in a local cavalry company of the Indiana Legion, a home guard organization.
                    General John Morgan's<hi rend="sup">4</hi> raids into Indiana in July, 1863, gave the
                    Legion an opportunity to see some action, and Wiley's company joined in the pursuit of
                    Morgan, who was able, however, to reach <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> before the Legion could catch him.</p>
            <p>In April, 1863, Wiley informed his father that he wished to go to college. Having received his
                    father's consent, he went to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, but his career there was interrupted in 1864 when he, along with some other <placeName>

                    </placeName> by Page J. Pickerell, Jonathan T. Summers, Alexander C. Thorn, and John W. Verry. On
                    May 14, 1864, it went into Camp Carrington at Indian-polis; and on the following day Pickerell was
                    elected captain, Summers first lieutenant, and Thorn second lieutenant.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                    Wiley's company spent almost all of its active service at <placeName>

            <p>In his diary Wiley recorded his impressions about Tullahoma, its people, and its military importance.
                    An intelligent observer, he also commented on such topics as the peculiarities of the local weather
                    and terrain, picket duty, camp morals, correspondence with his family, his case of measles, and a
                    joyful Fourth of July picnic. The period covered by the diary begins with the entry for May 30 and
                    concludes with that of September 17, 1864.</p>

                        <p>Peculiar are the circumstances under which I write. A former time I was an
                                    unoffensive youth and a student. Now I am a <hi rend="i">dangerous</hi> animal, in
                                    fact a "brave soldier boy." I had intended to write from the day
                                    of my enlistment but was unable to procure a book untill this morning, when this was
                                    obtained at the small price of 30 cts. at the sutlers "long may they
                                    wave." Two weeks and two day[s] have elapsed since we went into camp at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and during this time I have been gradualy seeing the Military Elephant
                                    in all his grand proportions and in every position.</p>
                        <p>Camp life agrees with me in every respect physicaly. I get fat on Uncle
                                    Sam's bread, meat and coffee and like it better every day. The mental and
                                    moral elements are not so predominant as the physical; yet we have a prayer meeting
                                    nearly every day which is well attended and chances to read the Bible as much as you
                                    want to. The great want is for something to do, but this will probaly be remedied
                                    when we get to some permanent station for the regulations prescribe 4 hours drill a
                                    day; and this would about employ our spare time. The rest of the time we can devote
                                    to reading what little literature we can procure, writing. …</p>
                        <p>These are nice quarters. We have here a whole reg't. in one house with
                                    plenty of room, well ventilated, a writing desk and rack for the muskets to each
                                    bunk. The only objections that I could raise to them is that instead of solid boards
                                    to lay on, there is only slats, some of which persist in bending in unpleasant
                                    proximity to one's back bone and ribs; yet the slats have their advantages,
                                    giving a more perfect ventilation and more vacillating bed.</p>

                                    compensates for all the hardships and a consciousness of doing what we ought to is

                        <p>Taylor Barracks May 31</p>
                        <p>It is nearly dinner time now, and we have not left here yet and more than that we
                                    have no orders to go as I know of. The orders are very strict here. Even a Colonel
                                    can't get out without a pass, and it is next to impossible for any one
                                    without shoulder straps to get a pass. I am sorry of this; for I wanted to go down
                                    to town and get some Photographs struck off before my uniform got soiled, but I
                                    guess I can't succeed.</p>
                        <p>This is a delightful day neither too hot nor too cold. With a bright sunshine giving
                                    life and vigor to everything. The quarters are tastefully arranged. A nice yard
                                    thickly set with blue grass too each row of barracks. I was somewhat surprised on
                                    coming here at the absense of hills such as I was accoustoumed to see along the
                                    river. The country is apparently level on both sides of the river as far as you can
                                    see.</p>
                        <p>Dinner is now ready. All our rations are cooked for us here by a brigade of darkies.
                                    All we have to do is to go after them and then devour as much as possible.</p>

                                    after the[y] receive the direct order to go. I seen a new part of the
                                    "Elephant" today viz. a squad of Negro<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                                    soldiers drilling. They did a great deal better than many white troops I have seen
                                    with the same opportunities. Their instructor was also an American citizen of
                                    African descent. There is another regiment of Indiana troops here now. The 138
                                    arrived yesterday afternoon. There is also one company of veteran troops in camp and

                        <p>Wednesday, June 1st</p>
                        <p>As I expected, the command for us to remove our quarter[s] to some more Southern
                                    clime was not carried into execution yesterday; and at ten o'clock A.M.,
                                    the time of the present writing, we are still here. The day being very warm I have
                                    left my bunk and am laying in the shade of the camp fence enjoying myself hugely. We
                                    may leave here today, but I think it is rather doubtful. All I hate about being in
                                    camp here is that I don't have any chance of look[ing] around. The fence is
                                    built of boards and very high. So you can't see anything but a few spires
                                    of some of the churches or other buildings of the city and a few of the surrounding
                                    trees.</p>
                        <p>The boys have a heap of fun at each other's expense, perpetrating all manner
                                    of jokes on the unsuspecting. There is rarely any ill-will manifested at any kind of
                                    a sell, no matter how bad the victim has been fooled.</p>
                        <p>There are so many troops in camp now that we have a great deal of trouble in getting
                                    our ration at the proper time. We had to wait until nearly eight o'clock
                                    this morning for our breakfast, and when it did come the coffee was simply a little
                                    colored warm water "but sich is life."</p>

                                    </placeName> about sundown last night and have had a very pleasant ride so far. We
                                    are now just inside of the Tenn. line. Have stopped along side of a train of rebel
                                    prisoners going north. They are as hard a looking set as you could find anywhere
                                    without uniforms, blankets or anything else. Our boys are now holding a confab with

                                    out on the commons where we had intended to have encamped for the night, but a
                                    violent rainstorm arose, which our commanders with great strategy suffered us to

                                    and then as there was not one of us who knew how to pitch his tent, they wisely
                                    concluded to bring us here.</p>
                        <p>The house was formerly a hotel built and owned by the rebel General Zollicoffer.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Our whole Reg't. is quartered in it and plenty of

                        <p>All the way, from a few miles this side of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, to 10 or 11 miles of here the clay was of the deepest red; and the
                                    road at a distance gave the appearance of being covered with tan bark. Another
                                    uncommon thing was the almost universal prevalence of the sassafras shroub,
                                    thousands of acres of improved land being covered with it. I saw many fields planted
                                    in corn, in which I could hardly see the ground. I didn't see a school
                                    house on the whole route. Every four or five miles there would be a fine house, the
                                    residence of some wealthy planter. In the distance a row of Negro quarters and now
                                    and then a low dirty hovel, surrounded by half naked little children and a
                                    reg't. or two of dogs, marked the dwelling place of the "poor
                                    white trash."</p>
                        <p>At every bridge there is a stockade and a small guard to protect them from being
                                    burned by the Rebels. A single company of men in one of these stockades can defend
                                    themselves against three times there number with ease.</p>
                        <p>At different places along the road are groups of refugees, the most dejected and
                                    abandoned people that I ever saw. They have made themselves all kinds of shelters.
                                    Often the hovels are simply made as big square as clapboards. Contraband are also
                                    numerous, and after we get into Tenn. the only happy looking people that I saw.</p>

                                    </placeName> was the soldiers' cemetery in the southern suburbs of the
                                    city. Here sleep thousand[s] of brave boys laying as close together as possible,
                                    each grave marked with a nice white board at the head &amp; foot, marked with

                                    since I left home that made me feel bad. As one approached the battlefield of

                                    been in earnest. Trees were twisted about in all directions, and the bark was peeled
                                    off from the bottom up as high as 20 or 25 feet with musket balls. Long lines of
                                    graves show where the Union and Rebel dead are buried. There is a monument between
                                    the railroad and pike where the hottest fight was and where the most men were
                                    killed. Although I knew very well that the battle of <geogName>Stone
                                    River</geogName> was fought on the ground, yet I could not realize then, nor cannot
                                    yet, that the battle was fought here.</p>
                        <p>Murfreesborough is considerable of a town. The greatest attractions about, however,
                                    is the fortifications which are truly formidable. The[y] were begun by Bragg<hi rend="sup">12</hi> before the battle of <geogName>Stone River</geogName> and

                                    strong they are comparatively, but I should hate to be one of those who would have
                                    to storm them. Many other traces of battle are visible which it is not necessary to

                        <p>I am detailed for patrol duty today. All I have to do is every 3d two hours to walk
                                    slowly through the town &amp; camp, preserve order, arest suspicious looking
                                    individuals, etc. The duty is light, and all I don't like about it is
                                    getting up in the night.</p>
                        <p>When the sun shines out brightly here, it is easy to realize you are in a southern
                                    clime. It is about as hot here now as it ever gets in Indiana. As I get to stay in

                        <p>There was a nice rain begining about noon today, which materialy reduced the

                        <p>I am well again today, the starving process having proved to be a complete cure.
                                    Others that were not as sick are yet invalids, many of them worse. Nevertheless,
                                    medicine is still in requisition and taken with a faith that cannot be accounted

                                    The wells are very deep and the continual drawing keeps them muddy. There is only
                                    one little creek some half mile away where there is any chance to bathe.</p>

                        <p>Expected to go on duty today but was agreeably disapointed. The Lieut. said I was to
                                    go on a surveying expedition, but it has not started yet. I hope I will get to go
                                    with it if there is one.</p>
                        <p>We now have four drill per day. Also dress parade at 7 o'clock in the
                                    evening. The 23 Mo. which has been encamped here for sometime left for the front
                                    this morning. The only troops here now besides our Reg't. are the 4th Ky.
                                    Battery and one Co. of the 71 O[hio]. If the Rebs want to make an attack on us, now
                                    is the time for them to pitch in. I hardly believe, though, that there will ever be
                                    an attack here; for there could be several thousand troops here in a few hours.</p>
                        <p>Quite a sad accident occured in camp this afternoon. Our second Lieut. accidently
                                    killed the Orderly Sergeant of the Co. quartered next to us with his revolver.
                                    Supposing all were out, he playfully pointed it at him, telling him that he intended
                                    to shoot him. The remark proved only too true, and <pb n="148" id="VAA4025-051-2-062"/> he immediatel[y] expired with a ball through his brain.
                                    The Lieut. who was the inocent cause of the murder delivered himself up but was
                                    released on parole and allowed the privileges of the camp.</p>
                        <p>Thursday, June 9th</p>
                        <p>It is considerably cooler too day, wind N.W. with broken clouds obscuring the sun,
                                    rendering the atmosphere remarkably pleasant.</p>
                        <p>If I was to stay in the army long, I would learn to be an early riser; for we have to
                                    be up every morning at half past four or else go on extra duty the rest of the day.
                                    There are also eight roil calls per day, at every one of which those not on duty
                                    must answer to their names. On account of this, the men do not have any opportunity
                                    to stroll away from camp.</p>
                        <p>I was detailed to go to <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, but owing to the fact that I was previously detailed for the survey
                                    which may start any time I was not allowed to go. I think, however, I will yet get
                                    to go to <placeName>

                        <p>The companies of the Reg't. were lettered today. Our Company is I. After we
                                    were lettered, we had to move our quarters so that we could take the same position
                                    in camp that we would occupy in the Reg't. No letter from home yet.</p>

                                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, it would be strange indeed.</p>
                        <p>From passers by this morning I have learned the name of the county that we are in,
                                    said name being "Coffee." I asked several about it so as to be
                                    sure, and some of them were so ignorant that they didn't know.</p>
                        <p>The inhabitants almost without exception are dressed in the irrepressible
                                    "Butternut." Some few, however, have their
                                    "jeans" colored gray in imitation of the Rebel uniform.</p>
                        <p>A fellow just now came along who wanted to go and take the "oath."
                                    I sent one of the pickets along with him for that purpose. After he takes the
                                    "oath" he can get a pass to <pb n="149" id="VAA4025-051-2-063"/>
                                    go at large, for ten days after that time is out he either has to get it renewed or
                                    else stay at home, just as he pleases. I have three men with me; and we will have to
                                    stand picket for twenty-four hours, keeping watch alternately.</p>
                        <p>Received a letter from home day before yesterday, which done me an immense amount of
                                    good as I hadn't heard from the folks for over three weeks. I
                                    wouldn't object too three or four letters a week from home. Wrote a letter
                                    home yesterday, which made two for one week.</p>
                        <p>I was down at the grave yard yesterday and saw two soldiers buried. One from Mo. and
                                    one from Ky. Owing to the hardness of the ground, the undertaker said that at the
                                    depth of four feet (the regulation depth for burying the dead) a body would never
                                    decay. Tis almost like encasing in solid rock.</p>
                        <p>I must wait now till something "turns up" so that I can continue
                                    the writing.</p>
                        <p>6 P.M.</p>
                        <p>I had expected that my supper would be sent out to me, but in this I was
                                    disappointed. But owing to a fortunate circumstance, I did not suffer. One of the
                                    boys hearing a disturbance out in the brush took his gun and went out to we if he
                                    could di[s]cover the cause. In this he was eminently successful, said cause being
                                    about twenty pigs, wild and fat. The report of a musket was heard by us who had
                                    remained, soon after he had left the camp and then all was still. In dread suspense
                                    we awaited the final result, but were not long kept in doubt. In about half an
                                    [h]our our hero returned bearing as the fruits of his victory the hind quarters of a
                                    good sised [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] pig. It evidently had no owner, for there was no
                                    mark of any kind about it. We immediately sent one of our number to camp for a
                                    frying pan and some salt, which being obtained, we immediately proceeded to get and
                                    eat our supper.</p>
                        <p>Tuesday, June 14th</p>
                        <p>8 o'clock A.M. Our time will soon be out. Now the relief is probaly already
                                    on its way. During the night we saw "nary [a] Reb" nor no other
                                    person. If it just wasn't for staying awake, I would just about as leave
                                    stand picket as not.</p>
                        <p>The citizens say they scarcely ever knew such cold weather in the summertime as there
                                    is here now. I know by sad experience that the nights are extremely chilly and
                                    before morning without good covering are realy uncomfortable.</p>

                        <p>Thursday, June 16th 5 o'clock in the morning</p>
                        <p>I was on picket again last night and yesterday and will be untill 9 o'clock
                                    today. Am just opposite where I was the other time on the same road. Yesterday
                                    morning the picket guard was doubled and very stringent instructions were given them
                                    not to let any one pass in the day time without a pass and at night without the
                                    countersign. These instructions were rigidly enforced along the ground where I was
                                    on duty.</p>
                        <p>At this post there are 1 Lieut. &amp; 10 men, three men remaining on duty at a
                                    time. About the only events of interest transpiring here are the capturing and
                                    shooting of "bushwhackers," some being shot nearly every day. The
                                    authorities seem to think this the only way of putting a stop to such practices and
                                    no doubt it is. Yet it seems like peculiar operations to me when in the evening late
                                    I hear a volley of musketry and know that one or more Rebels are no more. Yet these
                                    are every day occurrences and have almost ceased to be talked about.</p>
                        <p>The two Reg'ts. of Tenn. Cav. that are camped here, which bring in these
                                    fellows, kill a great many on the spot where they are captured without any form of
                                    trial what ever. The most of them are East Tennesseans and have had their property
                                    destroyed and their friends slain by the Rebels. If they had their way about it,
                                    they would show no quarter; but they are restrained in some degree by their
                                    officers.</p>
                        <p>Friday, June 17</p>
                        <p>Considerably warmer today, and I am glad of it, not because I would wish the days to
                                    be warmer so much as the nights. These have been continuously cool for the last week
                                    or two, causing great discomfort among the pickets.</p>
                        <p>Am on picket again today. Was not very well this morning but feel better now. This is
                                    not as nice a place for a picket post as the others I have been on. There is only a
                                    single tree for a shade, and it keeps us moving all the time to keep pace with the
                                    shadow. The heat now, however, is less intent for the "Bright luminary of
                                    day" is sinking in all the magnificence of superabundant loveliness in the
                                    western horizon, tinging all nature with unuterable beauty sublimity. (N.B. This is
                                    poetical). I think now I had better quit after such an outburst.</p>

                        <p>Saturday Morn., June 18th</p>
                        <p>I hear the drums beating at camp for guard mounting. So we have a prospect of being
                                    relieved very soon. The greatest objection I have to this post is its proximity to
                                    the small pox hospital, the distance being not more than fifty yards. The
                                    convalescents are also taking the liberty to run around at large with their polluted
                                    clothes. This is another source of anger to the sentinels stationed here.</p>
                        <p>Monday, June 20</p>
                        <p>A pleasant evening this, after a sultry day, threatning a storm the time but never
                                    executing. And even now a black rain cloud in the east forbades by its occasional
                                    mutterings, a violent storm in some portion of our distracted country. But that does
                                    not in the least disturb me; for with my physical system in a good condition, as
                                    good at least as could be expected in camp, I can lose myself as it were in my
                                    mental being and my mind free from all care of bodily things can soor untrameled in
                                    the inexhoutable fields of thought and gather there material for present and future

                        <p>Well the rain has begun sure enough and with an energy that reminds us of high creeks
                                    and orders for children to remain at the house untill further orders and when at
                                    last those order[s] came and we were permited, under an escort of the "Old
                                    Folks," to go and see the "raging of the waters" it was
                                    after its bulk was considerably reduced, our ardor considerably cooled, and our
                                    patienc [el considerably worried; and when we returned, it was only as disapointed,
                                    wet, and illhumored progenies. Of [course] there were some few exceptions to this
                                    general rule, all of which exceptions will ever be remembered with pleasure.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday was Sunday. In camp at ten o'clock A.M. there was a general
                                    inspection of quarters, arms, accouterments, etc. At half past 3 in the afternoon,
                                    the Chaplin preached a first-rate sermon, which was listened too attentively by some
                                    two or three hundred of the Reg't. His talk was practical; and if the
                                    soldiers would all take his advice, what a different Reg't. [we] would
                                    have.</p>

                                    the other men are from other companies; and they are generaly so wicked that the
                                    most wicked of our Co. appear good in the comparison. The six men that are with me
                                    this time will take the premium for wickedness over all others with whom I have been

                        <p>Got a long letter from home yesterday morning from Mother, Sudie and Zwingie<hi rend="sup">15</hi> inclusive. It contained any amount of good. The same remarks
                                    will still apply to the weather that have been given it; for the last week or two,
                                    hot is no name for it, unless qualified by some very expressive adjective; and even
                                    that would fail to give an adequate idea of its violence. Experience alone can
                                    convey its burning.</p>
                        <p>My paper gave out yesterday, but I expect a supply from home in a few days as I have
                                    written for the folks to send me some, which no doubt they will do.</p>

                                    to go with some of his comrades. So I took his place on patrol, which is much more
                                    pleasant than picket duty. I don't go on duty now untill 1 o'clock

                                    be in limited quantities.</p>
                        <p>Tuesday, June 28</p>
                        <p>I got a rich treat from home last night, a long letter from Father and Mother and a
                                    package containing an <hi rend="i">Independent</hi> and [a] <hi rend="i">Tribune,</hi> on which I have been feasting myself all day. The supplement to the
                                        <hi rend="i">Independent</hi> contained a rich sermon by the Rev. H. W.
                                        Beecher.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> If the folks would only send me such reading
                                    matter every <hi rend="i">[sic],</hi> it would be a great advantage.</p>
                        <p>I often wish I was a Botanist, for the shrubs and flowers of Coffee Co. as a general
                                    thing are entirely new to me. To be sure, we have the inevitable (speaking in common
                                    parlance) white blossom, &amp; dog fennel are in great abundance here; but the
                                    majority of the wild flowers are unknown to me, both visibly and botanicaly.
                                    Huckleberries, blackberries, dewberries, cherries, etc. are in great abundance in
                                    the vicinity; but we have little chance of gathering them.</p>

                        <p>Wrote a long letter to Father yesterday ceturing him on his supposed <hi rend="i">Fremontism,</hi> containing eight pages.</p>
                        <p>This is realy a pleasant day, at least on picket post No. 1 where I am stationed
                                    today. The weather has greatly moderated since the heavy rain day before yesterday.
                                    I think it must have rained in Indiana for the cloud came from that direction.
                                    Contrabands say all thunder storms here come from the North. This has proved to be
                                    true in what few I have witnessed.</p>

                                        Pennsylvania's hills And the blood of patriots swept along Was redning

                                        the dust. Oh Gettysburgh! can we forget The deed enacted there Nor can we ever

                        <p>All hail the natal day of "The Great Republic." We welcome thee
                                    with joyful hearts and grateful feelings. We cannot cease to praise and admire the
                                    American Congress of 1776 that had the patriotism and moral courage to stand forth
                                    undismayed in the delclaration and sustainment of our <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-051-2-069"/> national independence. Then let "The wild
                                    bells ring out to the wild air." Let the cannons roar and boys shout and
                                    old men smile and soldiers fight all in honor of the great day rendered doubly dear
                                    in these late times by great victories in favor of those sustaining the principle
                                    for which the day is celebrated. The Declaration of Independence, the surrender of
                                    Vicksburgh, and the retreat of Lee from free territory—may they ever be
                                    remembered and commemorated by all good people.</p>
                        <p>But to particulars. I was wakened in the morning by the sound of cannon firing a
                                    national salute. Came off of duty at nine o'clock. Went to Headquarters and
                                    addressed by W. P. Fishback Esq., private 138th Reg't., a Dr. Somebody from

                        <p>During the day a small picnic party had been organized and after the military

                        <p>On repairing to the destined spot we found a "Superbus Quercus"
                                    which spread its magnificent foliage in luxuriant abundance around its trunk,
                                    forming a pleasant shade on a beautiful plot of grass, forming every natural comfort
                                    necessary for the enjoyment of our party. Here we spread our table with
                                    earth's green canopy for a cloth and began immediately to prepare the <hi rend="i">military necessities</hi> that had been collected beforehand.</p>

                        <p>Sunday Morning, July 31</p>
                        <p>This is the last day of July. Tomorrow I suppose our folks will go to the Negro
                                    Celebration. I was there last year, but had no idea I would be in <placeName>

                                    </placeName> a twelve month from then. But such is the fact, and I can't
                                    help of thinking where I will be a year hence. The chances are that if I am not
                                    drafted nor dead I will be in Indiana. But I cannot tell.</p>
                        <p>Tuesday, August 2</p>
                        <p>Yesterday was a very busy day in camp. The Surgeon had recommended a removal of our
                                    tents to the Parade ground for Sanitary purposes, thinking that they had remained in
                                    their former position long enough. Accordingly the movement began about 9
                                    o'clock yesterday morning and is not finished yet. The "Modus
                                    operandi" was for as many to get around a shanty as possible and pick it up
                                    bodily and carry it to its new position. There was some hard lifting to do; but it
                                    is all done now and there is nothing left to do but clean up the new and old
                                    quarters, a task as great as carrying the shanties but not such hard work.</p>
                        <p>I go on duty tomorrow, [the] first time since I have been sick; but I feel
                                    "tantamount" to the undertaking.</p>
                        <p>Wednesday, Aug. 3, 5 P.M. Headquarters Patrol</p>
                        <p>This is the first time I have been on duty since I was sick; and I am glad that I got
                                    on Patrol, for I can get to sleep in the guardhouse while off duty and thereby keep
                                    out of the almost inevitable rain which generaly fall[s] night &amp; day.</p>
                        <p>There was one of the biggest storms today that there has been since we came here. The
                                    wind b[l]ew almost a hurricane and the rain fell in torrents for near[ly] an hour,
                                    completely drenching everything not well sheltered. Several of the tents were blown
                                    over, and most of them got wet inside.</p>
                        <p>I am getting along nicely with my Anatomy. Recite several pages daily to Sergt.

                        <p>Sunday, August 7</p>
                        <p>There has been no big rain yet today, but from indications and precedents there will
                                    be. It has rained every day <pb n="159" id="VAA4025-051-2-073"/> now for a week.
                                    Three of them have been very hard rains. The rest, little showers.</p>
                        <p>Had a peach cobbler for dinner too day. Peaches are becoming plenty but are yet very
                                    costly. The peaches we put in the cobbler costing 75 cts. Potatoes are
                                    $1.50 per busher [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]. Apples are various prices
                                    according to quality.</p>
                        <p>I am on picket today. Post No. 5. First picket duty that I have done for a long time.
                                    So far, it is a nice day, some rainfall this morning but not enough to wet our
                                    clothes.</p>
                        <p>About two more writings will fill up my book, and then I suppose I will quit.</p>
                        <p>Wednesday, Aug. 10</p>
                        <p>I see I am very likely to lose my last writing if great care is not taken as it is
                                    torn by some unaccountable means. I'm at No. 5 again. [This] makes two
                                    times in succession on one post. There has already been one shower today and if
                                    appearances are not deceitful, the shower will be in the plural before morning.</p>
                        <p>I do much of my writing and reading on picket because I have nothing else to do then.
                                    In camp my other duties occupy a considerable portion of my time, but here I can
                                    give my individual attention to literary pursuits.</p>
                        <p>Had apple dumplings for dinner today, excellent in quality but rather poor in
                                    appearance, their apprenticeship in the camp kettele having given them rather a
                                    sable appearance.</p>
                        <p>Another big train of Rebs passed here today. I suppose nearly a thousand.</p>
                        <p>Monday, Aug. 15</p>
                        <p>This is the last writing I will do in this journal. I had thought it would be large
                                    enough to answer all my purposes for the "Hundred Days," but in
                                    this as in many other things in my life I have been mistaken. I can only say with
                                    Byron that "what is writ is writ" and shall neither regret nor
                                    exult over what is written.</p>
                        <p>Our sick are all to be sent home tomorrow as they could not well be sent with the
                                    Reg't.</p>
                        <p>There was quite an alarm here last night caused by someone firing his revolver at
                                    some other one. The long roll was beaten, and the reg't. turned out double
                                    quick.</p>

                        <p>Tullahoma, Tenn. Friday, Sep[t]. 9</p>
                        <p>Who would ever have thought that I would have pined an additional few leaves to my
                                    diary for the purpose of writing in this town at this late period. But by the
                                    kindness of my Phriend Wheeler<hi rend="sup">23</hi> we have been permitted to
                                    remain here till this late date. Wheeler cut our communications. On the 30 Aug., the
                                    day probaly we would have started home had it not been for his unpleasant proximity,
                                    he tore up a good deal of the track between here and Murfreesboro; but the principal
                                    damage he did to the road was between that point and <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. Just how much damage he did do, we do not know here yet as
                                    communication has not been reestablished and there is no telling when it will be.
                                    This Wheeler raid has been considerable of a bore on us, for we are shut off from
                                    all the world except Sherman's army, which by the way we have good news
                                    from.</p>
                        <p>I have not been well for a fortnight past. My stomach out of order some way. Am
                                    better now than I have been.</p>

                        <p>There was great joy in camp yesterday caused by the arrival of the mail from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, the first news we had had from Christendom for a long while. The mail
                                    was hauled down from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to Murfreesboro in wagons and thence here by rail. I got one letter
                                    from Sudie Morgan, written from Pine Prowe, but where that is I don't
                                    pretend to know. I had expected a letter from home by the first mail that come
                                    through, but in this I was disappointed. Today, however, the road is opened through
                                    to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and there has already two trains gone up; and there will be a train
                                    going south at six o'clock this afternoon and very likely there will be
                                    another mail and a letter from home, at least I hope so.</p>
                        <p>I have not written any letters yet since the raid because there has been no chance to
                                    send them out, but I believe the <list type="footnotes">

                        <p>It is just four months today since we went into camp. The Hundred Day service is fast
                                    running into "for three years unless sooner discharged" and the
                                    boys are grumbling about it considerably. They think now that the road is opened and
                                    their time out, they should be sent home; and all the red tape from Gen. Milroy down
                                    to the Lieuts. of the companies receive a full share of blame for our detention. But
                                    Col. Robinson<hi rend="sup">24</hi> gets a double portion of anathemas. It is
                                    reported, with I don't know how much truth, that he offered the services of
                                    the Reg't. for another month. If the boys find out certainly that he did do
                                    [this], they will <hi rend="i">love</hi> him a great deal better than they do now,
                                    which is <hi rend="i">extraordinarily</hi> well.</p>

                                    nights. So inviting indeed are both day &amp; night that it makes one wish

                        <p>We were more fortunate in getting off from War Trace than I anticipated. The reason
                                    we staid so long was because the locomotive got out of water and there were no tanks
                                    close [by]. As soon as the Col. found out what was the matter, he made a detail to
                                    go with the engine to a neighboring spring and fill up the tender. This was

                        <p>Nearly all the guards along the road are Negroes. They are fine looking soldiers.
                                    They always turn out at a present arms when the train passes. Their accouterments
                                    and guns are bright as they can be, and the broad smile that marks their
                                    countenances attest their like of the change from Chattels to U. S. soldiers.</p>

            <p>During the presidential campaign of 1836, a four-page campaign newspaper called the <hi rend="i">Tippecanoe Calumet Warclub,</hi> strongly advocating the election of William Henry Harrison,
                    was published in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>, <region type="county">Clark County</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, by J. D.
                    Nichols. It was edited by the Whig Central Committee, which consisted of William V. H. Cushing,
                    William A. Rogers, and James S. Halsey. The paper came out the last three months of the campaign,
                    "weekly until the Presidential election." Subscriptions in advance were available
                    at fifty cents; it was twenty cents a copy to clubs of five. The number of subscribers was about
                    2,500.</p>
            <p>Four years later, in 1840, the publication of the <hi rend="i">Tippecanoe Calumet &amp;
                    War-Club</hi> was renewed by Jacob and John A. Crain. It, too, was published at <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                    </placeName>." Violently for Harrison and John Tyler, it was edited by the Whig Central
                    Committee as before, with an increased circulation—the number of subscribers amounting to
                    about 4,000. John D. Nichols was the agent. Subscriptions were $1.00, and there were to
                    be twenty-six numbers.</p>

                    material concerning the <hi rend="i">Tippecanoe Calumet Warclub</hi> consisting of letters and
                    papers, principally the latter, dated January 30 to November 25, 1840, including a notebook
                    containing a partial list of subscribers. Most of the items are subscription lists, or concern
                    subscribers. The following letter to John A. Crain at <placeName>

                                    of that association, and he expresses his willingness to aid if possible, the good
                                    cause of the "old Hero", but said that they were indebted largely,
                                    notwithstanding the very liberal donations they had received. That association has
                                    engaged to establish presses throughout the different sections of German population
                                    for the distribution of papers containing the Harrison principles, free of expenses,
                                    besides the printing and distributing, gratis, of twenty thousand English, and ten
                                    thousand German, copies of the life of Harrison, which is attended with a cost of 25
                                    cents a copy. All these, (and they are no more than is required in order to carry
                                    the state), amount to a Herculean labor. All these things, and more being in view,

                                    paper, to represent an an Indian! with a Calumet, and put something more appropriate
                                    in its place. That only excites ridicule—is not un-frequently compared to
                                    a "Green young Whig with his breeches down". Fill your paper with
                                    figures of "log Cabins"—"Hard-Cider"
                                    Barrels. Soldiers, Battles, Indians, Scalping females, and
                                    children—Houses in flames, etc. from the demoniac acts of savage
                                    barbarity. And you will then find that your paper will count, perhaps as much good
                                    as your most sanguine hearts could expect—Be assured that there is
                                    nothing in this world of such ready acceptance as "Humbug;" it is
                                    the order of the day and has more power even among men of strong minds and honest
                                    hearts, than we are willing to admit. Try it John, and you will find your advantage
                                    in it—And if it be not inconsistent with your pledges and other
                                    professions, advocate hard money, and cite the late suspension bill of the Locofoco
                                    legislation of Penna. as a bugbear—all of them are Humbugs of the first
                                    water, and will have their weight, if not of literal truth. The prospect of a War,
                                    too, and the probable destruction of property, and loss of [ms torn] from the

            <head>Editor's Pages</head>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> recently completed its first half-century of
                    continuous publication. An historical sketch of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> during this initial
                    period appeared in the March issue, written by Emeritus Professor William O. Lynch, its editor from
                    1928 until 1941. In the latter year he was succeeded by Dr. John D. Barnhart, who served as editor
                    until May 1, 1955.</p>
            <p>The following paragraphs, taken verbatim from the opening remarks of Dr. Barnhart when he became
                    editor, express basic ideas and concepts which are equally appropriate now:</p>
            <p>"Various questions have been asked about the policies of the new editor. The first policy
                    will be that of learning how to edit the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> as it has been edited.
                    Consequently there will not be any important immediate changes nor any radical departures or
                    thoughtless deviations from the past. When the business at hand is more fully understood there will
                    be time enough to think about changes. The work of the previous editors is definitely appreciated
                    and the first task is to do as well as they have done. That cannot be accomplished, however, without
                    striving at the same time to make the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> better. Undoubtedly each of them
                    strove constantly to make improvements, and therefore, to do as well means to try to do better. It
                    is to be hoped that as time passes evidence of this effort will appear. Suggestions will always be
                    appreciated whether it is possible to adopt them or not. Criticism, whether favorable or
                    unfavorable, will also be welcome."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fortunately the retiring editor has left a number of articles available for publication and also a
                    supply of books for review. This issue was almost ready for the printer on May 1, so that it is
                    largely the result of the efforts of Dr. Barnhart and Miss Kathleen Nolan, his assistant editor.</p>
            <p>As indicated on the cover, Professor Barnhart will become a member of the editorial committee.
                    Professor Lynch will remain on this committee, as will Dr. Albert L. Kohlmeier, former chairman of
                    the department of history and now professor emeritus of history. Mr. Hubert Hawkins, Director of the
                    Indiana Historical Bureau and Secretary of the Indiana Historical Society, will likewise continue,

            <p>The <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> will continue to be devoted to the muse of Clio, but not in any narrow
                    or provincial manner. It will endeavor to increase understanding and appreciation of the past, which
                    is always the father of the present. Much is currently being said and written about the need to
                    understand the world in which we live. The historian can do this more effectively by studying the
                    experiences of men through the centuries, and by reflecting upon what may be called the historical
                    process, than by losing his perspective in a rootless absorption with so-called contemporary
                    history.</p>
            <p>For instance, if one is eager to increase his understanding of the world today, a careful
                    reading—and then rereadings—of the <hi rend="i">History</hi> of Thucydides can
                    help to develop that depth of understanding about "current events" which can be
                    derived only by an awareness of the continuity of human experience. In fact, the wisdom and insights
                    which can be obtained from a faithful devotion to Clio are increasingly important. The editor is
                    eager to keep the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> faithful to the best traditions of the historical craft
                    and he hopes that numerous readers, both old and new, will continue to find the magazine interesting
                    and worthwhile.</p>

                    </placeName>: Macmillan, 1954, pp. vii, 253. Illustrations, bibliography, and index.
                    $7.50)</head>
            <p>For many years Paul Weatherwax, Professor of Botany at Indiana University, has been studying the
                    morphology of corn and its relatives. Ten years ago he published a small booklet on this subject. It
                    was well illustrated with line drawings of unusual clarity and comprehensibility. He spoke surely
                    and effectively from a wealth of firsthand experience and a broad understanding of the techniques at
                    his command. It was well received and demands for a new edition have been made.</p>
            <p>In recent years Weatherwax has broadened his attack. He has read extensively in early historical
                    accounts and has traveled in Central and South America and in the American Southwest to see
                    firsthand some of the wonders of the world of corn. He found a number of items of interest and took
                    some pictures of which he can be justly proud. The present volume is the author's attempt
                    to popularize his earlier work and to include the results of his more recent historical reading and
                    travels.</p>
            <p>The book opens with several chapters devoted to a review of early historical references to the
                    discovery of corn and its reception in Europe. (Africa is ignored and Asia relegated to incidental
                    consideration in a later chapter.) Chapters seven to eleven deal with corn in America at the time of
                    European discovery and early settlement. This anecdotal account is interesting reading and gives a
                    good general impression of the corn agriculture of "the" Indian. One would have
                    appreciated a botanical evaluation of some of the summary analyses which occur in the
                    anthropological literature.</p>
            <p>Chapters twelve through seventeen constitute a relatively popular review of the botanical theories
                    about the origin and development of cultivated corn. The problem is a difficult one. The plant has
                    been highly distorted under cultivation. The degree and direction of that distortion is a matter of
                    debate. There are few, if any, close wild relatives. Written history is much too late to be of much
                    significance. Archaeology has recently yielded materials of significant age but they are
                    geographically marginal. In spite of the publication of a considerable volume of theory and the
                    appearance of some <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-051-2-084"/> new critical material, the author adds
                    little to the basic criticism in his former work, possibly because there is very little to add.</p>
            <p>It is startling to find that after fifty years of active speculation about the origin of corn there
                    is little real data, and, in the opinion of the present writer at least, no even remotely reliable
                    conclusions. It is appalling, however, to find the current literature still clogged with (a) a
                    theory which was negated soon after its publication in 1896, (b) a theory obviously misapplied by
                    its originator and still of uncertain application, (c) a phantasmagoria of speculation
                    "topheavy with assumptions of such character that if any one of them should be rejected the
                    whole structure would fall" (p. 174), (d) a child's pottery rattle.</p>
            <p>It is apparent that many of these "scientific conclusions" have been presented in
                    response to a social pressure to conform to the prevailing anthropological theories, which were in
                    turn influenced by a desire to conform to the prevailing botanical theories. Highly imaginative
                    theories have survived, not just because they have been called "scientific," but
                    because, gentle readers, we have found it convenient to believe them. Weatherwax has presented his
                    own seemingly sane analysis of the current data, and has marked it, clearly, an alternative theory.</p>
            <p>In the concluding chapter the author returns to the anecdotal theme, with a discussion of corn in
                    Indian art, mythology, and religion.</p>
            <p>The discussions are handsomely and appropriately illustrated with photographs, reproductions of early
                    herbal plates, and all too few line drawings. There are seven pages of bibliography and an index.</p>
            <p>The result is a beautiful book with many revealing insights and critical observations about the
                    history of corn, its spread to Europe, and its use by early American Indians.</p>

            <p>There is little new which can be said about a series now in its eleventh of twelve planned volumes
                    plus one of addenda <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-051-2-085"/> and a cumulative index. But it is a
                    pleasure to join in the chorus of praise for a work of historical craftsmanship so thorough and so
                    useful. Had the title been less prosaic, say "The Life and Times of Sir William Johnson:
                    The Triumph of the First British Empire in America," many would obtain a better idea of its
                    true importance.</p>
            <p>The theme of this volume is the years 1764 and 1765, when English self-satisfaction at the recent
                    victory over <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> had been rudely shattered by the astounding success of Pontiac's rebellion.
                    Sir William Johnson more than any other man was the architect of the rebuilding process which
                    necessarily followed. The range of his correspondence shows how well fitted for the task he was;
                    full and regular reports came to him from such military men as Thomas Gage, Henry Bouquet, Henry
                    Montour, and Henry Gladwin, from provincial governors like Cadwallader Colden, John Penn, and
                    Francis Fauquier, from members of his own administrative organization like John Stuart and George
                    Croghan, from fur traders and land speculators, and, of course, from the Indians whose great friend
                    he was. In an age when most Americans viewed the rights of man as synonymous with privileged status
                    for the local community, Johnson possessed a truly national outlook.</p>
            <p>As 1764 opened, the overshadowing concern was to pacify the Indians, recover white prisoners, and
                    punish those responsible for the outbreak to the limited extent possible. First, Sir William drove
                    the Iroquois cork even more firmly into the bottle of the still-smoldering Indian conspiracy. Then,
                    despite such major hindrances as the murderous activities of the Paxton Boys, sabotage by land
                    speculator-dominated colonial assemblies and the unpredictable behavior of military unit commanders,
                    he proceeded methodically and with true artistry to utilize Indian diplomatic techniques in quieting
                    successively the Senecas, the Miami-Shawnee-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> group, the Illinois Indians, and the far western fringe clear to <placeName>
                        <country reg="mnu">Minnesota</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Johnson possessed a keen insight into the major ingredients of his explosive western mixture, which
                    he reduced to the friction of three elements—the Indians, the land-hungry American
                    whites, and the French fur traders. He had much sympathy with each group. Certainly the Americans
                    should get the land, but slowly and peaceably. Toward <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-051-2-086"/> the
                    Indians he extended a humanity which smacks of twentieth-century anthropology. Even while charging
                    the French traders, correctly, with being the source of the dangerous rumors which had already
                    sparked one explosion, he saw that they were behaving normally enough for persons in a desperately
                    exposed position tortured by very real fears for their "job security." To each,
                    Johnson would give a measure of satisfaction in order that lasting peace might prevail. As a power
                    in the Indian world, he held a position never again to be equalled by a white man. Sir William
                    served as a court of appeal for Indians everywhere, from his own Six Nations and their wide-ranging
                    Algonkin foes to the pitiful remnant of Mohicans and Narragansetts almost submerged in the rising
                    tide of Yankee population. All of them trusted his integrity even when they doubted his ability to
                    deliver what was asked of him.</p>
            <p>In his attitude toward "Pondiac," Johnson's willingness to forgive a
                    wartime enemy seems more British than American. He agreed with Gage that Pontiac either should be
                    won over, or "knocked in the head" (p. 250). When the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ottawa</settlement>
                    </placeName> chieftain showed a disposition to repent having listened to the French, Johnson was
                    willing to meet him halfway. By 1765, Alexander Fraser was describing Pontiac as "the most
                    sensible man among all the Nations, and the most humane Indian I ever saw" (p. 743). Yet
                    Sir William was always less Indian than white. When Governor Penn asked his advice about offering a
                    bounty for Indian scalps in reprisal for certain frontier killings, Johnson answered with a very
                    positive affirmative (pp. 224, 241). Always he made excellent use of his redskin levies to cut the
                    need for expanding the blood and monies of his own people. And keeping the young braves from
                    white-hunting was no easy job!</p>
            <p>In March of 1765, and roughly two-thirds through this volume, the Stamp Act crisis of the eastern
                    seaboard obtrudes into western affairs, with Colden writing Johnson about the "Insolence of
                    persons in this Province [who] bawl out for Liberty [but] would cut a throat in the dark if they
                    thought they could not be detected." (p. 620). Sir William's reaction was not
                    difficult to predict. His long experience with the endless clashes between Indians and eastern land
                    grabbers, whether big or small, had led him to regard the one as no whit more cruel or faithless
                    than the <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-051-2-087"/> other. His soldier friends regarded Provincials as
                    "but a poor Security" (p. 231). That he would stand with the Imperial Government
                    on Stamp Act issues he makes quite clear in a letter of July 12, 1765, written to Gage (pp.
                    930-932). All good men should come to the aid of their nation, not of their locality.</p>
            <p>Who was the greater danger, the Indian or the frontiersman, to peace in the West is hard to say. But
                    it is easy enough to see why the British government inclined to the Indian side. For it was
                    abundantly evident at all times that Americans had not the slightest agreement with
                    Johnson's position that Indian and white were equals under the law, that a white murderer
                    of a redskin should be hanged just as readily as an Indian who killed a white (p. 791). Both Johnson
                    and his capable agent, George Croghan, were thoroughly fed up with this situation by June, 1765.</p>
            <p>To conclude on a less somber note, one observes with a certain bitter pleasure that apparently rather
                    more whites, proportionately, deserted to the Indians during the eighteenth century than have
                    renegaded to the assorted communist "tribes" of today. Nor are the Johnson Papers
                    without a touch of humor here and there. For a good chuckle, Croghan's letter of fatherly
                    advice to young John Johnson on departing for the fleshpots of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> can be highly recommended (pp. 964-965). Another example: Rum was John-son's
                    "milk" to the Indians, and with the embarrassing directness characteristic of
                    children everywhere they asked him why it should be good for the white man but bad for them.
                    Needless to say, no reply was forthcoming.</p>

            <p>Hubert H. Hawkins, Director of the Indiana Historical Bureau, in the opening sentence of the preface
                    of the book under review, aptly states: "The present volume of messages and papers relating
                    to the administration of Governor James Brown Ray continues the project begun in 1922 of publishing
                    the messages and letters of Indiana's governors." He then <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-051-2-088"/> explains that: "The usefulness of these volumes to students of
                    Indiana history led to the decision to continue the series."</p>
            <p>The papers concerning the Ray administration have been edited by Dorothy Riker and Gayle Thornbrough,
                    experienced editors on the staff of the Bureau. In addition to Ray's messages and
                    correspondence, the volume includes some papers of other state officials, newspaper material, and
                    some contemporary correspondence. Moreover, "a sufficient sampling" has been made
                    of "files of election returns, recommendations, appointments, and resignations, and of
                    pardons and remission of fines, preserved in the State Library to show the different types of
                    problems with which the Governor was faced and the decisions he made." Unfortunately,
                    though manuscript collections in the Indiana State Library and elsewhere were checked, these efforts
                    were not very fruitful. The inability to unearth manuscript materials makes this volume much less
                    useful than it would have been if primary sources of this type had been available.</p>
            <p>The papers are arranged chronologically and the editors have added an extensive index and numerous
                    footnotes. The annotations accompanying the footnotes, however, are at times longer than necessary.
                    A sketch of Ray's career, written by Miss Thornbrough, is included. The laborious editorial
                    duties seem to have been done with much patience and with persistent efforts to insure the accurate
                    reproduction of the documents used.</p>
            <p>Though it is a cliché to say that so-and-so was a remarkable or unusual individual, this
                    was certainly true of Governor Ray. A native of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, he studied law in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> before he came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1818, where he was admitted to the bar in that same year. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, at the junction of the forks of the Whitewater, was then one of the leading towns of
                    the new state and about this time it included several citizens who later became important political
                    leaders in Indiana. In 1821 Ray was elected to the lower house of the state legislature and then to
                    the upper house or senate one year later. When Governor William Hendricks was elected to the United
                    States Senate, early in 1825, Ray became governor by virtue of his position as president pro-tem of
                    the senate. A contest ensued over whether he was entitled to the office, but he retained the
                    gubernatorial chair for the remainder of his predecessor's term. In the election of 1825 he
                    won a majority <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-051-2-089"/> of the popular votes for the governorship, while
                    three years later he won re-election but with only a plurality of the votes cast in a race in which
                    he had two major rivals. After his tenure as chief executive Ray unsuccessfully sought several other
                    public positions, including representative in Congress. He followed a variety of legal and business
                    interests until his death from cholera in 1848, but his political influence had waned even before he
                    left the office of governor, perhaps even before the end of his initial elective term. While
                    governor he urged the building of a network of railroads across Indiana, preferring them to canals
                    despite the fact that no track had yet been laid in Indiana.</p>
            <p>Many aspects of pioneer government and life are described in this volume, some at great length. Much
                    space is devoted to Indian affairs, public lands, campaigns and elections, appointments and
                    patronage, fiscal problems, internal improvements (transportation), the tariff, executive pardons
                    and the remission of fines, the status of the militia, and the general political situation in the
                    years in which rival political parties were in process of being established in Indiana. On the other
                    hand, such topics as mental health, education, social welfare, state parks, conservation, labor
                    legislation, and the regulation of business and industry were then either virtually unknown or else
                    principally the concern of county and local units of government.</p>
            <p>This volume is particularly helpful in exhibiting the contrast between pioneer Indiana in its heyday
                    and the modern industrial commonwealth of the mid-twentieth century. Recent governors and
                    legislators might be very much surprised to learn that late in 1827, Ray wrote to the members of the
                    General Assembly that he had not yet appointed a private secretary because: "Since I have
                    been in office, I have, done all the business required of the Executive of Indiana, in person; and
                    expect in future to pursue that course." (p. 315) (About one year later, however, following
                    his reelection for a second term, he informed the assembly of the name of the individual authorized
                    to deliver messages for him as his private secretary.)</p>
            <p>In 1830 Indiana's total population was only 343,031, with not a single town large enough to
                    make the urban category of 2,500 or more inhabitants. The rural, agrarian society which Governor Ray
                    served was entirely without railroads and improved highways; it had no daily newspapers; it had <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-051-2-090"/> no real banks, with perhaps one exception; the factory system
                    was in the future; the telegraph had not yet been invented; the prison at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the only state charitable or correctional institution; agricultural methods were
                    more like those of ancient times than the practices of the 1950's; and the northern half of
                    the state was largely unsettled, partly because many of the Miami and Potawatomi Indians still
                    occupied much of this area. Even more suggestive of the situation at that time is the report of the
                    state treasurer for 1829-1830 which estimates state expenditures as aggregating about
                    $34,000 for that year, leaving a balance in the public treasury of just over
                    $2,000!</p>
            <p>This series should definitely be continued, although items included in the <hi rend="i">Documentary
                        Journal,</hi> which commenced with the legislative session of 1835-1836 and continued through
                    that for 1909, should generally be excluded. Moreover, a high priority should be given to the search
                    for and publication of correspondence to and from the governor. Whatever the pros and cons of
                    keeping certain governmental records secret or inaccessible from contemporaries—though
                    even here the public interest is often sacrificed by too much secrecy—the failure to
                    preserve and publish basic information about essential public functions unfortunately merely adds to
                    the "blackout" of significant and relevant information and to that extent results
                    in a less well informed and therefore a less capable citizenry. Furthermore, public officers should
                    always be aware that public office is a public trust and that they are responsible to both current
                    and succeeding generations. With Indiana's sesquicentennial of statehood only about a
                    decade away, the period between now and then should be one in which Hoosiers give greater support,
                    both private and public, to significant efforts for preserving and publishing important source
                    materials concerning all phases of Indiana's history.</p>

            <p>Those of us who have known of Robert Price's protracted labor on this book may regard the
                    final achievement with the <pb n="177" id="VAA4025-051-2-091"/> greatest sense of reward. If he
                    seems proprietary of the uniqueness of his research and of Johnny Appleseed himself, he has the
                    justification of long and scholarly association. For as he states in his foreword, the work took him
                    nearly a quarter century (twenty-three years, to be exact) from the time he set out to give
                    "the few facts and the multitudinous fancies a critical sifting." Possibly there
                    are biographers who might not regard John Chapman of sufficient importance for such an expenditure
                    of time and labor. But a writer's freedom to choose a congenial subject and to pursue it
                    with faith and tenacity is his unquestioned privilege. In this case the results as set forth so ably
                    by Robert Price will prove of great interest and value to the regional historian, to the devotee of
                    Americana, to the folklorist, and to those whom the author lumps together as the "swarms of
                    [Johnny Apple-seed] enthusiasts." (The last breed may not be as multi-tudinous as he
                    believes, but certainly their number is gratifyingly large, including both the informed and the
                    uninformed.) For his final research Price was given a year's grant-in-aid by the Library of
                    Congress.</p>
            <p>Price does not greatly overstate his claim in declaring that he tells "Johnny
                    Appleseed's real story for the first time." He means that he is the first to
                    present to adult readers the sum total of true facts available and an exhaustive interpretation of
                    both man and myth from the purely scholastic standpoint. Toward this end he tracked down every
                    possible source. He made innumerable journeys, charting the itinerant nurseryman's
                    probable, actual, and traditional locations and movements. (It is a pleasure to read the
                    author's graceful descriptions of "the Johnny Appleseed country.")
                    Through the years he delved into courthouse and statehouse records. He found and selected
                    illustrative items which give emphasis and add interest to the finished book. He scanned every
                    existing scrap of related poetry, every line of related prose, including documents, letters, and
                    newspapers. With analytical scrutiny he perused the county histories. He describes them as
                    "none too accurate," a fact well known to others. These volumes abound in colorful
                    pioneer yarns and hand-me-down family reminiscences about Johnny Appleseed. The task of deciding
                    which may be retained as basically true or rejected as invention is a difficult one. It is doubtful
                    if the most meticulous and logical-minded investigator could come <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-051-2-092"/> up with an infallible conclusion every time. But because of the integrity of Price's
                    scholarship and his "critical sifting," his decisions are bound to be as nearly
                    correct as may ever be reached. They are not likely to be challenged.</p>
            <p>Price has accomplished the work of organization and presentation of his material with unusual skill
                    and clarity and with a fine sense of balance. His attitude toward it is cool and judicial, his style
                    urbane and leisurely, with graceful harmonic overtones. The book is divided into five parts,
                    picturesquely titled. These depict John Chapman in his various roles and interpret his character as
                    man and myth. There is the young Yankee pioneering westward to make his first entry into
                    north-central <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> as an itinerant nurseryman. There is Chapman the tough border hero. In the latter
                    presentation, Price relates many yarns as spun by Chapman's contemporaries, and declares
                    "they were inspired by the fact that [the man] most certainly was a participant in the
                    Indian troubles" [<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>]. In introducing Chapman as a land-seeker, leasing or buying with remarkably shrewd
                    foresight, the author gives documentary proof. (Copious appendices and notes, plus a list of the
                    planter's land-holdings, help to substantiate and enlarge the text.) Price writes that by
                    the time Chapman was forty he held "640 acres of tiptop land under lifetime leases, and
                    owned outright two town lots in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mount Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName>." Expanding in a much later chapter on the nursery-man's growing
                    business transactions, the author states that they gave him an affluence considerably better than
                    that of the average settler. Discerningly, Price concludes that Chap-man's reticence
                    regarding his business affairs and his silent acquiescence to the settlers' opinion of him
                    as a penniless eccentric was, "considering the sums he transported from time to time
                    [along] lonely ways," a matter of Yankee caution. Moreover, "the dusty records of
                    John Chapman's real estate" prove that "the man behind the [folk]
                    idealization was anything but a feeble-minded vagrant or impractical fanatic." Further
                    proof of a different kind of intelligence is contained in an illuminating section on Chapman as a
                    Swedenborgian missionary. That he was a dispenser of New Church doctrines is well known. But for the
                    first time this phase of "the man's inner life" is offered the lay reader
                    by means of extractions from the letter book of a prominent Eastern Swedenborgian of the time. The
                    letters are not only written in respectful fellowship to Chapman himself, but to <pb n="179" id="VAA4025-051-2-093"/> others of the faith regarding his labors, particularly his surprising
                    offer to exchange some of his land for Church literature.</p>
            <p>Price continues to follow Chapman into new ranges, even to setting down chronologically (from
                    documentary date entries) his movements from 1830 to 1838, when Indiana became his home base. But
                    when he died in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a considerable owner of property, the extent of which even his kin and appointed
                    administrators never fully learned, he was little known in the region.</p>
            <p>Midway of this narrative of true events, Price begins to explain how the legend took root and grew.
                    (He calls the nickname—<hi rend="i">Johnny
                    Appleseed</hi>—"grotesque," an adjective most readers will protest.) A
                    host of pioneer tales which fostered the various facets of the legend are recounted, drawn chiefly
                    from the county histories. While there have been "episodic accretions" from other
                    sources, these histories are the fountainhead from which has sprung most of the portraitures of the
                    folk hero, particularly abundant in the field of literary production. Price seems to be moderately
                    tolerant of these, and specifically mentions a few he considers worthy. He has provided a
                    bibliography, also. But he deplores exaggerations of the myth which have sent it flying wildly off
                    its valid base, and he scorns the weakening effect of much sentimental prettying-up. "No
                    apple-blossoms, please," he begs for himself on the jacket flap. It is therefore rather
                    cheering to note his momentary departure from this firm stand, when he reports a weather entry in a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> diary a few days after John Chapman's death. <hi rend="i">"In the
                        night thunder showers—then fair—first apple blossom."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Undoubtedly it was the myth which first attracted Price. But while he gives it just and proportionate
                    space, he is much more interested in presenting the man. This is both understandable and fortunate.
                    Johnny Appleseed is already far better known to Americans than John Chapman. Price wished to elevate
                    him to his true stature as a real person. It was his primary purpose, therefore, to disengage man
                    from myth, as nearly as such cleavage can be effected. He believes that the legend is still
                    vigorously expanding. In reference to this conviction, and to those Americans who claim Johnny
                    Apple-seed and his orchards far beyond truth and reason, Price terminates his book on a slightly
                    sardonic note—"He will be <pb n="180" id="VAA4025-051-2-094"/> out your way
                    soon." However, in view of the nature of the present times, and because print on the Johnny
                    Appleseed theme is already of considerable extent, one might venture to opine that the myth may have
                    reached the limit of its stretch except, perhaps, via television. Even then Johnny will appear in
                    Disneyesque garb: as the traditional fixation rather than the new true story: as myth rather than as
                    man. Thus do Americans prefer him. They will continue to be unsparingly sentimental about him, or to
                    cherish a purer sentiment, according to their individual natures. Indeed, Johnny Appleseed is more
                    important in our American culture as myth. Throughout his book, Price is aware of its preponderance
                    and its enduring vitality, and after all his laborious work, yields to it with understanding and
                    humor.</p>
            <p>Those who miss this fine, richly detailed book will be the losers. Those future would-be biographers
                    of John Chapman shall better relinquish their aspirations. For Robert Price's book will
                    remain the definitive factual and interpretative work on the subject.</p>

            <p>Capture by Indians was one of the many hazards which faced the pioneers from coast to coast. The
                    tales of the survivors were told and retold, printed and reprinted during the eighteenth and
                    nineteenth centuries, and this book by Howard H. Peckham proves that interest in them has not
                    disappeared altogether in the twentieth. Peckham has retold fourteen such narratives, with added
                    historical background and contemporary illustrations, in a style more concise and readable than that
                    of the originals; he has selected the accounts for their drama, entertainment value, and
                    reliability, with some attention to chronology and geography. Thus, while they illustrate the range
                    of occurrence in both time and space, they are not intended to be a cross section of captivity
                    experiences but rather an introduction to this type of historical literature.</p>

                    intended purpose—an introduction to the captivities—and might appeal
                    especially to high school students and to undergraduates, as well as to the general reader.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Self-Made Man in America.</hi> By Irvin G. Wyllie. (<placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nkc">New Brunswick</region>, <region type="state" reg="nju">New
                        Jersey</region>

                    on sources, and index. $4.00.)</head>
            <p>For some time now many of us have known that the American saga of the self-made man was a myth rather
                    than an undisputed "fact." Often repeated by many different groups, the
                    "rags to riches" theme became, and long remained, a part of our folk literature.
                    For anyone to question it was heresy, if not downright unpatriotic. Irvin G. Wyllie has attempted to
                    uncover the origins of the myth, to analyze it, and to learn by whom it was most used, for what
                    purposes, and with what effect in relation to its legendary hero, the <pb n="182" id="VAA4025-051-2-096"/> American businessman. To a very large extent, he has succeeded in
                    accomplishing this task. Wyllie has written an interesting, balanced, and lucid account of a very
                    important idea in American history. It should be pointed out at once, however, that this is not a
                    study of the occupational origins and environmental conditions of American businessmen, nor is it an
                    attempt to ascertain from what social classes business leaders have been recruited.
                    Wyllie's concern is "not with business history but intellectual history, and
                    specifically with the realm of ideas about self-help under American conditions of
                    opportunity." In no sense, therefore, is this a study of the business elite, though it
                    profits from and contributes to such works. The setting here is much broader, the analysis of the
                    idea and its advocates clearly set forth for the first time, and its relationship to the main
                    currents of American thought carefully delineated. If for no other reason then, this book should
                    appeal to and be read by business and economic historians as well as those primarily interested in
                    the history of ideas.</p>
            <p>The foundation upon which the myth was to blossom and flourish in the post-Civil War years was laid
                    down by clergymen, educators, journalists, and others in the 1830's, when the consequences
                    of industrialism first became apparent. The concept of America as the land of limitless opportunity
                    where fame and fortune awaited all men who feared God and worked hard was especially popular in the
                    latter part of the nineteenth century, though the term "self-made man" was,
                    according to Wyllie, "first applied" by Henry Clay to a group of manufacturers in
                    1832, "while defending the protective tariff…" From that time on, a
                    persistent propaganda campaign caused the idea to gain a tenacious hold on the popular mind and to
                    permeate every facet of American life. After the Civil War, the titans of industry became the chief
                    objects of praise and the ones which ambitious young men were told to emulate.</p>
            <p>One of the most suggestive parts of Wyllie's study is his analysis of the sources of
                    self-help ideas. The Bible was and remained the primary source, even after the 1880's when
                    Darwinism started to gain respectability in scientific circles. The self-help advocates attributed
                    business success primarily, if not exclusively, to good character, moral rectitude, and such <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-051-2-097"/> cultivated traits as frugality, thrift, and industry. Such
                    important environmental economic factors as abundant and un-excelled natural resources and an
                    expanding national market were always relegated to secondary, if not tertiary positions. Only such
                    external forces as being born in the country of poor parents and hard work during the tender years
                    were admitted by the success advocates. Business failure was also explained in terms of the
                    individual rather than economic circumstances. Lack of good character, inexperience, extravagance,
                    and other similar personal shortcomings were the explanations most used. Failure could never result
                    from lack of intelligence, for the cultists were firm in their conviction that no remarkable
                    intelligence or training was required for business success. After 1900, when men like Carnegie
                    maintained that education had a purposeful value in business, the self-aid groups began to reverse
                    their former position and started to advocate training and education for business. To meet the
                    problems of a new day, other success ideas underwent changes too, but neither the Great Depression
                    nor the publications of business and economic historians refuting the self-help idea succeed in
                    discrediting it. The doggerels were changed, but the success propagandists continued to adhere to
                    the idea that good character was the <hi rend="i">sine qua non</hi> of business success. By
                    analyzing and explaining the "rags to riches" myth, Wyllie makes it possible to
                    appraise the role of the idea in American thought and to evaluate its influence in terms of business
                    leadership.</p>

            <p>In 1949, the American Association for State and Local History sponsored the publication of a
                    paper-backed quarterly called <hi rend="i">American Heritage,</hi> which was well received by the
                    reading public. While this project was underway, another organization, the Society of American
                    Historians, Inc., obtained pledges totaling a considerable sum of money from some influential
                    Americans for the purpose of exploring the <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-051-2-098"/> possibility of a
                    magazine of history in book form. Realizing their common objective, these two groups now have pooled
                    their resources in joint sponsorship of a periodical in book form. The result is a magazine of
                    history which is handsomely bound between hard covers and which is to be published six times a year.</p>
            <p>Many American historians have long recognized the need for some medium whereby history can be made
                    more appealing to a greater number of people. Unfortunately the appeal of the many excellent
                    scholarly articles which appear in the publications of the various historical societies is limited
                    for the most part to the professional historian. Perhaps it is the highly specialized nature of the
                    subject matter of these articles or it is the formidable array of footnotes which characterize the
                    typical professional offering that has made these publications unattractive to the average lay
                    reader. Maybe it is because the historical journals are for one reason or another inaccessible to
                    the general public. Whatever the reason or reasons, the fact remains that comparatively few people
                    read them.</p>
            <p>If the first two numbers of this projected periodical are indicative of the caliber of articles to
                    appear in subsequent numbers, <hi rend="i">American Heritage</hi> stands out as a welcome innovation
                    in historical literature. Excellent writing combined with appropriate illustrations, photographs,
                    and prints make for pleasant, enjoyable reading. As added attractions to the historically minded
                    readers there are several pages of current book reviews, plus a couple of pages of notes bearing the
                    caption "News of History." In short, <hi rend="i">American Heritage</hi> promises
                    to bridge the gap between the offerings of the ultra-pure historians and the superficial works of
                    popular writers.</p>
