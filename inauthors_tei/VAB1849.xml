				<head rend="center">INTRODUCTION.</head>
				<p>AT a reunion of Union soldiers at Auburn, Indiana, in September, 1879, a number of the
					members of the Forty-fourth Indiana Volunteer Infantry met in the public square and formed
					a preliminary organization for the promotion of future reunions of the Regiment. A motion
					offered by Lieutenant Nicholas Ensley was unanimously adopted, requesting the undersigned
					to prepare a history of the Regiment. It was in obedience to that request that this book
					was undertaken.</p>
				<p>It is now more than eighteen years since the organization of this Regiment, and fourteen
					years since the day of its muster out at the expiration of the Rebellion. Although the
					writer was with the Regiment during every day of its service except when absent a few
					weeks on sick furlough, he finds that time has dimmed in his memory many incidents of a
					personal character, that might be of interest. He has had, therefore, to depend mainly
					upon his letters written during the war, the official records, and the correspondence of
					soldiers published at the time, for the material of the following pages.</p>
				<p>The Forty-fourth Regiment of Indiana volunteers was but one of tens of thousands, and but
					one among the one hundred and sixty-two regiments organized <pb id="VAB1849-015" n="6"/>
					in the State of Indiana, for the immortal work of suppressing the gigantic and iniquitous
					rebellion of 1861; yet whatever it accomplished, though no greater than that performed by
					many others, is worthy of permanent record, and remembrance by the government served and
					saved. Especially should the posterity of every soldier of that command take patriotic
					pride in possessing historic and written proof that in their veins flows the blood of
					ancestors who voluntarily left their homes and loved ones, and upon the most terrible and
					bloody battle-fields the world has ever witnessed, fought to preserve for them the
					American Union and the freedom of man. If this little book should have the effect of
					fostering such pride, and preserving the names and memory of the brave and patriotic men
					of this command, it will, I feel assured, accomplish the purpose for which it was
					requested. Shelley sang the spirit of this work:</p>
				<q rend="blockquote">
					<lg rend="center">
						<l>"I will teach thine infant tongue</l>
						<l>To call upon those heroes old</l>
						<l>In their own language, and will mould</l>
						<l>Thy growing spirit in the flame</l>
						<l>Of Grecian lore; that by each name</l>
						<l>A patriot's birth-right thou mayst claim."</l>

					</head>

					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> first gun fired by the Rebellion against Fort Sumter awoke
						Northern Indiana, as it did the whole North. Before that day the subjects of this record
						and their friends knew not war, nor the spirit of war. With the exception of a few men
						scattered here and there, none had seen military service. Thousands of the middle-aged,
						and those entering upon manhood, had never seen a soldier in line or in uniform. The
						terrible struggle in the heart of the peace-loving citizen, between love of home, wife,
						children, and dear friends, and that patriotism aroused by insult to the national flag,
						was a new and painful experience. But a new day had dawned for the people and the
						country. Every man, and woman, and the children of discerning age, commenced to live a
						new life in thought, feeling and action. The hearts of mothers and wives sank in
						anguish, and then rebounded with patriotism, and sons, husbands and fathers sallied from
						every hamlet and neighborhood, voluntarily, and offered their services to the imperiled
						Union. Regiment after regiment was organized at Indianapolis and one or two other places
						in the State. But these places of rendezvous becoming insufficient, Gov. Morton, in
						August, 1861, ordered a camp for volunteers at Fort Wayne for the organization <pb
							id="VAB1849-018" n="8"/> of the Thirtieth Regiment, placing Hugh B. Reed, of Fort
						Wayne, in command of the camp. Before this Regiment was complete, it becoming evident
						that more men would be needed, the organization of the Forty-fourth Regiment was ordered
						by the Governor, and the following commissions were issued for the purpose, on September
						12th, 1861: Lieutenant-Colonel, Baldwin J. Crosthwait, of Angola; Major, Sanford J.
						Stoughton, of Ligonier; Assistant Surgeon, John H. Rerick, of Lagrange. Hugh B. Reed was
						to remain in charge of the camp. The organization of the Regiment was now actively
						commenced, and on October 2d, when the Thirtieth Regiment left camp for the field, the
						Forty-fourth took possession, with ranks nearly half filled. Before this, however, the
						following additional field and staff officers had been commissioned: Colonel, Hugh B.
						Reed, the commander of the camp, September 27th; Adjutant, Charles Case, Fort Wayne,
						September 28th; Quartermaster, George McConnell, Angola, September 28th. The skeletons
						of all the companies were in camp early in October, but the filling up of the ranks was
						not finished until in November. An account of the organization of the several companies
						will be found in connection with the company records. The companies were recruited by
						patriotic citizens in different localities, who felt it their duty to assist in
						suppressing the rebellion. These would prepare an enlistment agreement, circulate it
						among their neighbors for signatures --sometimes canvassing their respective
						counties--call public meetings, make patriotic speeches, awakening the people to an
						appreciation of the perils of the Government. <pb id="VAB1849-019" n="9"/> When a
						sufficient number of volunteers had been secured for the nucleus of a company, they were
						called together at some convenient point in their county, and an election would then be
						held for company officers. Those so chosen were, we believe, in all cases, commissioned
						by the Governor. But there was no delay for commissions. The officers selected at once
						marched their men into camp, and when the ranks were not entirely full, some one or more
						would obtain leave of absence, to return home and continue the recruiting.</p>
					<p>Memory recalls little of interest in camp during the two months the Regiment was
						recruiting and organizing, though then to soldiers and people almost every day seemed
						fraught with vital interest. The men in camp were generally healthy. A few cases of
						measles occurred in October, which infected the command, and afterward disabled many of
						the men temporarily, and caused the death of a number. Dr. B. S. Woodworth, an honored
						physician of Fort Wayne, had medical charge of the camp during the organization of the
						two regiments, the Thirtieth and Forty-fourth, though during the organization of the
						latter the Assistant Surgeon of the Regiment had immediate charge of the camp hospital,
						entering upon duty the first day the Regiment went into camp. The citizens of the city
						took an active interest in providing for the wants of the sick, and when any one became
						seriously ill, provision would be made for him in town, and kind and generous assistance
						rendered.</p>
					<p>A little incident occurred at this time, which had an important bearing upon the
						discipline of the camp. <pb id="VAB1849-020" n="10"/> Among soldiers, the first
						illustration of the metal of their commander, settles many points connected with
						discipline and respect. A volunteer, while in the city, one day, got intoxicated, and
						wandering in front of Col. Reed's residence, attracted his attention. The Colonel came
						out and ordered him to go at once to camp. The would-be soldier replied in an insolent
						manner and started towards the Colonel with the evident intention of assaulting him. As
						soon as he came within arm's length, he met a blow from the fist of the Colonel that
						felled him to the earth, where he remained unconscious a little while. The Colonel
						ordered out his carriage, and calling Dr. Woodworth, who was near at hand, put the man
						in his charge and sent him to camp hospital. He was not seriously hurt. Not having,
						though, as yet been mustered into the service, he was promptly discharged and sent home,
						and so missed service in the Forty-fourth Regiment. A healthy conclusion was at once
						formed in the minds of the volunteers, that they had a commander whom it would be well
						to respect.</p>
					<p>On November 22d, 1861, the Regiment was mustered into the United States service by Lt.
						H. E. Stansbury, U. S. A. The medical examinations were made by Dr. B. S. Woodworth and
						the assistant surgeon of the Regiment. The appearance of the volunteers, and
						satisfactory answers to a few general questions, were all that were required at the
						time, and almost all that the burning patriotism of the people would patiently hear
						to.</p>
					<p>It was thought then that every man who wanted to defend his country, should have the
						privilege. Several men with black hair and beards, and apparently within <pb
							id="VAB1849-021" n="11"/> the military limit as to age on the day of muster, became
						quite gray in a short time after, and before they had had an opportunity to be
						frightened. The young men were not behind the old men in their efforts to get into the
						service, and a number who had not attained the legal age made a good show of years at
						the muster in. The service, though, lost little, if anything, through the latter. Among
						them were afterwards found some of the most enduring and efficient soldiers.</p>
					<p>The organization was completed by the appointment of William W. Martin, of Rome City,
						Surgeon, November 25th, and Rev. G. W. Beeks, of Fort Wayne, Chaplain, November
						26th.</p>
					<p>The Regiment in line, on dress parade, was much praised by the throngs that visited it
						on these occasions, and subsequently, as it marched through the city to the field, for
						the intelligent and splendid physical appearance of its men. Measured by the social
						standard, all grades of society were represented, as well as nearly all vocations; but
						the great mass of the Regiment were young men from the farm and shop, and all, with few
						exceptions, were in possession of a good common school education, whilst numbers had
						passed through high school grades, and some had "been to college." The officers chosen
						by the men in line were from their associates at home, and when these donned their
						shoulder straps, they felt and recognized the fact that in the ranks were left many men
						just as intelligent, brave and worthy as they. Nearly all were worthy of official rank,
						and none too good to be privates; but as <pb id="VAB1849-022" n="12"/> all could not
						serve in either position, distinctions had to be made.</p>
					<p>The field and staff officers, chosen by the Governor of the State, were also from
						comrades of the men in line in civil life, though more largely representative of the
						professions.</p>

					</head>

					<p>H<hi rend="sc">ARDLY</hi> had the muster-in oath of allegiance to the Government and
						obedience to those in command of her armies, been administered, before orders were
						received by Col. Reed to report his command for duty. Then came a trying hour for the
						citizen-soldier. It was to be his first departure from home for the field of war. The
						toils of march, exposures of camp, scenes of carnage, new and untried duties, the most
						laborious and perilous that could be presented, were immediately before him. All the
						endearments of the past, entwined around the home fireside, and the peaceful
						associations of town and neighborhood, were to be left behind, with the probabilities
						all against a renewal thereafter. He did not bid parents, wife, children, lovers and
						friends farewell because he loved war, or sought to follow it as a temporary business,
						or for gain. His preferences and greatest pleasures were in the peaceful pursuits now
						abandoned. But a monitor in his heart whispered Duty, save the Union, save it for your
						children, save it for all posterity, save it for freedom, save it for God. These
						whisperings decided the internal conflict, and he grasped his musket and knapsack at the
						bugle's call, fell into line ready for the command, "Forward, march."</p>

					<pb id="VAB1849-025" n="15"/>

					<p>That command came the next day, November 23d, 1861. The Regiment never made a better
						display of the pageantry of war than on that day, as it marched through the city to the
						depot. Never thereafter were all the men and officers in line at the same time. The
						uniform and equipment of men and officers were then unsoiled. The imposing scene was
						witnessed by thousands who thronged the streets. Many hearts among the throng ached to
						breaking, and groans of anguish were not unfrequently heard to break forth from the
						burdened souls of fathers, mothers and wives.</p>
					<p>Upon reaching the public square, the Regiment was formed in hollow square, to receive a
						beautiful flag donated by the patriotic women of the city. The flag was presented by
						Hon. F. P. Randall, the Mayor, who addressed the Regiment as follows:</p>

					<p>
						<hi rend="i center">Address of Mayor Randall.</hi>
						<lb/>
						<hi rend="left sc">SOLDIERS OF THE 44TH REGIMENT-OFFICERS AND MEN:</hi>
					</p>
					<p>In common with thousands of your fellow citizens, who have so nobly responded to the
						call of the Government, you have now laid aside for a time the character of civilians
						and assumed that of soldiers, and now form a part of the grand army of the North.</p>
					<p>I congratulate the field officers of the Regiment that they have gathered around them
						soldiers so fine and intelligent in appearance and so manly in bearing; and I
						congratulate the Regiment that they have as sagacious, brave and gallant officers.</p>
					<p>The history of the world furnishes no example like that we now see occurring around us.
						Five hundred thousand brave men have voluntarily left the endearments and comforts of
						home, to sustain the Government <pb id="VAB1849-026" n="16"/> of their choice, and
						millions will be ready to respond if their country needs them. This is a Government in
						which all participate, in which all have an equal interest, and to the support of which
						all should be equally devoted. The humblest citizen, equally with the President himself,
						can in truth say, this is my government. And as you are about to leave us to join the
						armed hosts which have preceded you, through the kind liberality of some of our friends
						residing in this city, I have the pleasure of presenting to your Regiment these National
						Colors. Banners are representatives of Nations. This, with its thirty-four stars,
						represents the whole Union as it was before treason had begun its work of destruction.
						To it patriotism now looks with ardent hopes, and upon it hang the destinies of this
						Nation. Glorious memories cluster around the Stars and Stripes. For more than eighty
						years the people of all the States have been proud of this emblem of our country's
						greatness and power. It has protected the American citizen in all his wanderings,
						however distant from home business or pleasure may have called him; and the mariner, as
						he sailed upon the deep blue sea, bound to the farthest isles of the ocean, whilst the
						American flag floated at the mast, pursued his journey in conscious pride and
						security.</p>
					<p>But while thus honored at home and respected abroad, traitors and rebels have banded
						together, and with a united effort are now madly striving to strike it down from its
						high position, to trample it in the dust and scatter the fragments over all the land. To
						prevent this desecration of our flag and the consequent destruction of the Government it
						represents, the armies of the North have been called into existence, and are now
						marching to the field of battle.</p>
					<p>Seven long years of toil, privation, frequent disaster and bloody conflicts were spent
						by the brave men of '76 <pb id="VAB1849-027" n="17"/> to give freedom to this land and a
						nationality to this flag. I believe the spirit of our ancestors still lives among us,
						and that the loyal and patriotic people of the present generation will nobly protect and
						defend what cost our fathers so much to establish. In committing this banner to your
						charge, I have every confidence that you will safely guard and protect it, if necessary,
						with life itself.</p>
					<p>I almost envy you the privilege which you are so soon to have, in fighting in its
						defense; and when you meet the enemies of our country in deadly strife, <q
							rend="blockquote">
							<lg rend="center">
								<l>"midst flame and smoke,</l>
								<l>And shout and groan, and saber stroke,</l>
								<l>And death-shots falling thick and fast,"</l>
							</lg>
						</q> may some kind angel be sent to accompany this flag, to defend you from the perils
						incident to the battle-field, and guide you on to victory; and if in that hour anything
						is required beyond your love of country to stimulate you to deeds of noble daring,
						remember that your friends and relatives at home will share with you the glory of your
						victory as in some measure their own, while they will sorrow for any misfortune that may
						befall you as for a personal calamity.</p>
					<p>You are making history for yourselves and for our State. Already have the gallant deeds
						achieved by the Indiana volunteers made a brilliant record in the history of this war.
						You, I know, will never dim the lustre of that record. You have cheerfully responded to
						the call of your country in this her hour of danger, and are now ready to join those who
						are fighting the battles of Freedom in Freedom's holy land.</p>
					<p>You go to suppress this treason and put down this unprovoked rebellion, and save us
						from the threatened rule of traitors and despots, who in their mad ambition would with
						ruthless hands pull down and destroy the <pb id="VAB1849-028" n="18"/> freest and best

						and patriotism calls you to go.</p>
					<p>Blessings brighten as they take their flight; and this national ensign, now that the
						storm-cloud dark and portentous is rolling up from the South, is dearer to all of our
						hearts at this moment, yes, a thousand fold dearer, than it ever was before when gilded
						with the sunshine of prosperity anld playing with the zephyrs of peace. It speaks for
						itself far more eloquently than I can speak for it. Listen to its voice of patriotism.
						It speaks of earlier and of later struggles in the cause of freedom. It speaks of
						victories on the sea and on the land. It speaks of statesmen and heroes among the living
						and among the dead. But before all and above all other associations and memories,
						whether of glorious men, or of glorious deeds, or of glorious places, it speaks
						trumpet-tongued for the union of these States, now and forever. Let it tell the story of
						its birth to these gallant volunteers as they march beneath its folds by day or repose
						around its sentinel stars by night. Let it recall to their memories the eventful history
						of its origin, its cost in toil and blood. Let it rehearse to them its trials and its
						triumphs in peace and in war; and whatever else may happen to it or them, it will never
						be prostituted to the unholy purpose of revenge or depredation; it will never be
						surrendered to rebels, or ignominiously struck to treason.</p>


					<pb id="VAB1849-029" n="19"/>

					<p>And now, before placing it in your hands, I desire to ask a few questions, to which you

					<p>Do you solemnly promise to love this flag?</p>
					<p>[Yes.]</p>
					<p>Do you promise to honor it?</p>
					<p>[Yes.]</p>
					<p>Do you promise to obey it?</p>
					<p>[Yes.]</p>
					<p>Do you promise to sustain and defend it, even unto death?</p>
					<p>[Yes.]</p>
					<p>I, then, in this presence and before these witnesses, solemnly join you to the American
						Flag; and what we have now joined together let not Jeff. Davis or his minions put
						asunder.</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">
						<lg>
							<l>"Now bless this Banner, God of Hosts, watch o'er each starry fold:</l>
							<l>'Tis Freedom's Standard, tried and proved, on many a field of old</l>

					<p>Adjutant Charles Case responded briefly, on behalf of the Regiment, pledging the Mayor,

						<lb/>
						<hi rend="sc center">IN THE FIELD.--INDIANAPOLIS, EVANSVILLE, AND HENDERSON.</hi>
					</head>
					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> Regiment reached Indianapolis about 3 o'clock A. M., the 24th,
						the next day after leaving Fort Wayne, in the midst of a snow-storm, and for the first
						time went into tents. The equipage and clothing of the command were now completed, and
						on the 26th the Regiment started, by way of the Terre Haute and Vincennes railroad, for
						Evansville, where the commanding officer was ordered to report by letter to Gen. T. J.
						Crittenden, at Calhoun, Kentucky.</p>
					<p>Upon their arrival at Evansville, the Regiment was most agreeably surprised to find a
						dinner in waiting, at the market-house, an offering of respect and loyal devotion on the
						part of the citizens of the city. The Regiment went into camp in the eastern suburbs of
						the city, and for a few days suffered no little from exposure to the cold and unusually
						inclement weather. It was then thought rather rough soldiering, but many times after
						would have been accepted with feelings of much relief. The sick list now began to
						increase rapidly, but mainly as the result of measles, which was becoming prevalent in
						all the companies. On the 31st the number of sick in the Regimental Hospital had run up
						to thirty, with many men sick in quarters. The Marine Hospital, a <pb id="VAB1849-031"
							n="21"/> Government institution for the benefit of the marine service, was opened for
						the reception of sick soldiers, and all who could not be comfortably cared for in
						Regimental quarters were sent there for treatment. The first death since leaving Fort
						Wayne occurred here, in Regimental Hospital, that of David Wert, Co. E. He died with
						strong confidence in the Christian faith, and was buried with military honors in the
						city cemetery, all the officers of the Regiment, and nearly all the soldiers,
						attending.</p>
					<p>Pursuant to orders from Gen. Crittenden, the Regiment set out on its first march,
						December 11th, for Henderson, Kentucky, a point twelve miles distant by land, on the
						opposite side of the Ohio river. The march was made upon the Indiana side, and the
						landing opposite Henderson was reached about three o'clock in the afternoon. The
						Regiment crossed over in ferry boats, and then marching through the city with flying
						colors, went into camp in a beautiful grove in the suburbs. Kentucky, though it had at
						first contended for a neutral position between those attempting to sever the Union and
						those determined to uphold it, and had opposed the entrance upon her soil of the armies
						of each, had found it impossible to hold to such a silly and unpatriotic position, if
						such were really the intention of the leaders. Union and Rebel armies were now
						manœuvring for position and preparing for battle upon her soil, and thousands of her
						citizens had joined the armies of each side. The State Government had passed under rebel
						influence, and the Union soldiers felt, when touching the Kentucky shore, that they were
						in the <pb id="VAB1849-032" n="22"/> enemy's country. Such were the feelings of the men
						of the Forty-fourth Indiana when they crossed the Ohio river at Henderson. Though the
						place professed loyalty, the coolness with which the command was received, and the
						expressed sympathy of many for the rebel cause, were so much in contrast with the
						enthusiastic reception accorded the command on the Indiana side, that the men felt the
						necessity, and the officers in command the imperative duty, of taking all the
						precautions obligatory in face of an enemy. Pickets were thrown out, and the Regiment
						kept in readiness for action.</p>
					<p>On November 9th the Military Department of the Ohio had been formed, consisting of the
						States of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, and that portion of Kentucky east of the Cumberland
						River and the State of Tennessee, and General Buell was placed in command on the 3d of
						December. General Thomas J. Crittenden was appointed commander of the Fifth Division of
						the Army of the Ohio, comprising the 11th, 13th, and 14th Brigades. The 13th Brigade
						consisted of the 31st Indiana Infantry, Col. Charles Cruft; 44th Indiana, Col. H. B.
						Reed; 17th Kentucky, Col. J. H. McHenry; 25th Kentucky, Col. James W. Shackleford.
						Colonel Cruft was assigned to the command of the Brigade.</p>
					<p>General Crittenden's headquarters were at this time at Calhoun, upon Green River, some
						forty miles distant across the country. All of his regiments except the Forty-fourth
						were in that vicinity. The enemy had threatened an attack on his lines from
						Hopkinsviile, and had advanced as far as Greenville, late in November, but deflected
						from there to Bowling Green, near <pb id="VAB1849-033" n="23"/> where was encamped the
						centre of the Army of the Ohio, under the command of General A. M. D. McCook. General
						Thomas held the left of the line, in Eastern Kentucky, with the rebel General
						Zollicoffer in his front. The Forty-fourth Indiana was alone on the extreme right of
						General Buell's forces. Though, as afterward appeared, no considerable body of the enemy
						was near, there were enough rumors and alarms to keep the command in readiness for
						battle, and to give to the needed drill exercises the zest and interest that would
						insure most efficiency.</p>
					<p>There were rumors to the effect that the enemy was marauding the country in the
						vicinity and gathering up all the live stock possible, for the support of the
						Confederate forces. These rumors having assumed an apparently reliable form, the Colonel
						concluded to send out a force to investigate the matter, and if possible capture the
						parties. On the 16th of December two detachments of fifty men each, one under command of
						Captain Kinney and the other under Captain Merrill, Co. F, set out on their first march,
						in search of the marauders. The Captains were ordered to proceed as far as Highland
						Creek, eighteen miles distant, and were to strike that stream at two points, supposed to
						be about five miles apart, at the same time, and then each to march to a point midway,
						expecting to find the enemy between. Captain Kinney's detachment reached the designated
						point on time, and then marched down the stream to the place of union, but neither the
						enemy nor the other detachment was found. In the meantime Captain Heath, Co. I, and a
						messenger, had <pb id="VAB1849-034" n="24"/> come up on horseback, with orders from
						camp. These and the Assistant Surgeon volunteered to go in search of Captain Merrill and
						his detachment, and starting about nine o'clock at night, traveled until break of day,
						when the command was found fifteen miles distant from the other, the two roads striking
						the creek that much farther apart than was reported. The two detachments were then
						brought together, thus consuming the whole of that day. In the meantime the camp had
						become alarmed, and Lieutenant-Colonel Crosthwait was sent out with another detail of
						one hundred men to our aid. All returned in two days, without a sight of the enemy or of
						the hogs he was reported to be stealing.</p>
					<p>This little ripple, the first in camp life, was known as the "Hog Expedition." The most
						serious result was the disability of the Lieutenant- Colonel. The exposure and toil
						occasioned a recurrence of chronic diarrhœa, contracted during the Mexican war. He was
						furloughed and went home, where he died February 20th, 1862, greatly to the grief of the
						command.</p>
					<p>The remainder of the month of December was quietly spent in camp. The ravages of the
						measles kept up a large sick list, but otherwise the command maintained comparatively
						good health. About one hundred and fifty had been sent to hospital since reaching
						Evansville. A regimental hospital was established in an old hotel building in Henderson,
						of which Surgeon Martin took charge. Two patriotic women--Mrs. Burch, wife of Joseph
						Burch, Co. A, and Sarah Eldridge, wife of Henry Eldridge, Co. K,--under the impression
						that the Government would allow the employment of hospital <pb id="VAB1849-035" n="25"/>
						matrons, accompanied the regimental hospital up to this time, rendering much service to
						the sick.</p>
					<p>The first few weeks in Kentucky were novel, even outside of the new and before untried
						duties of a soldier. With very few exceptions, not a member of the Regiment had trodden
						slave soil before. They came to it, many of them, with feelings of extreme hostility to
						the institution of slavery, many with feelings of indifference, and a few, possibly,
						with sentiments of approval. But to all, the sight of a slave at daily, unrequited toil
						was new. Henderson county then ranked second in the State in the number of slaves held.
						It was reported that there were over 4,000 slaves in the county. The following extract
						from a private letter, written from the camp, will be of interest in showing the
						position of the Government, and sentiment of the soldiers, at that time:</p>
					<p>" A good negro hires here for from $200 to $300 a year, the hirer bearing all loss by
						sickness, paying doctor bills, etc. A pretty cosy way of living, that--take one of your
						fellow men and hire him for $200 a year, and pocket the money yourself! Negro stock,
						though, is down now--prices one-third lower and few sales. Not a soldier nor officer has
						attempted to tamper with the institution. They would be severely punished if they
						should. Even conversation with the slaves is prohibited. The Union men here are very
						tender upon this point. Should we tamper with the slaves there would soon be an uproar.
						It is not our mission here to steal 'niggers.' If they want to leave and can follow our
						trail back, they may, for all of us. We can render them no assistance in getting away,
						or their masters in holding them. The secessionists here would really like <pb
							id="VAB1849-036" n="26"/> some of the soldiers to run off a few, that they might raise
						a howl. We will not accommodate them in that line; though, if some of the boys knew it
						would get up a fight here [for which some were just then spoiling], they would be
						tempted to try it. We are in the service of our country, intend to obey her laws and
						fight her battles, and do naught but what we are authorized to do.</p>
					<p>"Four or five free negroes living near here were stolen a few nights ago, and taken
						South; two of whom were land-holders. The rascally kidnappers went to their houses and
						presented an order signed, they said, by Colonel Reed, requesting them to come to camp.
						They started, as they supposed, for the camp, but soon after learned their mistake. One
						of them, a father, succeeded in making his escape, but one of his sons was taken along.
						The father came to the camp and offered Colonel Reed his farm and that of his son if he
						would rescue his boy. The Colonel could not interfere."</p>
					<p>Such were the sentiments of even the loyal people then, and such the orders of the
						Government; that a commander of troops on slave soil, fighting for the union of the
						States attempted to be overthrown by a rebellion whose corner-stone was acknowledged to
						be slavery, could fight his whole command to recapture hogs stolen to feed the rebel
						army, but not to rescue a brother man with a dark face, stolen to serve the men in the
						rebel army. Is it to be wondered at that a God of Justice deferred a speedy victory to a
						people so imbued with the evil whose aggressions they were fighting to overcome? But in
						a few days, on January 1st, 1862, many of the command witnessed in Henderson the last
						auction, there, of human slaves. Relief came to the slave before it did to his
						master.</p>


					<pb id="VAB1849-037" n="27"/>

					<p>Upon this day the Colonel received orders to report at Calhoun, with eight companies of
						his command, and to leave two companies at Henderson until further orders. The companies
						detailed to remain were Co. G, Captain Williams, and Co. K, Captain Aldrich. The
						sick--some sixty in all--were left in charge of the Assistant Surgeon. On the 12th of
						January he was ordered to place the remaining sick in care of a resident physician, and
						join the command at Calhoun.</p>
					<p>The deaths in the command during 1861 were: <list type="simple">
							<item>Francis Brooks, Co. A, at Camp Allen, Fort Wayne, of apoplexy, October

					<pb id="VAB1849-038" n="28"/>

					<p>"Following the departure of the Regiment, the battalion moved to the fair ground and
						guarded all the approaches to the town, and was kept almost constantly on duty until the
						evening of January 28th, when a courier brought orders from General Crittenden to take
						immediate possession of the city and secure the strongest buildings for quarters, as a
						hostile force was approaching. Speedily tents were struck and loaded, and the troops
						marched in and took possession of the court house, despite strong opposition by the
						rebel sheriff, who refused the keys until told that the doors would otherwise be broken
						open. An exciting scene followed. The rebel element swore the soldiers must be driven
						out, but the Unionists sided with the troops. Meetings were held, irate speeches made,
						and resolutions passed, but the patrols dispersed the secessionists, and the battalion
						stood to arms during the ensuing night, fully expecting to fight the coming enemy, aided
						by the rebels in the city. With morning came the Sixtieth Indiana, and two companies of
						Home Guards from Evansville. This reinforcement caused the enemy to abandon their
						design. A hotel across the street, used as rebel headquarters, was occupied, and the
						stars and stripes hoisted from the roof. During the morning Jacob Fink, Co. K, hearing
						an insulting remark about Governor Morton by a secessionist, would have shot him had not
						a sergeant seized his gun, and ordered the rebel to leave, which he did forthwith. The
						reinforcements returned February 2d to Evansville, leaving the battalion to continue
						unmolested the round of guard drill and other duties."</p>
					<p>These two companies rejoined the Regiment on the Tennessee River, near Fort Henry, on
						the 10th of March.</p>



					<pb id="VAB1849-039" n="29"/>

					</head>

					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> Colonel, with eight companies of his Regiment, who had set out
						on the march overland for Calhoun, after a very unpleasant tramp of four days through
						mud, rain and slush, reached Calhoun on the 6th of January, and went into camp, which
						they at once commenced to prepare for winter quarters. But this occupation was very
						short, as on the 15th of January General Crittenden moved his whole command, except one
						regiment and the sick, ten miles up Green River, to South Carrolton. Here the Regiment
						again went into camp. The weather during the stay at Calhoun and South Carrolton was
						exceedingly inclement, and the sick list was fearfully increased. The Surgeon's monthly
						report for January showed 86 remaining sick at last report, and 114 taken sick during
						the month. Of these, 5 had died, 1 had been furloughed, 7 sent to General Hospital, 103
						returned to duty, leaving 84 sick on hand. These only included hospital cases. Probably
						three times as many more were treated in camp, and temporarily exempted from duty.</p>
					<p>The troops moved to South Carrolton consisted of the 31st Indiana, Colonel Cruft; 43d
						Indiana, Colonel Steele; 44th Indiana, Colonel Reed; 42 Indiana, Colonel <pb
							id="VAB1849-041" n="31"/> Jones; 11th Kentucky, Colonel Hawkins; 25th Kentucky,
						Colonel Shackleford; 26th Kentucky, Colonel Burbridge; --th Kentucky Cavalry, Colonel
						Jackson, and two battalions of artillery.</p>
					<p>An advance of rebel forces from Bowling Green was anticipated here, and on the 25th of
						January the command was speedily set to work felling trees in front, and throwing up
						breastworks; but after two or three days of hard toil for the soldiers, the alarm
						subsided. On the 30th the sick were ordered to be taken to boat to be carried back to
						Calhoun, preparatory to the movement of the whole command back to that place. The writer
						went to one of the boats, and found such as were able to walk crowding on by hundreds,
						but none, however sick, were allowed to enter the cabin. After some words with the
						captain of the boat, he returned and reported to Surgeon Martin. The Doctor's
						indignation was aroused, as it was quickly on all occasions when the sick in his charge
						were heedlessly treated or insulted, and not having, as yet, learned military restraint,
						he seized his revolver, ordered four or five soldiers with muskets in their hands to
						accompany him, and the Assistant Surgeon to follow with the sick. The cabin doors
						opened, upon his demand, though in a somewhat damaged condition, and the floor was soon
						covered with the sick. The Surgeon's popularity among the soldiers was advanced
						materially, and he was never disturbed for the act.</p>
					<p>The Regiment marched by land to Calhoun, February 1st, and went into camp, but to rest
						a few days only. Colonel Cruft was ordered to report with all the efficient <pb
							id="VAB1849-042" n="32"/> men of his brigade to General Grant, on the Tennessee River,
						and on the 9th boarded boats for that point. The Assistant Surgeon was again detailed to
						remain behind with the sick, the detail covering the care of the sick of the 25th
						Kentucky, also. The march to and from South Carrolton, and the inclement weather, had
						brought very many down, and at that early stage of the war the facilities for caring for
						the sick were very poor and inadequate. At Calhoun there were probably nearly a thousand
						sick altogether, and no general hospital provisions whatever. The sick were sheltered
						from the storms and cared for as well as possible, in bar-rooms, old vacant buildings, a
						church, a masonic hall, and scattered around in dwelling houses. There were left of the
						Forty-fourth Indiana, 76 sick in hospital, so called, and 61 in camp quarters. The
						Twenty-fifth Kentucky left 90 sick, most of them being crowded in the audience room of a
						church. The care of so many sick, under such circumstances, was an exceedingly hard task
						for one physician, and was indeed the most toilsome and responsible he had during over
						four years of service.</p>
					<p>The diseases most prevalent were pneumonia and typhoid fever, and the situation and
						weather as unfavorable as they well could be, for their successful treatment. There died
						at Calhoun, during the winter of 1861-2:</p>

									<salute rend="left">Col. Charles Cruft, commanding First Brigade, Third
										Division:</salute>
									<p>SIR:--On the morning of February 15, the Forty-fourth Regiment Indiana
										Volunteers left their bivouac near the enemy's lines, and marched to the attack
										on Fort Donelson. By order of General McClernand we first took position near a
										battery, which was afterward assaulted by the rebels. In this position the
										enemy's shot flew over our heads. Shortly after, we were ordered forward into
										line with our brigade. As we marched past the enemy's breastworks we received a
										heavy fire, wounding some of our men. We took our position on the left wing of
										the brigade, in front of and within range of the enemy's guns; they were
										invisible to us, while we were exposed to their view. There was part of a
										regiment of Union troops (Colonel Logan's) on the slope of the hill between us
										and the enemy. Colonel Logan came to our line and requested we would not fire,
										as it would endanger his men. I gave the order to the men to withhold their
										fire. We remained exposed to the enemy's fire for fifteen or twenty minutes,
										without being able to return it, or to determine whether our friends were still
										in danger from our guns. At this time the enemy's fire partly subsiding, the
										regimental colors were ordered forward, and were planted ten paces in front of
										the line of battle by First-Lieutenant Story, of Company C. This failing to call
										forth a fire, Captain <pb id="VAB1849-047" n="37"/> Bingham, Company H, advanced
										to a point ten or twelve paces farther in front of our line, and waved our
										colors in the air. This drew his fire, which was most heartily responded to by
										our men, and was followed up in rapid succession on both sides. Our men behaved
										most gallantly. In the early part of the action, Captain Cuppy, Company E, was
										severely wounded, while in advance of his men cheering them on.</p>
									<p>By this time the regiment on our left having entirely changed its position,
										leaving our flank exposed, a movement was made by a well-mounted cavalry
										regiment, and a body of infantry, to turn our left wing. Captain Murray, Company
										B, was ordered to open fire upon them, and did so with terrific effect.
										Companies E and H were ordered to the support of Company B, and poured in a
										well-directed fire, causing them to fall back in disorder. At this time, finding
										my regiment entirely alone and unsupported, the regiments on the left having
										withdrawn and our brigade having changed position to the right, (thus exposing
										both wings, of which the enemy was about to take advantage,) the order was given
										to change position to the right, which was done by a right flank in good order;
										with the exception of a part of the left wing, which, from not having fully
										understood the order, became separated from the main body, and some confusion
										ensued. But in a few minutes they rejoined us. Ours was the last regiment
										engaged with the enemy during the fight in the morning. Having joined the
										brigade, we took position on an adjoining elevation, and awaited orders.</p>
									<p>Major Stoughton, posted during the entire action in the most exposed position,
										deserves the highest praise for the cool courage and daring displayed. I would
										gladly mention instances of personal bravery during the entire day. Too much
										credit cannot be bestowed on our <pb id="VAB1849-048" n="38"/> men for their
										cool and determined courage, and especially during the trying time when exposed
										to the enemy's bullets, without being permitted to return it--both officers and
										men, in this our first engagement; but where almost all performed their part so
										well, it would require too lengthy a list to name them personally, while many,
										justly deserving, might be unintentionally omitted. The Forty-fourth did its
										duty. We lost in the engagement 7 killed, 34 wounded, and 2 missing.</p>
									<p>From our position on the hill where our column rested we could see the
										battle-field in the morning, and the enemy again form his line of battle, at
										about half-past three o'clock P.M. A renewed attack upon his lines was ordered
										by General Wallace. My regiment advanced to the foot of the hill occupied by the
										enemy, formed in line of battle in face of a storm of bullets, finding the
										ground occupied by the Eighth Missouri. I advanced my regiment up the hill at
										double quick; our men, loudly cheering, advanced rapidly to the summit of the
										hill, firing at the enemy. The enemy soon retreated inside his entrenchments,
										closely followed by our troops. A fire was opened on us by their batteries, the
										shells falling near our lines. Whilst deliberating upon an attack on the
										fortifications, we received an order from General Grant to fall back to the brow
										of the hill, which was done. Here we bivouacked for the night. The following
										morning (Sunday) we were ordered by you to march forward to attack the enemy's
										works. When just ready to march, the joyful intelligence was brought us that the
										enemy had surrendered. Our column being in motion, we were the first to march
										into the town of Dover.</p>

					<p>The cool bravery of the commanding officer of the Regiment, in this his first battle,
						was the admiration and pride of the men. The great chieftain, General Grant, could not
						more coolly smoke his cigar, and give orders in the midst of the clash of armies, than
						did Colonel Reed in this conflict. At the moment of making the charge up the hill, so
						modestly referred to in his report, the Colonel dismounted, gave his horse in charge of
						an orderly, stepped to the front of his Regiment with a pistol in each hand, and called
						upon his men to "Come on." They promptly rushed forward, cheering loudly, and in
						connection with the Eighth Missouri on the right, under Colonel Morgan L Smith, made the
						most brilliant charge of the battle. It was this charge that broke the line of the
						enemy, when he fled back to his entrenchments, and it is believed discovered to him the
						necessity of immediate and unconditional surrender.</p>
					<p>Sergeant Gordon relates, incidental to the second day's action, that some of the
						over-ranged projectiles from the rebel guns fell in the rear, and among the knapsacks of
						the Regiments, scattering them generally, and driving the guards to shelter. A cannon
						ball struck the base drum played by T. B. Totten, Co. F, who became quite excited over
						this unasked help in playing his drum. At night a detail from the Regiment was sent out
						to bring in the wounded, who, in the gloom and darkness, could only be found by their
						moans. Many, in their blood-drenched clothes, were found frozen to the ground. The
						wearied detail, about eight o'clock in the morning, heard a cry near the rebel picket
						line, but deemed it unsafe to go to the relief. Alexander Kinmont, <pb id="VAB1849-050"
							n="40"/> Co. F, who had charge of a detail of seven men, decided to attempt the relief
						of the unknown sufferer, and after some urging pursuaded his comrades to follow him. The
						wounded man was found almost inside the enemy's line, badly wounded, lying on his back,
						and his hair frozen to the earth. They cut him loose and brought him safely into
						hospital.</p>
					<p>As illustrative of the valor of the citizens of northern Indiana, it may not be amiss
						to mention that James R. Devor, then a clerk for the Sutler of the Regiment, borrowed a
						musket, went into this battle "on his own hook," and fired some forty rounds at the
						enemy. Two years after he enlisted, and became a member of the Regiment.</p>
					<p>Soon after the word came that the enemy had surrendered, General Grant and his staff
						rode by, and as he passed the head of the Regiment, he said to Colonel Reed, "Come
						along." The Colonel was not sure whether the order meant himself alone, or his command,
						but to be on the safe side he passed the word "forward" down the line; and the
						Forty-fourth Regiment was the first to enter the town of Dover, and had the honor of
						receiving and stacking the guns of a number of rebel regiments.</p>
					<p>The conduct of the Regiment in this battle elicited much applause at home. A public
						meeting was called at Fort Wayne, and Colerick's hall was filled to overflowing. Hon.
						Lot S. Bayliss, who had been on a visit to the Regiment at the time of the battle, gave
						a description of the part performed by the Forty-fourth, <pb id="VAB1849-051" n="41"/>
						which was followed by resolutions highly complimentary of the officers and men engaged,
						making especial mention of their fellow-citizens, Colonel Reed, Chaplain Beeks, and
						Lieutenant Story, and of Major Stoughton and Surgeon Martin. At this meeting Mrs.
						Charles Case, President of the Ladies' Soldiers' Aid Society of the city, was presented
						a rebel flag, captured from a Virginia regiment, bearing upon it the words: "The
						Faulkner Guards. In God We Trust."</p>

						<hi rend="center sc">FORT HENRY TO PITTSBURG LANDING.--SHILOH BATTLE.</hi>
					</head>

					<p>I<hi rend="sc">MMEDIATELY</hi> after the capture of Fort Donelson the Forty-fourth
						moved with the advance across the country to Fort Henry, and then went into camp. While
						here, it, with the other regiments which constituted the original 13th brigade, and, in
						the recent conflict, the 1st brigade, 3d division, was now assigned to the 4th division,
						General S. A. Hulbert, and numbered the 4th, with Colonel Cruft in temporary
						command.</p>
					<p>On the 10th of March the army again broke camp, and boarding some sixty steamers and
						transports, proceeded by a number of gunboats, moved up the Tennessee river, making
						probable the most imposing display of river craft during the war. There was a halt of
						two or three days at Savannah, during which Companies G and K came up and rejoined the
						Regiment. The fleet moved forward, to Pittsburg Landing, on the 15th, when the 4th
						brigade was the first infantry landed. General Hulbert's division went into camp on the
						Hamburg road, about one mile from the landing, the 4th brigade taking position on the
						left between the road and the river.</p>
					<p>During the voyage up the Tennessee River, and while in camp here, the command suffered
						severely from diarrhœa, which became so generally prevalent that hardly <pb
							id="VAB1849-056" n="44"/> a man in the Regiment was known to be entirely exempt from
						it. The praiseworthy ambition of a commander to make as good a show in numbers as
						possible, of men ready for duty, and the duty of the medical officers to protect the
						sick and disabled, will not always harmonize. The morning sick call, the detection of
						impostors, the excusing of the unfit from duty, always delicate and important duties on
						the part of the surgeons, became here more than usually embarrassing. The Colonel could
						make but a sorry show of men for duty. Not feeling sure that his medical officers were
						not too lenient towards the men, he sent one morning for the Assistant Surgeon who
						attended the sick call and excused the men complaining in quarters, to inquire into the
						matter. The large number who had just been excused seemed to him unnecessarily large.
						The medical officer suggested that all who had reported at sick call that morning, the
						excused and non-excused, be called back, and formed in line in front of the Colonel's
						quarters, and that he and the Chaplain, who was formerly a physician, examine the men
						themselves. The suggestion was adopted, and the result was that the heart of the
						Colonel, who had a quick sympathy for the really suffering, was touched, and the excused
						list was somewhat enlarged, rather than diminished. Confidence in the medical officers
						was also increased, and never thereafter was their verdict of fit or unfit for duty
						called in question. The sick here were mainly treated in regimental hospital. A few were
						taken to the hospital boat, the <hi rend="i">Memphis</hi>, at the Landing. There died
						here, before the battle of Shiloh: <pb id="VAB1849-057" n="45"/>

					<p>Sunday morning, April 6th, 1862, opened as lovely and as beautiful as any sung of by
						the poets. No minister or priest seemed needed to direct the mind upward from nature to
						nature's God. The balmy air, the bright new foliage, glimmering in the rising sun, the
						gentle treble of the blue-birds in the overhanging boughs, seemed all-sufficient to
						awaken in the soul reverential regard for the Author of all beauty and all good. But the
						scene soon changed. The demons of war were let loose. The roar of musketry at the front
						announced the approach of an enemy. The frightened blue-birds ceased their loving
						twitter; the loveliness of nature around ceased to attract the attention of the soldier
						as he hurriedly gathered up his implements of war.</p>
					<p>The command to "fall in " was speedily obeyed, and in a few minutes the whole effective
						force of the Regiment was in line with the brigade, marching to the front. While moving
						to this engagement the Regiment formed its first acquaintance with its new brigade
						commander, who had been assigned to it only the day before --Brigadier-General
						Lauman.</p>

									<salute rend="left">Brigadier-General J. G. Lauman, commanding Third Brigade,
										Fourth Division Army, West Line:</salute>
									<p>SIR:--I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by the
										44th Regiment Indiana Volunteers in the actions of the 6th and 7th, near
										Pittsburg, Tennessee:</p>
									<p>We left our encampment about eight o'clock Sunday morning, with an effective
										force of 478 men, and marched forward to support General Prentiss' division,
										which had been attacked by the enemy. We had gone but a short distance when we
										met his men retreating in much confusion. We proceeded about one mile, and took
										position in line of battle in rear of a camp lately occupied by him. We formed
										our line under fire from the enemy's battery,--Colonel Cruft, 31st Indiana, on
										our right; Lieutenant-Colonel Bristow, 25th Kentucky, and Colonel McHenry, 17th
										Kentucky, on our left. I sent forward First-Lieutenant Wayne, Co. D, and First
										Lieutenant Barton, Co. B, each with a part of their respective companies, as
										skirmishers, in front of our line. They were soon driven in, and the whole line
										of the 44th and 31st Indiana furiously assaulted by the enemy, and as gallantly
										met, our men behaving in the coolest manner possible, loading and firing with
										the utmost rapidity; and with so much zeal did they enter into it, that the
										officers had only to watch the fight as a matter of interest rather than of
										duty. The enemy was driven off with immense loss. They again rallied, and
										charged up to within a few rods of our line, and were again repulsed. You,
										General, were with us, and have <pb id="VAB1849-059" n="47"/> since gone over
										the ground so gallantly contested, and have witnessed how terribly destructive
										was our fire-- the ground being literally strewn with their dead. But again they
										formed in column, and charged over an open field on our left, and in front of
										the 17th and 25th Kentucky, the gallant Colonel McHenry commanding, who poured
										into their ranks a most terrible fire. I immediately wheeled two companies of my
										left wing to the left, and opened upon his flank; his ranks were mown down at
										each fire, but he still pressed forward; and as bravely was he received. His
										front rank went down, leaving a line of dead across his front, when he retreated
										in good order.</p>
									<p>This ending the engagement here, we were ordered to the support of the line on
										our left, about half a mile distant, which had fallen back. We took position on
										the left of, and supporting Willard's battery, which soon commenced playing upon
										the enemy, and we were soon charged upon in large force; and here was the most
										hotly contested fight of the day, being in an open field, with the exception of
										a few scattering trees--the enemy far outnumbering us, and fighting with
										desperate courage. The fire was fearfully severe, but our officers and men
										behaved with heroic bravery, never for a moment swerving from their position,
										pouring in their fire with the coolness of veterans, and driving the enemy
										before them; but again and again, with fresh troops, they advanced to the
										charge. Our ammunition being expended, a part of a regiment was ordered up by
										you, to take our place while our boxes were refilled. In a few minutes we again
										entered the fight, and charged forward far in advance of our former line. Our
										color-bearer and guard were either killed or wounded, at the same moment, and
										two other brave men in succession being shot down, and our flag riddled with
										balls, Lieutenant Newman, in command of Company H, bore it aloft, but soon fell
											<pb id="VAB1849-060" n="48"/> mortally wounded. It was again taken by our
										brave men; and carried to the front, both officers and men rallying with heroic
										energy to its support. Captain Murray, Company B, acting Captain George Weamer,
										and acting Lieutenant Warren Banta, Company E, fell mortally wounded. Lieutenant
										Kinmont, in command of Company F, and Captain Cosgrove, Company D, were severely
										wounded. Space will not permit mentioning many instances of personal bravery,
										nor is it necessary where all acted nobly. By this time our cartridges were
										again expended. You ordered up the 31st Indiana, which had occupied position as
										a reserve in our rear, to relieve us. We accordingly moved back in good order,
										and took position near a battery, by order of General Hulbert. The enemy, in
										tremendous force, drove back our lines, when we again changed position to the
										right, by order of General Hulbert. Soon after this you rejoined us, and at your
										suggestion I drew up in line across the road by which the enemy was advancing,
										and opened fire upon him. We were here entirely unsupported--our friends passing
										on. I moved my regiment by the right of companies to the rear, and retired by
										the flank to the battery on the hill in our rear, where we again formed in line
										in support of battery. The enemy made his attack on our left. A fierce contest
										ensued, in which some of our men were engaged. Night coming on, the enemy
										withdrew. We advanced our line 150 paces in front of the battery, and rested on
										our arms during the night.</p>
									<p>On Monday morning we were relieved by fresh troops; our men, worn out and
										drenched to the skin by the pelting storm (as General Hulbert knows, having
										spent the night with us), and having been twenty-four hours without food or
										rest, were given a few hours to prepare for the approaching battle. At about ten
											<pb id="VAB1849-061" n="49"/> o'clock you again called us into line, the
										Forty-fourth on the right wing. Our brigade, sadly reduced in numbers, but still
										ready for the fight, was put on march for the battle-field, and was led by you
										to the extreme right, to support General Sherman's division, where we arrived at
										a very opportune moment. We found the enemy charging upon and driving our forces
										to our left and front, over cleared ground, and used as drill ground by our
										troops. I immediately brought my regiment into line, and opened fire on the
										enemy. Our charge took them by surprise. They immediately retreated to the right
										and rear. Colonel McHenry, bringing up the left wing of our brigade, charged
										forward into the thickest of the fight. The enemy slowly retreated, returning
										our fire. Their battery also opened upon us. We pursued them over half a mile,
										but not knowing the position of our forces, I called a halt. At this moment,
										seeing General Sherman at a short distance, I rode to him and reported for
										orders--(having your horse shot under you, I was unable to find you at the
										moment). General Sherman ordered me not to advance further, but form our line
										where we were. Our men had become much scattered in the pursuit of the enemy,
										leaving us but a small force; and fresh regiments coming up to our
										support--amongst them the gallant 30th Indiana, Colonel Bass--the enemy were
										attacked with renewed energy, and after a fierce and bloody contest of half or
										three-quarters of an hour, were driven from the field.</p>
									<p>During the fight of Sunday and Monday my regiment fired over 160 rounds of
										cartridges at the enemy. No men ever fought more bravely; too high praise can
										not be given them. Captain Murray and First Lieutenant Barton, Co. B, Lieutenant
										Newman, commanding Co. H, Captain Tannehill and Lieutenant Grund, Co. C, Captain
										Williams and Lieutenants Shoemaker and <pb id="VAB1849-062" n="50"/> Carey, Co.
										G, Captain Cosgrove and Lieutenant Wayne, Co. D, Captain Aldrich and Lieutenants
										Wilson and Bennett, Co. K, Acting Captain George Weamer, Lieutenant McDonald and
										Acting Lieutenant Warren Banta, Co. E, Lieutenant Kinmont, commanding Co. F, and
										Acting Lieutenants Gansenhouser and Kinmont of same company, Lieutenant Hodges,
										in command of Co. I, and Lieutenant Curtiss, of same company, Lieutenant Burge
										Smith and Acting Lieutenant Ulum, Co. A, were all in the thickest of the fight,
										and no men ever fought more heroically, and justly deserve mention. I am greatly
										indebted to Lieutenant Colonel Stoughton for his valuable aid; there is no
										braver man. He had his horse shot from under him, and was thrown with much force
										to the ground, in the fight on Monday; and to Acting Major Heath, Captain of Co.
										I, to whom too high praise cannot be given for his bravery and devotion to his
										duties. Adjutant Colgrove had his horse shot under him. Nor ought I to forget
										the bravery and devotion to their duties of our surgeons, Drs. Martin and
										Rerick. They were with the regiment at all times during the fight, caring for
										the wounded, and were exposed to the enemy's shot, and were both hit with balls.
										Lieutenants Wayne and John Frampton deserve mention for their devotion to our
										flag in Monday's fight. I cannot refrain from giving expression to my
										admiration, and bearing testimony to the noble and heroic manner in which
										General Hulbert and yourself exposed your lives in your constant and unwearied
										efforts. Each of you was at all times to be seen at your several posts,
										directing the battle. No General, in my opinion, ever conducted a fight with
										more ability, or displayed greater bravery.</p>
									<p>Our loss in these engagements is 34 killed, 177 wounded, and one taken
										prisoner.</p>

					<p>We think the part performed by the Forty-fourth on the first day, at Shiloh, was never
						fully appreciated. The firmness of General Hulbert's division saved the day. General
						Lauman's brigade, of that division, held all the positions assigned it during the day,
						and did not retire until ordered, and the Forty-fourth was the last regiment to retire
						on the left of the army; and the Colonel saw no pressing necessity to retire then,
						except the want of ammunition and support.</p>
					<p>General Lauman, an Iowa man, in his report says:</p>
					<p>" When I come to speak of the gallantry and bravery of the officers and men of my
						command, I find great difficulty in finding language strong enough to express my
						feelings on the subject, and can only say that they fought from morning until night like
						veterans. Well may Indiana and Kentucky be proud of them. They have added another bright
						page to their martial history; and when all behaved so well, I find great difficulty in
						giving to each one the particular notice they so well earned. * * To Colonel Hugh B.
						Reed, of the 44th Indiana, I am under many obligations, not only for his gallantry, but
						also for the valuable assistance he rendered me after my personal staff was disabled, in
						conveying orders to the different parts of the command."</p>
					<p>General Hulbert, in his report, says of General Lauman:</p>
					<p>"I saw him hold the right of my line on Sunday with the small body of gallant men, only
						1,717 strong, for three hours, and then change over to the left, repel the attack of
						twice his force for a full hour of terrible fighting, closing by the most gallant and
						successful <pb id="VAB1849-064" n="52"/> charge, which gave him time to draw off his
						forces in order and comparative safety. His report renders full justice to his officers,
						among whom Colonel Reed, of the 44th Indiana, was especially distinguished."</p>
					<p>The Colonel's conduct on the field richly merited these compliments, and much more. In
						consideration of his gallantry, President Lincoln sent in his name to the Senate for a
						Brigadier's commission, but it was accompanied by so many others that the Senate failed
						to act upon all, his name among others. It would hardly be possible for a mortal to act
						more bravely in battle than he did. He was in the thickest of the fight on both days,
						had two horses killed under him, and had his clothing pierced with bullets in several
						places, but wonderfully escaped serious injury.</p>
					<p>One of the immediate chroniclers of the war, a correspondent of the Philadelphia <hi
							rend="i">Press</hi>, after the battle, wrote that it was universally admitted that <hi
							rend="i">the</hi> Forty-fourth was the regiment at Pittsburgh Landing. Once when it
						made one of the brilliant stands against overwhelming odds, on Sunday, while companions
						fell back on either hand, a captain of one of the retiring companies of Wisconsin
						soldiers, said the Forty-fourth "fought like iron men--they wouldn't run." Perhaps that
						was the origin of the phrase, or it may have been a general thought--but however it
						came, it stuck, and for a long time the Regiment was known as the "Iron
						Forty-fourth."</p>
					<p>"Early on Sunday morning," the writer continues, "Colonel Reed gave his men an order to
						'fall and fire.' Simultaneously the enemy fired, and killed and <pb id="VAB1849-065"
							n="53"/> wounded some of the Indianians. The result of the fire from our side was of
						the most disastrous nature. The bushes were discovered to be in a blaze, and the groans
						of the rebel wounded were distressing, as the fact became apparent that they were
						perishing by fire. It is estimated that the last fire from our men, which consumed the
						bushes, killed twenty men, and seriously wounded a hundred, who were burned to death.
						One hundred and twenty of the rebels were buried in one grave in the vicinity. The
						bodies of nearly all of them were burned to a crisp. Another glorious stand was made by
						the same regiment, in an open field, against a brigade and a battery of the enemy. They
						killed nearly all the horses of the battery, and being joined by two more regiments,
						forced the enemy to retreat. At two o'clock the regiment was fighting a largely superior
						force. General Hulbert, who had been closely watching the movements and efforts of the
						men, said to General Lauman: 'General, you will have to retire-- you cannot hold your
						position.' Says General Lauman: 'Did you ever see men fight so calmly and with so much
						effect before?' The answer was 'No.' 'Do you order me to retire?' 'No, you can do as you
						please; but you certainly cannot hold your position.' Then said General Lauman: 'I shall
						fight.' And he did fight, and maintained his position until after four o'clock, and till
						the last cartridge was fired." These points, gathered up by the correspondent at the
						time, were no exaggerations.</p>
					<p>When the brigade to which the Forty-fourth was attached was transferred from General
						Hulbert's division, he addressed Colonel Reed the following note:</p>

					<p>The two medical officers of the Regiment, and the musicians, served both days on the
						field, dressing the wounded and sending them at once to the boats at the Landing, whence
						they were transported down the river to Savannah, Paducah, and other points where
						general hospitals were located. There were several remarkable recoveries. Lieutenant
						Jacob Newman, mentioned in Colonel Reed's report as mortally wounded, was shot in the
						abdomen, in front, the ball lodging beneath the skin on the back, from where it was
						removed by Surgeon Martin, on the field. He was not expected to live to reach the
						Landing, but he is living today, though still a sufferer from the wound. John Nelson,
						Co. H, was shot through the right lung, and reported dead by his company officers at the
						time, but recovered, returned to the Regiment, served out his time, and then re-enlisted
						as a veteran. William Underwood, Co. D, was struck in the head with a minie-ball, which
						penetrated the skull, and he was left dead, as was <pb id="VAB1849-067" n="55"/>
						supposed, on the field. He was afterwards found alive, and unknown to his company, had
						been carried to a hospital boat. He finally recovered, though a vacant space in his
						forehead, like that in an infant's skull, was left. This soldier afterwards re-enlisted
						in the 129th Indiana, and died of a slight flesh wound received in the Atlanta
						campaign.</p>
					<p>The sick in camp at the opening of the battle were all hastily carried to the Landing
						by the nurses, as soon as they saw the Union lines were being pressed. The rebels had
						possession of the camp that night, but we enjoyed all the comfort it could afford the
						next night. The number of rounds fired by the different soldiers of the Regiment in this
						battle could not, of course, be accurately numbered; but William D. Groves, Co. H, a
						cool and intrepid soldier, and a man of good reputation, claimed that he fired 200
						rounds, 30 of which were with deliberate aim. His count for the second day was 77.</p>
					<p>The effect of the bravery of the soldiers had quite an inspiring influence on the
						Assistant Surgeon, judging by a letter to his wife, written a few days after the battle.
						He said:</p>
					<p>"I love the Forty-fourth (the fighting ones), and intend to follow them to the bitter
						end, if necessary. They richly merit the attention of surgeons, and shall have it as
						long as I can walk. I am sick, sick, of those puny, long-faced, sniveling, unfortunate
						mortals who are ever sick when there is a fight on hand. Fortunately we have had
						precious few of these. The more I study and learn what the Forty-fourth Regiment really
						did in this great battle, the more do I admire the <pb id="VAB1849-068" n="56"/>
						gallantry and bravery of the men. At one time they charged the enemy alone, and were the
						last troops to leave the field on the left wing, on Sunday. They marched off in good
						order, all alone, and far in the rear of the other forces, the enemy following closely
						behind in overwhelming numbers."</p>
					<p>He did serve the Regiment until the day of its muster out; and he is glad to-day,
						nearly eighteen years after, to make the record in this volume, that from that day on he
						never saw anything to change his profound regard for the valor and faithfulness of its
						men.</p>

					<p>The preceding is the official report of killed and wounded, as made to the Surgeon of
						the Regiment immediately after the battle, by the company officers. Several then
						reported killed were found afterward not to have been killed. In the company records
						will be found the killed as they appear in the Adjutant General's report. Joseph
						Jackman, M. J. Culp, Wm. H. Underwood, though reported killed, were severely wounded
						only, and recovered, and were discharged; whilst Henry Brenneman, Co. F, and Henry Ely,
						Co. <pb id="VAB1849-072" n="60"/> G, not reported killed, died a few days after the
						battle, of their wounds.</p>
					<p>Indiana soldiers, at this time, came to appreciate the care and devotion of Governor
						Morton as they never had before. As speedily as the boats could carry them he had extra
						physicians on the field, to help care for the sick and wounded; and by obtaining a
						special permit from the Secretary of War, hundreds of Indiana soldiers gained an
						opportunity to return home to recover from wounds and disease, who otherwise could not
						have had the privilege. Dr. George W. Carr, of Ligonier, and Dr. B. C. Rowan, of Fort
						Wayne, were sent by him to the Forty-fourth, to assist in the care of the sick and
						wounded. The latter remained a few days. Dr. Carr was detained until authority was given
						to appoint two assistant surgeons for each regiment, when he was regularly commissioned
						Second Assistant Surgeon of the Forty-fourth, and served it faithfully and efficiently
						until promoted Surgeon of the 129th Indiana.</p>
					<p>The conduct and merits of the battle were almost the exclusive topics of discussion for
						weeks. While resting up, officers and men of different commands visited each other, and
						compared their views and experiences. In the Forty-fourth there was but one opinion,
						apparently, and that was, that the troops in the front were surprised on the morning of
						the 6th, and that the surprise was the result of gross carelessness and an insufficient
						system of picketing. This view was confirmed by the new duties imposed upon the
						Regiment. Before the battle there had been no details for picket duty, but now they came
						frequently, and occasionally <pb id="VAB1849-073" n="61"/> the whole command was
						required to go out for that purpose. While out with the Regiment on picket duty, one
						day, we visited a rebel hospital within our lines, and conversed with a Captain of the
						11th Mississippi, who claimed that his regiment lost 298 men out of 400. In answer to
						the inquiry, "At what distance from our camp did you strike our pickets?" he answered,
						about 150 yards. He said they were greatly surprised at the easy and unmolested approach
						they made upon the Union lines.</p>
					<p>Those who witnessed the bravery of the Union soldiers on the first day at Shiloh, will
						ever remain confident that they could have whipped General Beauregard then and there had
						the front lines been protected as they were afterward, when in face of an enemy. These
						feelings on the part of the troops made the assumption of personal command by General
						Halleck quite agreeable. The enthusiasm for Grant subsided for a while, but only to be
						revived again, after Halleck had a brief day of favor, which closed with the siege of
						Corinth.</p>

					</head>

					<p>G<hi rend="sc">ENERAL</hi> H<hi rend="sc">ALLECK</hi> arrived at Pittsburgh Landing
						April 11th, and at once commenced reorganizing the army, and adding to its numbers,
						preparatory to a movement upon Corinth, twenty miles distant. The army was divided into
						five grand parts: the right, center, and left wings, the reserves, and the cavalry.
						General Thomas was assigned to the command of the right wing; General Buell, the center;
						General Pope, the left; General McClernand to the reserve, and General A. J. Smith to
						the cavalry. General Grant was assigned a nominal position as second in command. Each of
						the wings was composed of four divisions. To General Buell was assigned the divisions of
						Generals McCook, Nelson, Crittenden, and Wood. The Forty-fourth was assigned to General
						Crittenden's division, and to the brigade commanded by General Vancleve.</p>
					<p>On the 29th of April the order came to strike tents, and the great movement on Corinth
						commenced. For the next thirty days, we thought we were being handled with great care
						and skill, though towards the last it became apparent, with excessive caution. We were
						marched out the first day one mile and a quarter, the next day one mile and a half, and
						thus we moved <pb id="VAB1849-075" n="63"/> every few days, to the right, or left, or
						forward, occasionally skirmishing with the enemy, until we reached Farmington, near
						Corinth. Here we halted long enough to form camp, but with continuous picket firing
						along the line in our immediate front, which broke out occasionally into sharp
						skirmishes. Early on the morning of the 30th of May, the brigade was called out, as
						though for battle, when terrific sounds, as of explosions, were heard in the direction
						of Corinth. The division advanced, and without opposition marched directly into Corinth,
						finding it evacuated, and a large amount of army stores on fire. The thundering sounds
						heard before starting were the explosions of a large pile of shells the enemy had fired,
						being unable to get them away. Thus ended the siege of Corinth. The Forty fourth lost no
						men in the movement, except such as died of disease on the march. These were:</p>
					<p>Jacob Coldren, Co. H, May 8th; James A. Dirrim, Co. F, May 21st; Elijah Locke, Co. K,
						June --; Henry Crafts, Co. H, June 9th, and John T. Johnson, Co. --, June 11th,--the two
						latter at the general field hospital.</p>
					<p>General Crittenden's division pursued the enemy south as far as Booneville,
						Mississippi, some twenty miles, when further pursuit was abandoned, and the great
						combination of armies under General Halleck was broken up. The army of the Ohio, with
						General Buell in command, was ordered to face to the east, and move on Chattanooga, two
						hundred miles distant, while the army of the Tennessee, under General Grant, was to
						operate west of Corinth.</p>



					<pb id="VAB1849-076" n="64"/>


					<p>General Crittenden's division started eastward from Booneville, June 4th. When the
						Regiment reached Iuka, the writer, who had fallen sick, was left, and John R. Grubb,
						musician, also in ill health, was detailed to care for him. A furlough was sent in a few
						days, and they managed to get to the river, and thence home. I am therefore without
						personal knowledge of the march from this point to Florence, Tuscumbia, Athens,
						Huntsville, Stevenson, and finally to Battle Creek, Tennessee, which the command reached
						about the middle of July. The march was much complained of by the soldiers on account of
						the lack of full rations, and of insufficient clothing. The last part of the journey was
						performed by many barefooted. There was no action with the enemy on the march. Two
						soldiers who fell sick on the route and were left at general hospital at Huntsville,
						Alabama, died, viz.: John Monkey, Co. G, July 5th, and Joseph Eckles, Co. D, July
						12th.</p>
					<p>The writer reached the command again, July 26th, and found it very pleasantly encamped
						about five miles above Bridgeport, in a narrow valley, with the Tennessee River in
						front, the Cumberland range in the rear, and Battle Creek on the left. Generals
						Crittenden's and McCook's divisions were scattered along the line from Stevenson,
						Alabama, to this point. We were now at the extreme front, with the enemy's pickets in
						full view across the river. Chattanooga, about thirty miles distant, was the objective
						point of General Buell, but he now found his forces scattered all along the railroad
						lines in Northern Alabama and Middle Tennessee, trying to keep communication open to
						Bridgeport, and yet <pb id="VAB1849-077" n="65"/> was unable to keep these two divisions
						in full rations or forage.</p>
					<p>Soon after reaching Battle Creek, the Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel each being absent,
						the command of the Regiment devolved upon Major Bingham. August 18th, 1862, was grand
						muster day, under the noted Order No. 14, according to which the muster rolls were to be
						revised, and all found absent without leave were to be stricken off. The order was the
						occasion of much trouble, and in many instances of great injustice. Many who had no
						thought of deserting, nor in the least proving recreant to their duty, were unavoidably
						detained away longer than their leaves allowed. It was only through the decision of a
						court martial that any could be restored to their positions in the army. And the
						subsequent movements of the army prevented the convening of these courts for several
						months. Several officers and a number of men of the Regiment had trouble under the
						order. At this muster there were 437 men and 26 commissioned officers present, and 200
						men and four officers absent. The loss by death, discharge and desertion up to this date
						was 272. The deaths had been 80. The killed and wounded numbered 250.</p>
					<p>It was now apparent that another movement was approaching. The sick were all ordered
						back to Stevenson, and the command put in readiness for motion. What the movement would
						be was a matter of much speculation in regimental quarters, but without knowledge.
						Subsequent history reveals the fact that General Buell and General Thomas differed as to
						the intent of <pb id="VAB1849-078" n="66"/> the rebel General Bragg, then at
						Chattanooga. Buell thought it was his intention to strike for Nashville, whilst Thomas
						believed that his objective point was Kentucky and Louisville. Thomas was right, but the
						movements of the army of the Ohio were conducted for some thirty days upon Buell's
						theory.</p>
					<p>Before we depart, let us count the little mounds that cover the remains of the heroes
						who have departed this life in camp here. They were:</p>

					<p>August 23, marched westward about two miles, and bivouacked in Gizzard Cove.</p>
					<p>August 24, moved slowly westward five miles, to foot of Cumberland mountains. General

						better health than when they left camp at Battle Creek. But they felt that their loyalty
						to the commanding General had been very severely tested, and, with a few, their loyalty
						to the Government. The whole retrograde movement, it seemed to them, could have been
						avoided; and that engagements with the enemy which would have cut the movement short had
						been purposely avoided by General Buell, was the firm belief of thousands of men in the
						army of the Ohio, and throughout the country.</p>

					</head>

					<p>A <hi rend="sc">FEW</hi> days' rest only was given at Louisville, but in these few days
						General Buell's army was reorganized, partially re-clothed, and a large number of new
						regiments added. General Crittenden was now assigned to the command of one of the three
						corps newly formed, and General Vancleve to the command of a division. The second
						brigade, under the latter, consisted of the 11th Kentucky, 13th Ohio, 44th Indiana, and
						86th Indiana, a new regiment; Colonel Hawkins, of the 11th Kentucky, in command.</p>
					<p>General Bragg was reported at Bardstown, some twenty-five miles southeast, and on
						October 1st, Buell's army moved again to meet him, but hardly a soldier in the ranks
						believed a hostile meeting at all probable. On the second day out, the Regiment was
						greeted with the presence of a paymaster, for the first time since June. That night two
						Lieutenants and some ten men deserted. Their dishonored names can be found in the report
						of the Adjutant General of the State. We omit them here.</p>
					<p>Vancleve's division reached the vicinity of Bardstown on the 4th. There was more or
						less skirmishing at the front every day, but only with the rear-guard of <pb
							id="VAB1849-084" n="72"/> the enemy, who had fallen back to Springfield, and then to
						Perryville. General Crittenden reached the vicinity of Perryville about noon, October
						8th, and formed his corps in line of battle on the right. The roar of battle was
						distinctly heard to the left, and riderless horses rushed through the lines of the
						Forty-fourth; but there were no orders to advance until the 9th, when the corps moved in
						fine line of battle, through wood and field, on Perryville. The Surgeons of the
						Regiment, getting weary of the slow pace, and the whole farce, rode ahead into
						Perryville, which had been abandoned by the enemy the night before, and was then
						occupied by troops from the left. To the men in line it seemed a crime that General
						Crittenden was not ordered forward on the 8th. Such a movement would have resulted in a
						most crushing defeat of Bragg's army, if not in its capture.</p>
					<p>General Crittenden's corps manœuvred around in the triangle between Perryville,
						Harrodsburg and Danville, a portion of the time in line of battle, until the 13th when
						pursuit of Bragg was commenced, and we were marched to Danville, Stanford, Crab Orchard,
						Mt. Vernon, and thence into a mountainous section to Wild Cat, where we lay in bivouac
						from the 20th until the 23d, when we were marched back to Mt. Vernon, and thence
						southward to Somerset, where we arrived on the 25th, in the midst of a snow-storm. Snow
						fell that night to the depth of some four or five inches. The command was wholly without
						shelter, and the men had only a blanket apiece. Large fires were built, and taunting
						jibes, and the current army slang, "Here's <pb id="VAB1849-085" n="73"/> your mule,"
						resounded from the camp fires all night long. After a halt of a day or two here, we
						marched on, moving through the Mill Spring battle-field to the vicinity of Glasgow,
						which was reached October 3d. Here the command was gladdened with the news that General
						Buell had been relieved and General Rosencrans placed in command of the army of the
						Ohio, which name he soon had changed to that of the army of the Cumberland.</p>
					<p>As the Regiment went into bivouac one evening while on the march from Somerset, the
						attention of the medical officers was called to Paul Bean, Co. G, who was found lying
						prostrate on the ground, but presenting no indications whatever of any disease. To all
						appearance he was utterly exhausted, and this alone. Stimulants and tonics were
						administered, but being still unable to be carried the next morning, he was left in the
						care of a friendly family, where he died a day or two after. He fell a martyr to his
						abhorrence of the shirk, and of that class who for every trivial ailment sought medical
						aid, excuse from duty, or a ride in the ambulances or wagons. He would ask no favors,
						and literally fell in the ranks before his disability was known by the company
						officers.</p>

					</head>

					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> Army of the Cumberland was now faced toward Nashville, and
						General Crittenden, with two of his divisions--Vancleve's and Wood's--started on the
						5th, marched through Scottville, reaching Gallatin, Tennessee, where they drove the
						rebel cavalry, on the 9th, making a distance of sixty-three miles in four days. The next
						day the command marched out on the Lebanon road, to the crossing of the Nashville and
						Lebanon pike, when it turned eastward toward Nashville three miles, and went into camp
						six miles from General Jackson's Hermitage. Here the great marches of 1862 ended. The
						Regiment had marched, since leaving Louisville, about three hundred and sixty miles, in
						forty days, and with only six days' rest by the way. Since leaving Battle Creek, August
						20, the distance traveled was nearly seven hundred miles. All this time the men were
						without shelter of any kind, carried but one blanket apiece, and were nearly all the
						time on half rations, and very poorly shod.</p>
					<p>There was a rest here until the 18th, when Colonel Hawkins's brigade was ordered to
						move south about eight miles, to Rural Hill. The enemy was reported in the vicinity, but
						the camp was not disturbed until early <pb id="VAB1849-087" n="73"/> dawn on the 18th,
						when a dash was made upon the camp. But the men were quickly in line, and the rebels
						withdrew, leaving six dead on the field. No losses resulted in the Regiment, and we
						believe there were none in the brigade. The next day the brigade moved back to the
						Lebanon pike, and went into camp on Mill Creek, near the Hermitage. On the 30th of
						November the division was moved up to Nashville, and across on to the Nashville and
						Murfreesboro pike, and went into camp near the Tennessee Insane Asylum. Here the
						Regiment prepared for winter quarters.</p>
					<p>Important changes occurred in the Regiment on the first of December. Colonel Reed's
						resignation, tendered a few days previous, was accepted. The Regiment was called into
						line, just before his departure; the flag carried up to this time, and which had been
						presented the command on the day it set out for the field, by Mayor Randall, on behalf
						of the ladies of Fort Wayne, was planted in front. Sadly torn and tattered by shot and
						shell at Donelson and Shiloh, it attested the fidelity of the Colonel and his brave men
						in maintaining the pledge given when it was first presented, "to honor, sustain, and
						defend it unto death." At Shiloh, when all its brave bearers were stricken down, he
						gathered it up with his own hands and carried it unfurled and unsullied from the field.
						The old flag was held as a precious emblem by the men, but as he who had led them in its
						honor and defense was now about to depart, to be associated again with its donors, the
						Regiment thought it appropriate, as a token of their appreciation of his gallant
						services, to present him the <pb id="VAB1849-088" n="76"/> flag. A more significant and
						touching testimonial could hardly be given a brave man. The Colonel, deeply moved,
						responded in a few remarks, highly complimenting the men and officers for their bravery
						and fidelity. He then presented the Regiment a new flag, purchased at his own expense,
						trusting it would be honored as the old one had been. And it was. The old flag is yet
						sacredly preserved by the Colonel, at his home in New Jersey. The Colonel also carried
						with him testimonials of regard from all the officers of the brigade.</p>
					<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Stoughton, who had been promoted to Colonel of the 100th Indiana
						Infantry, and Chaplain Beeks, resigned, also departed about the same time.</p>
					<p>After these officers left, the commissioned company officers met and held an informal
						election for Lieutenant-Colonel and Major, choosing Captain William C. Williams, Co. G,
						Lieutenant-Colonel, and Captain Charles F. Kinney. Co. A, Major. The companies also met
						and made recommendations for all official vacancies in their respective companies.
						Captain Kinney being the senior captain of the Regiment, and feeling aggrieved at the
						choice that had been made, tendered his resignation, and obtaining leave of absence,
						departed for home.</p>
					<p>On the 2d, General Rosecrans reviewed his army, making a very favorable impression on
						the minds of the men. As he passed along the line of the Forty-fourth, he made some
						quite flattering comments upon the healthy and hearty appearance of the men. Noticing
							<pb id="VAB1849-089" n="77"/> a man not completely equipped, he chided him pleasantly,
						remarking, "that when men are soldiers they must act as soldiers, and when they keep
						grocery, tend the grocery."</p>
					<p>While in camp here, forage for the army was mainly obtained by foraging expeditions,
						and the Regiment was out on several occasions, some of which were attended with
						skirmishes with the enemy. On the 11th the brigade camp was moved back two miles, to
						within five miles of Nashville.</p>
					<p>Commissions were received on the 13th, making Captain Williams, Co. G, Colonel; Captain
						S. C. Aldrich, Co. K, Lieutenant-Colonel, and Captain Kinney, Co. A, Major. The latter
						declined to muster, and his resignation was accepted. The brigade was also reorganized
						on the 15th, and was made to include, besides the Forty-fourth, Colonel W. C. Williams,
						the 86th Indiana, Colonel A. S. Hamilton; 13th Ohio, Colonel J. G. Hawkins; 59th Ohio,
						Colonel J. P. Fyffe; 7th Indiana Battery, Captain G. R. Swallow. Colonel Fyffe was
						assigned to the command of the brigade.</p>
					<p>The sick were now ordered to Nashville, and the command held in readiness for momentary
						orders to move on Murfreesboro.</p>

					</head>

					<p>G<hi rend="sc">ENERAL</hi> C<hi rend="sc">RITTENDEN</hi> moved his corps, consisting of
						Wood's, Palmer's, and Vancleve's divisions, on the 26th, advancing on the Murfreesboro
						pike, Palmer's division in the advance. There was considerable skirmishing during the
						day, and General Vancleve went into bivouac in the vicinity of Lavergne that evening,
						with the enemy apparently in force in the town. The next morning, there was a sharp
						skirmish in the village, during which it was almost wholly consumed by fire. General
						Vancleve moved through the place and then filed off to the left, some three miles, and
						bivouacked on Stuart's Creek, where we remained over Sunday.</p>
					<p>On Monday, the 29th, we advanced again towards Murfreesboro, and went into bivouac in
						the rear of Generals Wood's and Palmer's divisions, who were in line of battle in front
						of the enemy. General Rosecrans came up the next day, the 30th, and established his
						headquarters a few paces in front of our brigade. During the day other divisions came up
						and took position. General Crittenden's corps was formed on the left of the Murfreesboro
						and Nashville pike, with orders to cross Stone River the next morning, and move into
						Murfreesboro. General Vancleve's division was to cross <pb id="VAB1849-091" n="79"/> at
						the lower ford and advance against the rebel General Breckenridge. General Wood was to
						support him on the right, crossing at the upper ford, and General Palmer was to engage
						the enemy in his front. Next, in the centre, was Thomas's corps, and on the right was
						McCook's corps. General Rosecrans' plan of battle was to open on the left, and extend
						the engagement from left to right.</p>
					<p>Early on the morning of the 31st, General Vancleve initiated the execution of this plan
						by moving his division towards the left. The advance brigade was crossing the river, and
						Colonel Fyffe had just reached the banks of the river, when the movement was arrested by
						an order for Fyffe to face his brigade about, and march with all possible speed to
						resist an attack of the enemy's cavalry on the trains in the rear, on the Nashville
						pike, and about one mile in the rear of the point left in the morning. The enemy had
						wholly disconcerted the plans of General Rosecrans by a furious onslaught on the extreme
						right about sunrise, driving back the whole right wing to a right-angle with the centre.
						Colonel Fyffe reached the point of attack on the trains, but the Union cavalry had
						already succeeded in repulsing the attack, and in recapturing the trains. The brigade
						was then ordered to the support of the right, and returning on the pike about half a
						mile, marched through a cedar wood to an open field. The enemy filled the wood beyond,
						and also a wood on the right of the field. The brigade advanced across the field, and by
						some blunder moved far beyond the supporting columns on the right and left. As soon as
						the men were across the field, the <pb id="VAB1849-092" n="80"/> enemy opened a terrific
						fire from the front and right. The place was too hot, and the brigade would have been
						annihilated in a few minutes had it not fallen back, which it did speedily but in order.
						The lines were again formed near the Nashville pike, and held during the remainder of
						the day and night. The day was a terrible one. Many brigades and regiments on the right
						were broken up and scattered, and wandered from place to place, officers in search of
						their men, and men in search of their officers, until they were gathered up without
						regard to former organization, and placed in line of action. There was no place of
						safety within the Union lines. The Surgeons of the Forty-fourth dressed the wounded at
						times during the day when the balls whizzed about from the four points of the
						compass.</p>
					<p>General Rosecrans re-formed his lines in the darkness of the night of the 31st, and the
						next morning Vancleve moved his division across Stone River to the point started for the
						morning before. Colonel Fyffe's brigade was placed some forty rods in front of the
						river, in face of the enemy, where the Forty-fourth remained all the day of January 1st,
						1863, without engagement except picket firing. The morning of the second was opened with
						a lively artillery duel of about an hour's duration, and sharp skirmishing was continued
						along the whole line until about 2 o'clock <hi rend="sc">P</hi>. <hi rend="sc">M</hi>.,
						when the enemy under General Breckenridge advanced in heavy storming columns. The two
						brigades in front, General Beatty's and Colonel Fyffe's, were forced back to the river,
						where they were met by supporting columns. A massed battery <pb id="VAB1849-093" n="81"
						/> of some fifty-eight pieces, that had been collected in anticipation of such a
						movement, now opened on the enemy. A battle scene ensued that hardly had a parallel
						during the war. More musketry and artillery firing, probably, occurred in a like number
						of minutes on longer lines, but not so much on so short a line. The earth trembled under
						the shock, and it was reported that window-glass was broken by the concussion of the air
						two miles distant. The noise could hardly have been exceeded by the concentration of
						several thunder storms. General Breckenridge's columns melted away, and he fled back
						with their remnants, and the Forty-fourth planted its colors on the enemy's breastworks,
						and slept that night on the field of battle.</p>
					<p>The enemy evacuated Murfreesboro that night and the next day, and General Rosecrans
						entered the day after.</p>
					<p>I have been unable to find any official report of the part performed by the
						Forty-fourth at the battle of Stone River, and owing to the capture of Colonel Williams,
						in command, during the furious charge of the enemy, it is probable that none was made.
						Having been an eye-witness of nearly all its movements, I can testify as to its
						honorable conduct. Though the brigade was twice repulsed, it was under circumstances
						that reflected no discredit. An attempt to hold its position in either case would have
						been utter annihilation. The columns were in each case readily rallied, with the loss of
						very few stragglers. Lieutenant Dancer, of Co. H, Inspector General on Colonel Fyffe's
						staff, conducted himself bravely, and was severely wounded. Sergeant <pb
							id="VAB1849-094" n="82"/> Gordon relates that during the repulse on the left, Captain
						Cosper, Co. F, was closely pursued by a rebel, who repeatedly ordered him to halt and
						surrender, or he would shoot. Not heeding the demand, the rebel fired, wounding Cosper
						in the hand. At that he turned upon his adversary and thrust him through with his
						bayonet, killing him on the spot. He then continued his retreat.</p>
					<p>The Regiment went into action with about 300 men, and lost 8 killed, 52 wounded, and 25
						missing. Following are the names, as given in the official report of Surgeon Martin:</p>

						<hi rend="center sc">MURFREESBORO.</hi>
					</head>

					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> Army of the Cumberland moved into Murfreesboro, and went into
						camp in the vicinity, January 5th, 1863, General Crittenden's corps taking position on
						the left along the Lebanon pike. The Forty-fourth was located about one mile out, in the
						vicinity of the Spence mansion, which was assigned to Surgeon Martin for hospital
						purposes. The house was a commodious brick residence, richly furnished when abandoned by
						the owner during the evacuation. The Regiment passed the beautiful place in its
						northward march in September previous, and the lady of the house tauntingly asked some
						of the boys who called, "Why are you going north?" The sick boys, as they came in, were
						now glad she had gone south. The proprietor, we believe, was a rebel General.</p>
					<p>Assistant Surgeons Rerick and Carr were detailed for work in the general field hospital
						in the rear of the battle-field. The former worked there about two weeks, when he was
						taken severely sick, and was brought to the Spence house, where he lay until about the
						middle of February, when he was granted leave of absence and sent home in charge of a
						nurse, with little expectation of ever being able to return. But he did return, in <pb
							id="VAB1849-098" n="86"/> April. Dr. Carr remained at the field hospital several
						weeks, and then returned and took medical charge of the Regiment in camp.</p>
					<p>During the six months' encampment at Murfreesboro the Regiment was comfortably located.
						It had excellent hospital quarters, and the men no harder duties than work on the
						fortifications being erected. This period, though, was in one respect the darkest of the
						war, especially to Indiana soldiers. The results in the field were far from being
						satisfactory, and at home there was much opposition to all the vigorous measures
						proposed for the prosecution of the contest. The formation of secret organizations to
						oppose the prosecution of the war were reported, and desertions from the army were
						encouraged. A formidable conspiracy, known as the Knights of the Golden Circle, with
						headquarters in Indiana, created much alarm, not only in the public mind of the North,
						but in the army at the front. The Legislature that convened on the first of January,
						1863, was believed to be largely under its control, an open and startling effort being
						made to deprive Governor Morton of his constitutional right of Commander-in-Chief of the
						State Militia. The Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln had just gone into
						effect, and the prejudices of the people, both at home and in the army, against the
						colored race, were being actively aroused. The great theme of the real sympathizers with
						the rebellion was, that the war was being prosecuted, not to restore the Union, but to
						liberate the slaves. The soldiers had all enlisted to maintain the integrity of the
						Union, and any deviation of the <pb id="VAB1849-099" n="87"/> Administration from this
						purpose would be productive of great if not fatal disaffection in the ranks. The enemy
						and his sympathizers at the North well understood this, and hence the strenuous efforts,
						secretly and openly, to make such a deviation apparent. The soldiers, though, had no
						sympathy for the rebel. They were anxious for his overthrow by the most speedy and
						efficient means. Though they had enlisted only to restore the Union, and not to liberate
						a race, they were not unwilling to deprive the enemy in their front of the assistance of
						that race. The mass of them looked upon the Proclamation in its true light, as a
						military necessity, a measure needful for the overthrow of the rebellion. Thousands,
						though, while recognizing it as a military necessity, saw in that necessity an
						overruling Providence leading men who attempted one good act, to do another and possibly
						a greater than they had originally intended. Good begets good, and evil begets evil. The
						sin of slavery begot rebellion. The love of Union begot opposition to rebellion, and the
						liberation of an oppressed race. Slavery did not intend rebellion at first, neither did
						the love of Union, emancipation. The sequences in both cases were natural, and probably
						inevitable.</p>
					<p>During the first months of 1863 these questions were much discussed in army circles, as
						well as throughout the North. The Indiana soldiers were generally indignant at the
						hostility to Governor Morton, and at the manifest sympathy in many parts of the State
						for the enemy. Memorials and resolutions were considered and adopted by regiments, and
						sent to the State authorities, expressing the sentiments of the soldiers. A <pb
							id="VAB1849-100" n="88"/> memorial to the Legislature was read to the Forty-fourth, as
						well as to a number of other regiments, and by a vote of the Regiment was unanimously
						adopted. This memorial closed with a proposal that the Legislature adopt the following
						resolutions as a basis of all their acts: <list type="ordered">
							<item n="1.">"<hi rend="i">Resolved:</hi> That we are unconditionally and determinedly

					<p>These resolutions fairly expressed the sentiments of the soldiers. They were presented

						armistice." The memorial, with the resolutions, were rejected by a vote of 28 to 18; but
						a petition from rebel-sympathizing citizens, denouncing the war as an "infernal
						abolition war," and asking "that not one man nor one dollar be voted to prosecute it,"
						was deemed sufficiently appropriate to refer kindly to a committee.</p>
					<p>Such was the contrast between the sentiments of the soldiers in the field, the Indiana

					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> Army of the Cumberland commenced another movement against
						General Bragg, June 23d, 1862, and by the next day all the divisions, except General
						Vancleve's, were under motion. The latter was moved into the fortifications for a few
						days, but set out for the front on the 4th of July, moving on the McMinnville road by
						way of Woodbury. The division reached McMinnville on the 7th, and went into camp. The
						Forty-fourth was pleasantly camped near the residence of a Mrs. Stubblefield.</p>
					<p>On the night of the 10th, after the men had retired, the news came of the fall of
						Vicksburg and of the defeat of General Lee at Gettysburg. As the word passed around from
						tent to tent, the men jumped up and rushed out, and gave cheer after cheer. They thought
						surely the war was then nearly at an end.</p>
					<p>Colonel Williams, who, after his capture at Stone River, had been carried to Libby
						prison, and after some months' confinement there, had been exchanged, reached his
						command again on the evening of the 16th, and some ten days thereafter resigned. Surgeon
						Martin also resigned at the same time, on account of disability. <pb id="VAB1849-103"
							n="91"/> The only commissioned officer now left of the original Field and Staff, was
						the writer.</p>
					<p>While in camp here, details from the Regiment went out on several raids in the vicinity
						in pursuit of bushwhackers, escorted trains over the mountains to Dunlap, guarded
						railroad trains to Tullahoma, and worked on fortifications which were commenced near the
						depot.</p>
					<p>On September 3d the division broke camp and started for the front, crossed the
						Cumberland Mountains to Dunlap, thence down the Sequatcha Valley to Jasper and Battle
						Creek, passing by the old camp left about a year before, to Bridgeport, where we crossed
						the Tennessee River, moved up the river road to Shell Mound, thence around the Point of
						Lookout Mountain in full view of Chattanooga, which had been evacuated a day or two
						before. We bivouacked that night at Rossville, and here rejoined the rest of General
						Crittenden's corps.</p>
					<p>The march from McMinnville to this point, a distance of one hundred and thirty miles,
						had been made in eight days, which, considering the passage over the mountains, was
						considered pretty hard service. The next day, the 11th, Crittenden moved to Ringgold,
						and Vancleve's division was advanced some two miles south of this place. That night the
						body of the rebel army lay between General Crittenden and the remainder of the Army of
						the Cumberland, slumbering in the mountains twenty and forty miles distant. It was a
						golden opportunity for General Bragg, but he appeared not to know it. The next morning
						the division was withdrawn to Ringgold, and the whole corps marched westward twelve
						miles to Lee and Gordon's Mills, reaching <pb id="VAB1849-104" n="92"/> out towards
						Thomas. On the 13th, Vancleve's division crossed the Chickamauga at the Mills and
						advanced on the Lafayette road to John Henderson's plantation, where a sharp skirmish
						ensued, the rebels shelling the whole line. The division was withdrawn about four
						o'clock <hi rend="sc">P</hi>. <hi rend="sc">M</hi>., and bivouacked near the Mills that
						night. Crittenden was here still exposed to the whole rebel army. The danger evidently
						becoming apparent, he moved the next day further to the west and in the direction of
						General Thomas, and that night rested in the Chattanooga valley on the east side of the
						Lookout range. Here connection was made with Thomas's corps, or a part of it, and
						Crittenden moved back the next day, the 15th, to Crawfish Springs, in the vicinity of
						Lee and Gordon's Mills. The command was held here, on the 16th and 17th, in momentary
						readiness for action. The great clouds of dust that could be seen across the Chickamauga
						to the east, and which were veering around to the north, showed the enemy in motion for
						our rear and for Chattanooga. With the exception of the cavalry, our division was then
						at the extreme left. McCook's corps was still in the mountains somewhere, struggling
						through. Late in the afternoon of the 18th, two regiments of Colonel Fyffe's brigade
						were hastily ordered to the support of General Wilder, who faced the enemy at a crossing
						of the Chickamauga, a mile or two north of Lee and Gordon's Mills.</p>
					<p>For the part performed by the Forty-fourth on the bloody field of Chickamauga, we
						subjoin the official report of Lieutenant-Colonel Aldrich, the brave and intrepid
						officer in command.</p>

									<salute>Colonel Dick, comd'g 2d Brig., 3d Div., 21st Army Corps:</salute>
									<p>In compliance with orders, I herewith submit a report of the part my Regiment
										took in the series of battles near this point. On the 18th my Regiment and the
										59th Ohio were ordered three miles to the left of our camp at Crawfish Springs,
										to the support of Colonel Wilder. We reached the point and formed line of
										battle, in the after part of the day, in a wood in front of an open field. Here
										our cavalry were driven in a little after dark. I kept my line, expecting to see
										the enemy's cavalry approach, but not showing themselves, and being left alone
										(the 59th having fallen back), you ordered me to fall back to a new line that
										was forming in the field. Here we remained until near daylight the next morning.
										When our division came up, we were, with them, ordered still further to the left
										in line of battle, when we engaged the enemy, in large force, my Regiment and
										the 59th Ohio in front, 86th Indiana and 13th Ohio in second line. We had a very
										severe fight, contesting the ground inch by inch. The 59th, on our right, gave
										way, also the second line behind, leaving us alone to contend with a powerful
										force of the enemy without any support on our right. In this condition we fought
										the enemy as best we could for some time, until discovering that the left had
										also fallen back. I then ordered a slow retreat, fighting our way back to a
										small hollow, where I rallied my Regiment again, brought it about face and
										advanced a short distance and poured a destructive fire into the enemy. Again we
										were driven back to the ravine, again rallied, and again obliged to leave the
										field. This we did in tolerably good order, joining the remainder of our brigade
										on the hill in rear of the battle ground. These are the main points of the <pb
											id="VAB1849-106" n="94"/> part performed by the Regiment in the engagement on
										Saturday, the 19th.</p>
									<p>Sunday morning, after drawing rations (which part of the Regiment did not have
										time to do), we were ordered to the front again, to double column on the centre,
										and proceed by flank and forward movements until we reached a point near where
										the battle was raging. We advanced along a low piece of ground, making a
										distance to the left, where we made a short halt, deployed column, and waited
										the enemy's approach. A regiment engaged in the front fell back suddenly in a
										shattered condition, and caused a panic with most of our brigade. I succeeded in
										holding most of my men, and fought the enemy against great odds. At this point
										my horse was shot. We held them in check some time, but on their breaking around
										our left, I ordered a retreat, and in good order went in search of our brigade.
										On our march to the rear, we heard, to our then left, quite heavy firing, and
										directed our march to that point. Found it to be General Wood's command
										contesting the holding of a hill, a very important point. We arrived very
										opportunely, and took position with Colonel Harker's brigade, placing our flag
										on the brow of the hill. Our men nobly rallied and fought like veterans indeed,
										and assisted in repulsing the enemy three times and effectually, the enemy
										abandoning the ground. Here Captain Gunsenhouser and George Wilson fell. I must
										say I never saw troops handled better, and fight more desperately, than did
										Colonel Harker's brigade. We remained here until after dark, some time after the
										firing ceased, until the army fell back, when we proceeded to the rear, reaching
										Rossville about ten or eleven o'clock at night. On hearing that General Vancleve
										was near the forks of the roads, we moved in the morning of the 21st to find him
										and our brigade. I had found some of the 13th Ohio, of whom I took <pb
											id="VAB1849-107" n="95"/> command the night before, and also collected from
										different regiments a considerable number by the time we reached the spring near
										the Chattanooga road, where we received orders from Captain Otis, General
										Vancleve's adjutant, to march to town. This we did, being the last of any amount
										of our brigade to take that place. Soon after reaching town I was ordered by you
										to take my Regiment and the 13th Ohio and proceed to Missionary Ridge. This I
										did, and threw up a breastwork to the right of the road across the top of the
										ridge. I also placed the 13th Ohio in a very commanding position one half mile
										to the right. We were supported by Colonel Harrison's mounted infantry. On the
										22d, about 10 o'clock <hi rend="sc">A</hi>. <hi rend="sc">M</hi>., our videttes
										exchanged shots with the enemy's advance, who were driven back by Colonel
										Harrison's men. Between 11 and 12 o'clock the enemy advanced again, drove in the
										pickets and appeared in force. I reserved my fire until two lines appeared, and,
										being completely covered, took them by surprise when I ordered my men to rise
										and fire. The distance being short, and the enemy in fair view, we made terrible
										havoc among them. They fell back, came up again, and were met again by another
										volley. At this juncture they sent a force to our left to try to dislodge us,
										but we met them with such a shower of bullets, they did not succeed. In this way
										we fought them until Colonel Harrison informed me by one of his aids that they
										were coming down the Ridge upon our right and left, with the probability of
										cutting us off. I then ordered a retreat, and threw out skirmishers in my rear,
										and fell back in perfect order to the railroad. This ended the most important
										events. It would take a volume to give full particulars.</p>
									<p>I must say for my men and officers that I never saw men fight better or more
										bravely, or keep together so <pb id="VAB1849-108" n="96"/> well. Captain
										Gunsenhouser, Co. F, fell nobly and bravely fighting. No braver man ever fought.
										His life has been laid on the altar of his country. His example in the Regiment
										has ever been one worthy of imitation. Adjutant Hodges nobly assisted me in the
										management of the Regiment. Captain Curtiss deserves especial notice. He fought
										like a hero. Captains Wilson, Burch, King, Hildebrand, Grund and Getty did
										nobly. Lieutenants of the several companies did exceedingly well, with but few
										exceptions. The ever faithful Surgeon Rerick followed us from point to point,
										assisted by Dr. Carr; and I am pleased to say that no regiment has had better
										care for their wounded than the 44th Indiana, in this army. He succeeded also in
										getting all of our wounded from the hospital which was captured on Sunday
										evening by the enemy. All my men, with very few exceptions, deserve great
										praise, and earned additional honor and glory. Our casualties are as follows:
										Killed, 3; wounded, 59; missing, 10. Those missing I think are wounded. Attached
										you will find a list of killed and wounded, with name, rank, and company, nature
										of wound, etc. All honor to the noble dead and wounded. I cannot restrain my
										feelings in view of their sufferings and noble deeds.</p>

					<p>Colonel Harker, in his official report, made honorable mention of the Regiment for its
						gallant aid of his command in the critical moment referred to by Lieutenant-Colonel
						Aldrich. Also did Generals Crittenden, Vancleve, and Wood. We regret that we have not
						their official reports at hand. General Thomas also <pb id="VAB1849-109" n="[]"/>

							<p rend="center">SIMEON C. ALDRICH,<lb/> LIEUT. COLONEL.</p>
						</figure>
						<pb id="VAB1849-110" n="[]"/>
						<pb id="VAB1849-111" n="97"/> complimented the Lieutenant-Colonel in person. Van Horne,
						in his history of the Army of the Cumberland, in describing the battle after the enemy
						had broken through the Union lines (Vol. I, page 343), says: "For a time after the
						disaster on the right, there were but few divisions in line against the whole rebel
						army. These divisions were all firm, but the enemy was concentrating on both flanks of
						the line which lay across the Lafayette and Chattanooga roads. And as soon, under the
						inspiration of partial victory and the hope of complete triumph, most vigorous and
						persistent assaults were made, whose successful resistance under the circumstances makes
						the closing struggle of this great battle one of the most remarkable which has occurred
						in modern times--one of the grandest which has ever been made for the existence of army
						or country. From noon till night the five divisions which had previously constituted
						'Thomas's line,' and such other troops as reached him from the right, under orders, or
						drifted to him after the disaster, and two brigades from the reserve corps, successfully
						resisted the whole confederate army. * * * The 44th Indiana from Dick's brigade, and the
						17th Kentucky from Beatty's brigade, of Vancleve's division, were the only regiments
						that, without orders, diverged from the line of retreat, and reached General Thomas in
						time to participate in the final conflict."</p>
					<p>And again, describing more particularly the struggle on the hill when the Forty-fourth
						assisted Harker's brigade of Wood's division, Van Horne says (Vol. I, page 352), after
						referring to the posting of the troops by General Thomas in person: "There was scarcely
						time <pb id="VAB1849-112" n="98"/> for the execution of these movements before the left
						wing of the confederate army fell upon Wood and Brannan. It is impossible to compute
						with accuracy the number of troops with these Generals. Portions of their respective
						divisions had been previously severed and lost, and there were troops with them
						representing at least two divisions. General Beatty, of Negley's division, was acting as
						a fragmentary force, and a large portion of Stanley's brigade, Colonel Stoughton
						commanding, Colonel Stanley having been wounded, the 21st Ohio regiment from Sirwell's
						brigade, of the same division, and the 17th Kentucky, Colonel Stout, and the 44th
						Indiana, Lieutenant-Colonel Aldrich, from Vancleve's division. But this isolated line
						composed of fragments of brigades and regiments, about four thousand men in all,
						repeatedly repulsed the most furious attacks of Longstreet's massive lines."</p>
					<p>The report of Lieutenant-Colonel Aldrich might seem somewhat colored to some, but the
						above facts obtained by Chaplain Van Horne from official reports of his superior
						officers, fully vindicate the Colonel's plain statement of the part performed by the
						Forty-fourth Indiana. The Forty-fourth had the first fight on Missionary Ridge, and
						commenced it near the spot where General Bragg, a few days after, established his
						headquarters, and it fought over the same hill-side that General Wood's column charged
						up, two months later, in the great battle of Missionary Ridge. Sergeant Gordon, Co. K,
						who was in the fight, relates that after the Regiment had fallen back to the railroad,
						volunteer <pb id="VAB1849-113" n="99"/> skirmishers were called for, and that Nicholas
						Ensly, Co. K, one of the number who responded, had a single-handed contest with a rebel.
						After firing four or five rounds at each other, "Nick" wounded his antagonist, drove him
						from under cover, captured his knapsack, finding it full of fresh meat, and meat
						only.</p>
					<p>The two regiments were sent out to the Ridge only to retard the approach of the enemy
						at that point, and were not expected to enter into a regular engagement. They executed
						their orders satisfactorily, and during the night were withdrawn, and went into bivouac
						in line of battle in a cemetery on the left of a spot where, in a few days afterward,
						Fort Wood was built. The enemy came over the Ridge, camped along the valley at its base,
						extending his line from the Tennessee River around to and including Lookout Point.</p>
					<p>The new flag was carried through the battle of Chickamauga and the engagement on
						Mission Ridge by Sergeant Owen Shaw, Co. C. Though slightly wounded several times, he
						clung to it all through, except for a few moments at one time when it was knocked out of
						his hands by a ball, which also struck his hand. He gathered it up immediately, and
						afterward planted it on the hill in front of Colonel Harker's line, in the crisis of the
						battle at that part of the line. He and three other sergeants, whose names we cannot
						recall, were subsequently examined and recommended for commissions in the colored
						regiments, for their gallantry in this battle.</p>

						<hi rend="center sc">THE SIEGE OF CHATTANOOGA.</hi>
					</head>

					<p>A<hi rend="sc">FTER</hi> a few days in bivouac on the left of Fort Wood, tents were
						brought, and we went into camp. The location was a splendid one for scenery, and an
						exciting one for peril. On our left ran the Tennessee, and beyond it Waldron's Ridge
						majestically stood frowning upon Lookout, Missionary Ridge, and all the surrounding
						country; in front and east, two miles distant, lay Mission Ridge, extending from the
						Tennessee southward. General Bragg's headquarters on the Ridge were in full view, and a
						large part of his army lay in the valley about midway; on the right extended the
						Chattanooga Valley southward, between Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain, and further
						to the west and the rear, as our line ran, towered Lookout Point, overlooking the town
						and the lines of both armies, where the enemy erected a battery and threw shells toward
						us day after day for a month. Around still further to the rear, a glimpse of Lookout
						Valley and Raccoon Mountains was presented, when the Waldron Ridge, footing up to the
						Tennessee as it wound around Moccasin Point, closed up the view. The railroad came up
						from Bridgeport, our base of supplies, through Lookout Valley and <pb id="VAB1849-115"
							n="101"/> around Lookout Point. But a few days after the battle of Chickamauga, the
						enemy took possession of Lookout Mountain, cut off our supplies by rail, and in a few
						days more sent detachments across Raccoon Mountain and cut off the approach of supplies
						by boat. Wagon trains were at once started to carry supplies from Bridgeport,
						twenty-five miles distant--air line--by way of the Sequatchie Valley and across
						Waldron's Ridge, making a circuitous route of sixty miles. The enemy crossed a large
						body of cavalry, under Wheeler, and captured and burned one train of three hundred
						wagons, but were finally repulsed, and this line of communication reopened after a
						manner, and the Union army thus, in connection with foraging expeditions up the little
						valleys on the north side of the river, kept from death by starvation. The road to
						Bridgeport became so lined with dead mules that died from starvation and exhaustion,
						that it became almost impassable for the stench. In camp the rations were reduced to
						one-half, one-third and then one-fourth, and some days none were issued at all. Sergeant
						Gordon, who dealt out the rations to his company, relates that on one occasion when the
						Regiment had drawn no rations for several days, and the men had become wild with hunger,
						he drew three and one-half Government crackers and three tablespoonfuls of coffee for
						his sixteen men. In order to give satisfaction, he broke the crackers up and formed the
						pieces into sixteen little piles of equal size, and thus distributed them; then the
						coffee he divided out by the grain. The boys of the Forty-fourth had gained some
						reputation, long before this, for skill in maintaining full <pb id="VAB1849-116" n="102"
						/> haversacks. Some General, none too dull of imagination, started the story that the
						men of the Forty-fourth Indiana could pick up a sheep grazing in the fields by the
						wayside, skin, dress, and divide it up among them without missing step in the march.
						Whatever their ability to provide for their haversacks, it did not forsake them in this
						trying emergency. The officers' horses, though, maintained only at the point of
						starvation, lost their rations of corn. Sacks of corn, black with must and rot, were
						found and then washed and dried, ground with coffee-mills, and made into bread. It was
						reported, though no one at the time would acknowledge it, that some of the boys on guard
						one night where a herd of cattle were crossed over the river for the army, managed to
						get up a stampede, and two or three of the cattle ran near the line of the Forty-fourth,
						where their flight was intercepted by the polls of axes in the hands of sturdy men on
						the lookout. There was no hoof, horn, or blood visible in the proximity of the camp the
						next morning, but the boys for several days appeared very contented to do without beef
						rations. Levi Wallack, Co. K, an eccentric and well-known character, was noted for the
						size of his haversack, it being about three times as large as others' and always well
						filled. But he was not partial, and balanced it by carrying on the other side a triple
						supply of ammunition, which he dealt out fearlessly to the enemy whenever opportunity
						offered. He did not know fear, and as little of discipline, unless he was inclined that
						way at the time. In the skirmish on Missionary Ridge he fired thirty-one rounds, and at
						every shot was heard to mutter, "There, dem you, take <pb id="VAB1849-117" n="103"/>
						that." One night, while on the picket, he ascertained that there were some cattle within
						the rebel picket lines. The old haversack was sadly depleted just then, so down he
						dropped on the ground and stealthily stole his way to the cattle, faced them for the
						Union lines, and started them on the run. The rebels sent the bullets whizzing after
						him, but when they ascertained that he had escaped, and come out with fifteen head of
						cattle, they joined the Union boys in a cheer over the exploit. Wallack was granted the
						privilege of killing three of the cattle for the benefit of himself and his
						regiment.</p>
					<p>None of these deprivations dampened the ardor of the men. They were heard to remark
						that they would prefer, after the mules and horses gave out, to go by detail to
						Bridgeport and carry up supplies on their backs, than abandon the position at
						Chattanooga. So far as suffering was concerned, there was little choice in the
						alternatives. These were, to starve until communications could be opened, surrender, or
						re-cross the Tennessee and flee for the Ohio River, three hundred miles distant, on the
						same roads marched over a year before from Battle Creek, only twenty miles distant. The
						lines of fortifications very soon became apparently impregnable. The enemy's guns on
						Lookout Point neither intimidated nor did any injury. An assault by the enemy was
						earnestly desired by the men, and the occasional threatenings of such an assault did
						much to reconcile the men to the situation; as also did the news from the North of the
						result of the elections of this month, which were received along the whole line with
						immense cheering.</p>



					<pb id="VAB1849-118" n="104"/>

					<p>General Rosecrans was relieved of the command of the Army of the Cumberland, October
						19th, by an order of the President, which established the military division of the
						Mississippi, General Grant in command and General Thomas in immediate command of the
						Army of the Cumberland. General Grant, instantly, upon receiving the order, telegraphed
						Thomas, "Hold Chattanooga at all hazards; I will be there as soon as possible." General
						Thomas as promptly replied, "We will hold the town until we starve." It was held.
						General Thomas had movements already in progress for breaking the blockade in the
						Tennessee River below. General Grant arrived on the 23d, and inspected and sanctioned
						the movements in hand. Hooker moved up from Bridgeport, where he had been concentrating,
						and a skillful movement down the Tennessee from Chattanooga on the night of the 26th, to
						Brown's Ferry, opened the river from Bridgeport to that point, only five miles distant.
						The two little boats in readiness commenced to bring up supplies, the size of the
						rations began to increase, and very soon the men began to change their speculations upon
						the possible duration of starvation to conjectures as to the time for advancing upon the
						enemy.</p>
					<p>In the reorganization of the army after the arrival of General Grant,
						Lieutenant-Colonel Aldrich was appointed Provost-Marshal of Chattanooga by General
						Thomas, and the Forty-fourth was assigned to Post duty, with Major Hodges in command.
						The Regiment broke camp on the front line November 8th, and moved into town, went into
						camp, and entered upon the <pb id="VAB1849-119" n="105"/> discharge of their new duty.
						This change deprived the Regiment from participating in the great battles on Lookout
						Mountain and Missionary Ridge, November 23d, 24th, and 25th. The booming cannon, and the
						rattling musketry on the left, center, and right, were distinctly heard, and the men
						standing in camp and at post witnessed, as the clouds lifted their vail from the
						mountain side, the grand battle of Hooker on Lookout Point, saw the rebel flag carried
						in retreat across the open field, near the white house under the cliff, and the stars
						and stripes of the Union, moistened by the heaven-kissed clouds, following close after
						the treacherous banner; and when the darkness of night enveloped the mountain, saw it
						lighted up from base to cliff by the flashes of musketry. From more elevated points were
						witnessed the advance of General Wood's division, in the center, and the capture of the
						first line of rifle-pits at the base of Missionary Ridge, the furious charge of General
						Sherman on the summits on the left, and the grand charge of General Thomas's corps in
						the center, up Missionary Ridge, and the capture of General Bragg's headquarters.</p>
					<p>The Forty-fourth boys, though they had before thought they had seen enough of battle at
						Fort Donelson, Shiloh, Stone River, and Chickamauga, were reinspired by the magnificent
						scene, and chafed under their new duties, and especially when they learned that their
						old brigade was one of the very first to scale the Ridge. Had they been with it, the
						banner of the Forty-fourth would undoubtedly have been planted once more on or near the
						very summit where it was two months before waved defiantly in the face of the enemy.</p>

					<p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> December, 1863, the regiments of 186i were offered extraordinary

					<p>Of the commissioned officers, Adjutant Smith, Captains Getty, Schell, Hildebrand,

					<p>As soon as transportation could be furnished, the veteran portion of the Regiment and
						the officers started <pb id="VAB1849-122" n="108"/> for home, reaching Fort Wayne
						without accident on the last of January. Here, with orders to obtain as many recruits as
						possible, and to rendezvous at Kendallville March 10th, all dispersed for their
						homes.</p>
					<p>They met with a hearty reception from friends and neighbors. "Ah, ha, old worn-out
						soldier, is it you?" was realized to be more than a poetic fancy. In a number of places
						public receptions were given, and the veterans treated with feasting and music.</p>
					<p>At the date for return, the veterans promptly met at Kendallville, bringing with them
						some one hundred and fifty recruits, and on the next day started for Indianapolis by way
						of Toledo. Upon reaching Toledo, the Regiment was very agreeably surprised to find a
						splendid supper for them in waiting at the Island House. The Regiment was detained at
						Indianapolis from the 12th to the 18th, when it again set out for the front, reaching
						Nashville, Tennessee, on the 20th. Here the railroad to Chattanooga was found
						overburdened with troops being pushed to the front, and by returning veterans. A large
						number were required to move on on foot, the Forty-fourth being of the number. The line
						of march was taken up on the 23d of April, by way of Murfreesboro, Tullahoma, Deckard,
						Manchester, Stevenson, to Bridgeport, which was reached in twelve days. Here
						transportation was provided, and the Regiment was, in a few hours, in Chattanooga again,
						ready for whatever duty might be assigned. The non-veterans had remained here on detail
						duty during the absence of the veterans.</p>

					</head>

					<p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> the reorganization of the Army of the Cumberland under General
						Thomas, in April, 1864, General James B. Steedman was placed in command of the garrison
						of Chattanooga, and had assigned to him the first separate brigade, consisting of the
						8th Kentucky Infantry, the 15th, 29th, 44th, 51st, 68th Indiana Infantry, and the 3d and
						24th Ohio Infantry, an engineer brigade, a pioneer brigade, eight colored regiments, and
						numerous batteries.</p>
					<p>Chattanooga was now the most important war center in the west, and was the point of
						concentration for the armies making ready to move southward under General Sherman, and
						was to be the base of supplies for all the movements then in hand. Whether it was more
						important and glorious to march on Atlanta or guard the base of operations and keep the
						communications open, was not for the Regiment to discuss, but that the services required
						were of grave importance and peril could readily be inferred from the assignment of one
						of the best fighting generals to the command of the garrison, and a number of the old
						and best fighting regiments to him. The Forty-fourth, on the 10th of April, relieved <pb
							id="VAB1849-124" n="110"/> the 15th, regulars, and took their camp on the hillside
						facing the town from the east, and resumed general guard duty. A number of the officers
						were detailed on courts-martial. In this capacity the officers and men served during the
						summer of 1864.</p>
					<p>Assistant-Surgeon Carr was in March promoted Surgeon of the 129th Indiana, and moved
						with his new command to the front. Dr. Edward B. Speed, of Lagrange, Indiana, a good
						physician and an estimable man, was appointed to the vacancy in July, but fell sick soon
						after his arrival, a misfortune which was due, in part, to a railroad accident on his
						way. He was taken to the officers' hospital on Lookout Mountain, where the best care and
						treatment possible in the army was provided, but he died September 15th. He never had an
						opportunity to get acquainted with many of the Regiment, but in his sickness had the
						sympathy of all, and the officers, upon his death, had his body embalmed at their
						expense and sent home.</p>
					<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Aldrich was in poor health all summer. Early in August he obtained a
						furlough and went home for the benefit of his health, but in a few days after reaching
						there he was suddenly taken worse, and died August 15th. His death was much lamented. He
						was a brave man, a good disciplinarian, and took great pride in the good appearance and
						discipline of his men. He had commanded the Regiment from Stone River to the day of his
						leave, except when temporarily absent on some other duty. He was commissioned Colonel in
						July, 1863, but could never be mustered as <pb id="VAB1849-125" n="111"/> such owing to
						the reduced number of men in the Regiment.</p>
					<p>The command now fell upon Major Joseph C. Hodges, who in a few days was mustered in as
						Lieutenant-Colonel. Early in September, when rebel General Hood turned his army
						northward, the whole line of communication from Atlanta to Nashville was roused into
						great activity. General Forrest crossed the Tennessee in the vicinity of Decatur,
						Alabama, September 20th, and at once advanced on Athens and the railroad communications
						with Nashville. General Steedman was ordered to send out troops to protect the line, and
						on the 28th the Forty-fourth, with other regiments, started northward on the railroad.
						The Regiment was carried on a train of freight cars, and moving slowly, reached
						Tullahoma about midnight. When within about three miles of this place,
						Lieutenant-Colonel Hodges, while walking on the cars looking after his command, by some
						accidental misstep fell between the cars and was run over by part of the train. His
						right knee and thigh were crushed into shreds. The train was stopped, he was taken up,
						put in a car, and carried to the hospital at Tullahoma, where his thigh was amputated
						near the hip joint. He never rallied from the operation, and died before morning. His
						sudden and untimely death was a severe shock to his command, by whom he was much
						respected for his bravery and devotion to the best interests of his men. The Regiment
						had now lost two Lieutenant Colonels and an assistant surgeon within less than forty
						days.</p>
					<p>The command now fell upon Major James F. Curtiss, who was soon after promoted
						Lieutenant-Colonel. The <pb id="VAB1849-126" n="112"/> Regiment lay at Tullahoma until
						October 2d, when it, with a number of other regiments, was ordered to report at once to
						General Rousseau, at Nashville, where it arrived that night, and before morning was
						mounted. Day dawned upon an inspiring scene, which, though, possessed some ridiculous
						and amusing features. General Rousseau, with some eight thousand cavalry, light
						artillery and mounted infantry, was moving rapidly southward on the Franklin pike,
						presenting, at first sight, a grand line. A little closer view, though, along the line
						of mounted infantry, revealed a fountain of material for the comic artist and humorist.
						The streets of the city and the corrals in the vicinity had been stripped of everything
						in the shape of a horse; the lame, the halt, and the blind had been gathered up for the
						expedition, and the Forty-fourth was especially unfortunate in the lot assigned it,
						being among the last to arrive. Men were mounted who had not been in the saddle for
						years, and some never. Many were on horses that could not be forced into a trot, and
						some not even into a walk. A number of horses were abandoned at the start, and the
						others as fast as the boys could find somebody to trade with. The trading was decidedly
						one-sided, but so poor was the country in horses at that time that no advantage could be
						obtained even in that way. Before starting on this trip, it may be remarked that after
						arrival at Chattanooga, while on duty in the dark--and it was very dark--Lieutenant
						Strecker, Company H, fell into a deep cut in the railroad, and was severely injured; and
						that just at this time, the State election in Indiana was pending, in <pb
							id="VAB1849-127" n="113"/> which every soldier was deeply interested, as upon its
						decision depended the re-election of their best friend in the State, Governor Morton. It
						was also a time General Thomas had good reason for being relieved of all disabled men.
						The opportunity was a rarely good one for the soldier to get home to vote, and
						Lieutenant Strecker and several others of the Regiment unfit for mounted service, who
						were left behind, were soon being whirled northward. Strecker reached his home about an
						hour before the closing of the polls, and did his duty.</p>
					<p>The Forty-fourth was assigned to Colonel Grosvenor's brigade of the expedition, with
						the surgeon of the Regiment as brigade surgeon. The first day, October 3d, the
						expedition marched to Franklin, twenty-one miles; October 4th, to Stone House, four
						miles south of Columbia; October 5th, to the vicinity of Lawrenceburg, twenty-six miles;
						October 6th, to Blue Creek, twenty-eight miles; October 7th, to Florence, Alabama, and
						thence down the river four miles to Cypress Mills. Here we came upon some of the rear
						guard of Forrest's command. Had a slight skirmish, killing one rebel. October 8th,
						marched out seven miles on the Savannah road; returned and marched four miles out on the
						Waterloo road; October 9th, marched about ten miles on the Waterloo road, and then
						countermarched to Cypress Mills. The enemy had safely escaped across the Tennessee
						River. October 10th, 11th, and 12th, in bivouac and foraging. In this expedition General
						Rousseau had to depend wholly upon the country for forage, and in part for rations for
						the men. The rebel forces had just <pb id="VAB1849-128" n="114"/> advanced and then
						retreated over the same country, living in like manner off of it. There were some most
						distressing scenes of poverty and misery seen. The people were literally stripped of all
						the provender and provisions they had in the world, and were, in many cases, apparently
						not left with enough to maintain life until they could flee to sections of the country
						not passed over by the two armies.</p>
					<p>October 13, marched on the return to within three miles of Athens, Alabama, making a
						distance of forty-eight miles. Went in bivouac at midnight, and arose at four o'clock in
						the morning, marched to Athens, turned over the horses, and at midnight took train for
						Chattanooga, arriving there in the afternoon, October 15th. The Regiment had been out
						nineteen days, and had traveled two hundred and eighty miles by railroad and two hundred
						miles on horseback. The men were satisfied with mounted service.</p>
					<p>Chattanooga was now again the scene of much activity. Rebel General Hood had flanked
						General Sherman at Atlanta, and was now striking his line of communication at various
						points, and advancing towards Chattanooga. General Thomas was concentrating all his
						forces as fast as possible at Chattanooga and points along the line. But Hood, when he
						reached La Fayette, turned westward, indicating his intention of invading Tennessee west
						of the Cumberland Range. General Sherman quickly reopened his lines, received his final
						equipments, and set out from Atlanta on his march to the sea. Thomas moved all the
						troops that could possibly be spared from East Tennessee, around to Bridgeport, <pb
							id="VAB1849-129" n="115"/> Stevenson, Tullahoma, and finally to Nashville, where he
						made his final stand against Hood.</p>
					<p>During November, the non-veterans of the Regiment having served three years, the term
						of enlistment, were mustered out, and early in December eleven commissioned officers
						also. The latter had entered the service as enlisted men for three years, and had since
						been promoted, and could not be held longer than their original enlistment, unless they
						had chosen to be so under the veteran enlistments. Only three of the original officers
						now remained: Lieutenant-Colonel Curtiss, Captain Grund, and Surgeon Rerick; and only
						about two hundred of the original men. On the 17th of November the Regiment was
						recruited by two hundred drafted men, and on the 20th by two hundred more, nearly all
						from the southern part of Indiana. These, with the previous volunteer recruits, gave the
						Regiment a numerical strength of some eight hundred.</p>
					<p>During the last days of November, General Steedman was ordered to hasten to Nashville
						with all available forces that could be spared. Chattanooga was so shorn of troops that
						all the citizens and sojourners were ordered to be enrolled as "Civic Guards," to assist
						in the protection of the post, should their services be needed. The front was now
						changed from the South to the North, from Atlanta to Nashville, and communications with
						the new front were cut about the first of December, and for about three weeks we were
						without news from the North, or from Nashville, even. They were wearisome and somewhat
						anxious days. Disaster at Nashville would have been disaster at Chattanooga, <pb
							id="VAB1849-130" n="116"/> and the loss of all that had been achieved in Kentucky,
						Tennessee, and of early all in the South-west. The new line would again have been the
						Ohio River, as at the beginning of the war. There was, probably, no more critical day in
						the whole war than the day General Thomas moved out from Nashville to attack Hood.
						General Grant's telegrams to Thomas show that he felt keenly the immense issues at
						stake. He had even started to Nashville to superintend the battle himself, but upon
						reaching Washington he was intercepted by a telegram announcing the great victory--great
						not only in valor, but in saving what had been attained in the South-west, and virtually
						ending the war in that part of the Union. There was no engagement of any magnitude after
						this, west of the Alleghany Mountains. Communications were opened on the 24th of
						December, and the soldiers at Chattanooga made glad by the receipt of a month's
						accumulated mail, and the "Civic Guards" pleased by a release from military restraints
						and prospective service.</p>

					<p>E<hi rend="sc">ARLY</hi> in January, 1865, the troops at Chattanooga were re-brigaded,
						the Forty-fourth being assigned to the 2d Brigade, 1st Separate Division of the Army of
						the Cumberland. The Regiment had now to assist in picket duty, as well as post duty. On
						the 29th of January the Forty-fourth was hastily moved by railroad to Athens, Tennessee,
						to repel a raid on that place, but upon reaching there found the raiders had already
						been repelled, and the Regiment returned the next day. On the way back, two cars of the
						train were thrown off the track by the spreading of the rails, killing Samuel A. Baker,
						Co. E, and severely wounding five others.</p>
					<p>And again, at midnight, February 4th, the Regiment was aroused, rushed to the depot,
						and put on board a train for Altowah, fifteen miles distant, to repel a raid of
						guerrillas, but returned the next day without having a sight at them. This was the last
						call on the Regiment to face the enemy during the rebellion.</p>
					<p>The news of the fall of Fort Sumter and capture of Charleston, reached Chattanooga
						February 22d, and was the occasion of great rejoicing. The heavy guns in the forts, and
						the field guns were fired, a score of engines at the depot blew their whistles, and the
						men screamed until hoarse or exhausted. The improvised <pb id="VAB1849-132" n="118"/>
						windows in the soldiers' "shanties," and many even in the more solid structures, were
						shattered by the concussion of the air. The best things in the soldiers' larders, and
						some things that had not got there before, were prepared for supper, and feasting and
						joy were unbounded.</p>
					<p>On March 17th, Lieutenant-Colonel Curtiss was promoted and mustered in as Colonel,
						Captain Grund as Lieutenant-Colonel, Captain Burch, Co. A, as Major, and Isaac N.
						Plummer, a regularly educated physician who had been drafted into the service at
						Evansville, Indiana, and was among the four hundred drafted men received in November
						before, and who had been recommended by the Surgeon, with the approval of the Colonel,
						for promotion to Assistant Surgeon, and commissioned by the Governor, was also mustered
						in, April 8th.</p>
					<p>The rejoicings of the Regiment over the surrender of Lee, and the grief over the
						assassination of President Lincoln, the writer did not witness, being at the time absent
						on leave. The men became quite anxious for a muster out after the surrender of the great
						rebel armies, but had to await the result of the predictions of guerrilla warfare, the
						adjustment of many war questions, and the disposition of the immense amount of army
						property accumulated. During the month of May thousands of rebels came into the post,
						surrendered, and returned to their homes. They brought with them a considerable amount
						of silver coin, which they largely spent in purchases, putting in circulation a currency
						that had not been seen before by Union soldiers since the opening of <pb
							id="VAB1849-133" n="119"/> the war. An exchange of greenbacks at the rate of $1.25 for
						a silver dollar was made, until almost every Union soldier had a silver piece which was
						claimed to be one of the identical dollars the Confederates had stolen from the United
						States mint at New Orleans.</p>
					<p>In June, one hundred and fifty of the drafted men were mustered out. General Steedman
						was relieved of command at Chattanooga about the first of July, and assigned to the
						command of the department of Georgia, with headquarters at Augusta. Captain Bradford,
						Co. H, who had served on his staff since the first assignment of the General to the
						Post, went with him, accompanied by his wife, who had come to her husband when the
						Regiment lay at McMinnville, in July, 1863, and had accompanied him on horseback in the
						march to Chickamauga, sharing the soldier's fare of her husband nearly all the time
						since.</p>
					<p>The Forty-fourth, under the new arrangements, was assigned to the District of East
						Tennessee, and required to report by letter to General A. C. Gillam, commanding at
						Knoxville. About the middle of July the troops left in East Tennessee were formed into
						two brigades, composed each of white and colored regiments. The second brigade consisted
						of the 44th Indiana Infantry, the 11th Michigan Infantry, and the 16th, 18th, 42d and
						44th United States Colored Infantry, with Colonel Johnson, of the 44th U. S. C. I. in
						command. The Surgeon of the 44th Indiana was detailed on his staff as Brigade Surgeon,
						and Captain M. B. Willis, Co. K, as Inspector General.</p>
					<p>The "spotted brigade" arrangement was the occasion of much joking and amusement, but
						much of it <pb id="VAB1849-134" n="120"/> not so merry as to hide the deep-seated
						prejudice of the white soldiers to such close relations with the colored race. This
						prejudice was fully developed in a few days, when the guard detail was required to form
						in line with guard details from the colored regiments, at guard mounting. Men who had
						passed through nearly four years' service, and readily obeyed every order in battle, on
						march, and in camp, now hesitated to form in line with colored men, and obey the orders
						of white officers of colored regiments. They actually stacked arms, voluntarily
						surrendered themselves, and with their Lieutenant in charge, who surrendered his sword,
						submitted to be marched off to the guard-house under a colored guard, and there be
						guarded by colored soldiers. The citizens took side with the white soldiers, and many
						seemed ready to fan up a general disturbance. But this was readily averted. Colonel
						Curtiss at once called upon the brigade commander, and they upon the Provost Commandant,
						and all visited the men. They were released after a few hours' detention, and the next
						day guard mounting was gone through in regular form, the white details being formed
						under their own officer, on the same line with the colored detail, though at a
						"respectable distance."</p>
					<p>This event, though showing considerable inconsistency and prejudice, nevertheless
						marked much progress on the part of white soldiers in their regard for the colored race.
						When they first entered the service they would not have accorded freedom to the slave;
						now they respected their freedom, and their right and privilege of serving the same
						country as soldiers, but had <pb id="VAB1849-135" n="121"/> not yet advanced to the
						point where they would not feel that there would be an odious equality in forming in
						line with them in peaceful guard mounting. Had they been forming a line of battle, there
						would have been no objection. Patriots can, in the face of peril and death, forget the
						prejudices that may rule them on fancy parade in times of peace.</p>
					<p>During the month of July, one hundred and fifty more of the drafted men were mustered
						out. In August the "grape vine" dispatches began to thicken fast of a probable early
						muster-out, and the officers began to prepare their papers for the earnestly hoped-for
						event. The Surgeon, after an examination of all his medical reports since the Regiment
						entered the service, made, at the time, a summary as follows: <list type="simple"
							rend="b">
							<item>Died of disease, <hi rend="right">212</hi></item>
							<item>Died of wounds, <hi rend="right">26</hi></item>
							<item>Killed on the field, <hi rend="right">39</hi></item>
							<item>Whole number of deaths, <hi rend="right">277</hi></item>
							<item>Whole number killed and wounded, <hi rend="right">350</hi></item>
						</list>
					</p>

					<p>Of these, twelve were commissioned officers, and two hundred and sixty-five enlisted
						men. Two officers were killed on the field, two died of wounds, one from railroad
						injury, and five of disease.</p>

					<list type="simple" rend="b">
						<item>Died with the command in camp or in Regimental Hospital, <hi rend="right"
							>58</hi></item>
						<item>Died in General Hospital, or at home, <hi rend="right">180</hi></item>
						<item>Killed in the field as above, <hi rend="right">39</hi></item>
						<item>Total, <hi rend="right">277</hi>
						</item>
					</list>

					<p>There was but one death from disease in Regimental Hospital or camp quarters after
						August 1st, 1863. There <pb id="VAB1849-136" n="122"/> were some one thousand five
						hundred and fifty men altogether in the command, exclusive of about three hundred from
						the 68th and 72d Indiana, assigned to it a few weeks before muster cut. The recruits
						received were: Fifty in the fall of 1862; one hundred and forty in the spring of 1864;
						four hundred drafted men and substitutes in November, 1864; three hundred and sixty men,
						detachments of the 68th and 72d Indiana Regiments. Of the recruits, one was killed, and
						forty died of disease. This leaves the casualties of the original officers and men at
						two hundred and thirty-five, or about twenty-four per centum.</p>
					<p>The distance traveled by the Regiment during its service, on foot, on horse, by boat,
						and by railroad, including return home on veteran furlough, was about five thousand
						miles. About fifteen hundred miles of the distance was marched on foot.</p>
					<p>Adjutant General Terrell's report shows the total number belonging to the Regiment to
						have been twenty-two hundred and three. But in this he counts the veterans twice, as
						original enlisted men and again as enlisted veterans, and also a large number of
						unassigned recruits.</p>
					<p>The welcome order of relief from further duty as soldiers came September 3d, and on the
						6th the Regiment boarded a train for Nashville, reaching there on the 7th. The
						Chattanooga <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi>, in noticing the departure of the Regiment,
						said:</p>
					<p rend="b">"The officers and men of the 44th Indiana V. V. I. have, during their stay in
						this city, won the respect and admirat on of the citizens as a brave and well
						disciplined <pb id="VAB1849-137" n="123"/> regiment. They will take with them to their
						homes in Indiana the hearty wishes of the citizens and residents of Chattanooga."</p>
					<p>The muster-out rolls were prepared at Nashville, and the Regiment was mustered out
						September 14th, 1865, and then sent on to Indianapolis for payment and final discharge.
						There were six hundred and seventy men and thirty five officers mustered out at this
						time. Of these, one hundred and ninety-three were original enlisted men and three
						original officers. Thirty-two of the officers mustered out entered the service as
						enlisted men, and the three original officers, Colonel Curtiss and Lieutenant-Colonel
						Grund, as Second Lieutenants, and Surgeon Rerick as Assistant Surgeon. Eighty-nine of
						the original men were mustered out as non-commissioned officers, and seventy-one as
						privates.</p>

					<list type="simple" rend="b">
						<item>Original commissioned officers <hi rend="right">39</hi></item>
						<item>Mustered out September 14th, 1865, <hi rend="right">3</hi></item>
						<item>Original enlisted men <hi rend="right">950</hi></item>
						<item>Mustered out September 14th, 1865, <hi rend="right">193</hi></item>
					</list>

					<p>The earliest date of the commissions to the company officers at the organization of the
						Regiment was September 20th, 1861, and this, we judge, was the earliest date of
						enlistment by the men. Three commissions for field and staff officers for the
						organization of the Regiment were issued September 12th, 1861. The Surgeon mustered out
						bore one of these three commissions, and had therefore served four years and two days,
						the longest service shown on the record of any member of the Regiment. And an
						examination of Adjutant General Terrell's reports shows this to have <pb
							id="VAB1849-138" n="124"/> been the longest service in the field of any medical
						officer from the State, with possibly one exception.</p>
					<p>As soon as payment was made at Indianapolis, the Regiment disbanded, every man
						returning to his home, where he at once donned the garb and assumed the duties of the
						private citizen.</p>
					<p>The farewell address of General Grant in June, 1865, to the Armies of the United
						States, being as largely applicable to the Forty-fourth Indiana as any other regiment in
						the service of the Union, and being a tribute worthy the remembrance of every ex-soldier
						and loyal citizen, will summarize and close our record:</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">

							<p>C<hi rend="sc">OLONEL</hi> H<hi rend="sc">UGH</hi> B. R<hi rend="sc">EED</hi> is a
								native of Ohio, and studied for the medical profession in Cincinnati, where he
								afterward engaged in the drug business. In 1845 he moved to Fort Wayne, and at the
								breaking out of the war was conducting an extensive wholesale and retail business as
								a druggist. He answered the first call of the Government for troops by aiding in
								raising and organizing the 12th Regiment of Indiana Volunteers, and when a camp was
								ordered at Fort Wayne for the organization of the 30th and 44th Regiments, he was
								placed in command of the camp by Governor Morton; and as soon as the first was
								organized, and enough for the second regiment was assured, was commissioned Colonel
								of the 44th. He led it as coolly and bravely as a troop was ever led, in the battles
								of Fort Donelson and Shiloh, to which reference is more fully made in the
								description of those battles. He commanded the Regiment in the advance on Corinth,
								and in the march from there to Booneville, Miss., and thence to Tuscumbia, Athens,
								Stevenson, Ala., and to Battle Creek, Tenn. Up to this time he had not been absent a
								day from his command. <pb id="VAB1849-144" n="130"/> Here he was granted a short
								leave of absence, but rejoined the Regiment soon after it had crossed the Cumberland
								Mountains upon the Buell and Bragg foot-race, and was with it, most of the time, in
								the tiresome march to Nashville, Louisville, Perrysville, Wild Cat, and back to
								Nashville. His health was much impaired in the service, and he resigned, November
								26, 1862, and at the close of the war, to promote his health, moved to the East, and
								now resides at Somerville, N. J., in the vicinity of New York.</p>

									>ILLIAMS</hi> is a native of Pennsylvania; received a classical and medical
								education, and was, at the breaking out of the war, a practicing physician at
								Albion, Noble county, Indiana. He entered the service as Captain of Company G, which
								he helped to recruit. With Companies G and K he was in command of the Post at
								Henderson, Ky., from January to the middle of March, 1862, rejoined the Regiment
								with his command on its way up the Tennessee River to Pittsburg Landing, led his
								company in the battle of Shiloh, and thence in all the marches until promoted
								Colonel to fill, the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of Colonel Reed, November
								27, 1862. He led the Regiment in the battle of Stone River, where, on the third day,
								in the furious charge of General Breckenridge on the left, he was captured, and
								afterwards sent to Libby Prison. After several months' detention there he was
								exchanged, and returned to the Regiment at McMinnville, Tenn., where he was received
								with much joy by the Regiment. Resigned July 27, 1863. Since the war he has filled
								the office of Clerk of his county two terms, and now resides at Albion, Indiana.</p>

								1st, 1861, and in a few days commenced to assist in recruiting Company K; was
								elected First Lieutenant, but was soon promoted to Captain, and led the Company in
								the battle of Shiloh. Was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel, November 27, 1862,
								conmmanded the Regiment from January 2, 1862, and led it through the battle of
								Chickamauga. In this battle, after the lines were broken, and the brigade and
								division scattered, he led the Forty-fourth, without orders, except the sound of
								artillery showing where heroes were needed, to the left, coming to the aid of
								General Harker's line, in General Thomas's command, at a most critical moment, and
								rendered a service that won for him and the Regiment flattering comments from
								Generals Thomas, Wood, and Harker, who were eye-witnesses. He found his brigade and
								division after the battle. As soon as the army fell back to Chattanooga, he was sent
								out with the 44th and the 13th Ohio Volunteers to Missionary Ridge, to observe and
								retard the approach of the enemy, and here had a brisk skirmish. November 8th, 1863,
								he was appointed Provost-Marshal of Chattanooga, and the Regiment placed on Post
								duty. He filled the duties of Provost-Marshal until the Regiment re-enlisted, when
								he accompanied the veterans home, and returned with them to Chattanooga, and was in
								command of the Regiment until early in August, 1863, when he was granted leave of
								absence on account of ill-health. A few days after he reached home he was suddenly
								taken worse, and died, August 15, 1863. He was commissioned as Colonel, July 27,
								1863, but owing to the reduced number of men in the Regiment, could never be
								mustered in as such.</p>

								not mustered as such; promoted Lieutenant-Colonel, September 28, 1864, and Colonel,
								March 12, 1865, and was mustered out with the Regiment. He was with the Regiment in
								all its marches and battles, from the first to the last day of its service. His
								bravery was noted in all the battles, and especially complimented by his commander
								at Chickamauga. He returned after the war to Elkhart, and a few years after went
								from there to Northern Michigan and entered a soldier's homestead, but while working
								on it, one day, suddenly died.</p>

								from the affects of a railroad accident near Tullahoma, Tenn., September 28, 1864,
								as more fully noted in the preceding pages. He participated in all the movements and
								battles of the Regiment from the first day of its entrance into the service until
								the hour of his death. He was brave as a lion, and too impulsive to witness
								cowardice without burning indignation. An instance of the latter occurred when the
								Regiment was marching out to engage the enemy at Shiloh, on the morning of April
								6th. General Prentiss' division had been surprised and routed, and detachments of it
								were fleeing back as the Regiment marched out. A stampeded Colonel came dashing
								along to the rear, exclaiming, "We're whipped, we're whipped; we're all cut to
								pieces!" Lieutenant Hodges was marching along with his company, but his wrath
								boiling over, he rushed from the line, caught the cowardly Colonel's horse by the
								bridle, at the same time drawing his revolver, and exclaimed: "You ---- cowardly
								wretch, utter those words again and you are a dead man! You infernal coward, have
								you no more sense than to try and demoralize troops going into action? Go to the
								rear, you coward, but don't open your head on the way." The trembling coward did not
								resent, but it was noticed he rode at a more moderate gait, and it is supposed was
								somewhat more reflective.</p>

					<p>N<hi rend="sc">OTE</hi>.--In the record of the Companies, all mention of dishonorable
						discharge of the officers, and the names of the men who deserted the service, are
						omitted. The names of all such can be found in Adjutant-General Terrell's report, in
						every county officer's office in the State. This is, we think, a sufficient reminder of
						these unpleasant things, at this late date. The record of the original enlisted men is
						first given--those who entered the service at the organization of the Regiment, and were
						mustered in November 22, 1861, for three years. These are classified as "Veterans":
						those who re-enlisted for another three years' service, and were mustered in as
						veterans, January 9, 1864, and were mustered out with the Regiment, September 11, 1863.
						2d. "Three Years Men": those who were mustered out at the end of three years'
						enlistment, November, 1861. 3d. The original men killed on the field, discharged on
						account of disability from wounds or disease, and those transferred, will be found under
						the heads, "Killed," "Discharged," and "Transferred." 4th. All who enlisted after the
						Regiment entered the service will be found under the head of "Recruits," except
						substitutes and drafted men. These came mostly from the southern part of the State, and
						were with the Regiment but a few months. The word "dead" is attached to the names of
						those who are known to have died since discharge or muster-out, and the present
						residence of the survivors given when known. The rank following a name indicates the
						rank when mustered out.</p>

							<p>The records of the Company as published by the Adjutant-General of the State, are

								have in respect to the following, I am indebted to Samuel B. Sweet, of Fort Wayne.
								Mr. Sweet was but a few months past sixteen years of age when he entered the
								service. He was at first set aside by the mustering officer, as too young, but his
								importunity and tears finally prevailed, and he was duly mustered in. His record as
								a soldier was an excellent one. He was in all marches and battles of the Regiment,
								was slightly wounded at Shiloh, Stone River, and Chickamauga, but was never <pb
									id="VAB1849-178" n="160"/> in hospital on account of sickness. After a service of
								four years and one month, he was mustered out with the Regiment. In 1866 he entered
								the employ of the Wabash railway company as bill clerk at Fort Wayne, and was
								promoted freight and ticket agent in 1874, which position he still holds. In honor
								to the privates of the Regiment and the patriotic boys of that day, we present
								elsewhere a picture of this model citizen-soldier.</p>

							<p>Albert Heath entered the service as Captain, at date above mentioned, led his
								Company at the battle of Fort Donelson, and acted as Major for the Regiment at
								Shiloh, where he was conspicuous for daring bravery. In the afternoon of the first
								day of the battle, while the Regiment was fighting on the left, and during the
								momentary absence of the Colonel, who was obeying some order from the Brigade
								commander, the acting Major ordered a charge, and crying out, "Remember Buena
								Vista," led on. The men bravely followed, but were slaughtered in the few moments
								that followed more than during any hour of the day. He received honorable mention by
								the Colonel in his official report, led his Company on from there to Corinth, Battle
								Creek, Louisville, and back to Nashville, when he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel
								of the 100th Regiment, and afterward to Colonel. Was wounded under Sherman at
								Missionary Ridge. Resides now at San Francisco, Cal.</p>

						<p>The Forty-fourth Indiana Regiment was well favored in respect to Sutlers. Wesley
							Parks, after his resignation as Captain of Company K, was appointed Sutler, and filled
							the place until April 22, 1862, when he resigned on account of ill health. His son, A.
							B. Parks, succeeded him, and assisted by his brother Henry, served the Regiment with
							sutler supplies until the day of its muster out. Their dealings with the officers and
							men were honorable and generous. In several financial emergencies they rendered
							important and needful aid. They are both living now at Kendallville, Indiana, and at
							the first reunion of the Regiment, April 6, 1880, manifested their old war-time
							generosity and kindness by taking charge of all the arrangements for the meeting, and
							providing a free supper for the soldiers present.</p>

						<p>A<hi rend="sc">T</hi> the suggestion of our friend, the Author of this History, I
							will attempt to give some personal recollections that may at least interest those who
							took part in the stirring times to which they refer.</p>
						<p>As Major Rerick has well said of our Regiment, it was composed of the better class of
							citizens, many of its members occupying independent positions in life. They left their
							farms, shops, stores and homes, at their country's call, from no other than patriotic
							motives. There was no thought of drafting or bounty at that day. They gave up home,
							family, friends, to fight their country's battles, from love for these-- that their
							children might retain the blessings which had thus far been theirs. This alone
							prompted them to cast aside every comfort and all that had heretofore made life
							desirable, <pb id="VAB1849-242" n="216"/> to face the dangers of the battle-field,
							death in hospital, starvation and inhumanity in rebel prisons; to give up their own
							liberty to the will, and too often the caprice, of men no better nor wiser than
							themselves. As our Chaplain, Dr. Beeks, said in a sermon he preached while we were at
							Evansville, Ind., where he had formerly resided: "The men of my Regiment are of the
							salt of the earth, every man of the I.ooo being the equal of the highest and best in
							your midst."</p>
						<p>After leaving Indianapolis for the front, and while at Evansville, Ind., awaiting
							orders, the Colonel received a letter from General T. L. Crittenden, to whose Division
							the 44th Indiana had been assigned, welcoming us to the tented field. About the same
							time a committee from the loyal citizens of Henderson, Ky., visited our camp, urging
							the importance of our Regiment going to that point for their protection from rebels
							that beset their town. When this was represented at headquarters by the Colonel, the
							44th was ordered to Henderson, Ky., where it was most hospitably received by many
							Union-loving citizens, and as heartily cursed by those of rebel proclivities.</p>
						<p>While here, "my nigger" was the main topic of interest with all-Union and rebel. The
							slaves thought the year of jubilee had come, and were marching for the land of Canaan,
							and naturally came to the Regiment for help across the river. Nor were they
							disappointed, in so far as members of the Regiment could help them "over the river,"
							notwithstanding the "strict orders " to the contrary. The Colonel could only wink at
							it and abuse the Adjutant, who was a full blooded <pb id="VAB1849-243" n="217"/>
							Abolitionist and an ex Congressman to boot. They must not be seen, but they were hid
							in all parts of the camp.</p>
						<p>Even in this year of grace 1880 very few people but those that were in the army have
							any conception of the intense interest manifested by the people of the Slave States
							for their "institution." Intelligent, well-to-do planters would ride for days with the
							Regiment on its marches, to try to capture a slave of whose escape they had heard, or
							even from thinking it probable there might be one with us--not their own, but a <hi
								rend="i">slave</hi>, no matter whose. They gave up their time, labor and money to
								<hi rend="i">that</hi>, under all circumstances. To help catch "a runaway nigger"
							was more exciting than a fox hunt; a pair of hand-cuffs was a toy carried in the coat
							pocket, to be slipped on the wrists--representing the brush stuck in the cap of the
							victor.</p>
						<p>The slaves were hunted like hares, and were covered up, the pursuers foiled, thrown
							off the scent, with equal zest. When just about ready to leave Henderson for Green
							River, they pounced down upon and drove two "likely boys" to cover, in an old cabin in
							our camp. While the captors were getting out their manacles, one of the "boys" as
							quick as a flash was past them, out the door and away. His shadow was often seen
							afterwards, flitting from wagon to tent. The other, slower witted, gave up mournfully,
							and without a word submitted to be carried off. On another occasion, at Calhoun, Ky.,
							a "boy" hotly pursued was boxed up, a canteen of water and his rations added, and
							shipped to Evansville, Ind., to a <hi rend="i">sure</hi> friend. Major Stoughton,
							Surgeon 217 <pb id="VAB1849-244" n="218"/> Martin--both Democrats of the strictest
							sect, the former having been candidate for Elector on the Breckenridge ticket, and
							Surgeon Martin a man of as much weight in the councils of his party at home as any
							other--and Sergeant Sol. DeLong (afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel of another Indiana
							regiment), stood godfathers to this deliverance from bonds to freedom. This is but an
							illustration of the spirit with which the game was played-- one intent on capture, the
							other on defeating the wily slave-catcher--as it also illustrates theory <hi rend="i"
								>versus</hi> practice. Both Stoughton and Martin were pro-slavery at home, and the
							members of the 44th Indiana, generally, indignantly spurned the imputation of going
							out to free the slaves of our "Southern brethren," as was charged by rebel
							sympathizers.</p>
						<p>And yet these same men were the most hospitable, kind and companionable to be found
							anywhere. Should you visit their house, if nothing was on their table but "coon pone,"
							you would be pressed to partake with the same cordiality as if a feast had been
							prepared. Their <hi rend="i">bonhommie</hi> and geniality were irresistible. With a
							bottle of peach, apple or Bourbon at their elbow to cheer, all care was given to the
							dogs, enjoyment reigned supreme.</p>

						<head rend="center b">CHAPTER II.</head>

						<p>A<hi rend="sc">FTER</hi> some weeks the Regiment became weary of inactivity, the men
							longed to be doing something--to push on, and help put down these rebels in arms; this
							done, to go home to their legitimate callings. We took up our line of march for
							Calhoun, Ky., where we joined our Division, under command of General Crittenden. Here
							we spent some time in drilling, and marching up and down Green River in the mud and
							slush of that malarious region, and passed through the fiery ordeal of acclimation to
							camp life. The hospital was soon filled with those that had been used to a far
							different life.</p>
						<p>After marching to South Carrolton and back without meeting the enemy, the order for
							our brigade alone to prepare for a campaign against Fort Henry and Fort Donelson was
							hailed with the liveliest anticipations by all. To go where some fighting was to be
							done delighted every one but the unfortunate sick in the hospital. After the mud,
							slush, drill, bad fare, malaria, and Buell's slow movements, it was glorious to be
							booming <pb id="VAB1849-246" n="220"/> down the Ohio by steamer. When we arrived at
							Fort Henry we found General Grant preparing his forces for a march to Fort Donelson.
							Our brigade was ordered to return by steamer down the Tennessee and up the Cumberland
							River to Fort Donelson. The whole army was jubilant. Speeches of the spread-eagle
							order were made from the decks of our steamers, in tones that made the welkin
							ring--doubtless (?) making the hearts of the secesh quake, as they rang from the river
							banks to the wooded hills and valleys between. While still under this patriotic
							fervor, it was proposed and carried <hi rend="i">nem. con.</hi> that the Colonels of
							the brigade should in a body call upon and offer our congratulations to the commanding
							General, and take his dimensions. We found General Grant in the cabin of his steamer,
							deeply immersed in the plans of his campaign, and apparently weighed down with his
							responsibilities, great drops of sweat standing on his brow. But a few months
							previously I had met <hi rend="i">Captain</hi> Grant on board the cars of the Illinois
							Central railroad, acting as mustering-in officer. Myself and friend were on our way to
							Cairo, to take a look at the military at that important post, hoping we might see a
							fight. We were well provided with good cigars and Cognac, and being interested in all
							that pertained to military affairs, we soon made acquaintance with Captain Grant. He
							informed us that he had been elected Captain of a company raised at his town, and had
							refused to accept; that having been a Captain in the regular army, he felt that he was
							entitled to a higher position; but proffered to drill and go with them to the
							rendezvous at Springfield, where he hoped to find a <pb id="VAB1849-247" n="221"/>
							better opening. He had been disappointed, and was about to return home, when a friend
							had interested himself in his behalf with the Governor, who had thereupon sent for
							him, and offered him a position on his staff until opportunity presented for something
							better; and he was then engaged in mustering in recruits along the line of that road.
							The something better soon came, and here we find him at the head of an army invading
							the "sacred soil" of Kentucky and Tennessee.</p>
						<p>On the following day we steamed down the river to Paducah, where we were joined by
							other steamers bearing troops for the same destination, the whole making a grand
							procession, with banners, music and cheers, perhaps the most impressive sight that had
							there been seen, witnessed from the river banks on either shore with bounding hearts
							or gnashing teeth, as the beholder's sympathies inclined North or South in the coming
							conflict.</p>
						<p>The boat on which the 44th Indiana was embarked was the fastest of the fleet. There
							were no "orders" on the subject of procedure, and we were in no way averse to taking
							the benefit of our speed. The Colonel of a regiment of Kansas "jay-hawkers," whose
							steamer had started from Paducah first, bellowed himself hoarse in protest and
							threats, making much merriment by his efforts to drown the whistle of our steamer,
							standing on a stool, gesticulating and perspiring. His regiment had the reputation of
							cleaning a <hi rend="i">green</hi> regiment out of all their possessions. When they
							passed through a camp it was left as bare as a field of grain by the army-worm. This
							made "old soldiers" of <hi rend="i">that</hi> regiment when they <pb id="VAB1849-248"
								n="222"/> awoke to a realizing sense of their condition, in the morning. The next
								<hi rend="i">green</hi> regiment had to pay the penalty.</p>
						<p>When our imposing and brilliant array had reached the vicinity of Dover, the 44th
							Indiana was disembarked, and at once marched forward to the battle-field. Knowing
							little what awaited us, we made small preparation for creature comfort. When night
							found us in front of the enemy's entrenchments, not permitted a fire to cook our
							coffee, most of our blankets left with a guard at the landing, and no means of getting
							them, without rations, our first introduction to the enemy was not made under the most
							favorable circumstances. We were compelled to "bundle" as best we could to protect
							ourselves from the cold of the most inclement night of the year. The snow that fell
							during the night covered us like a garment. On our beds of dry sticks we slept the
							sleep of the just. In the morning we drank our coffee, munched our "hard-tack," which
							had now reached us, fell in, and marched forward to the attack. The 44th Indiana's
							first position was taken, by request of General McClernand, in support of a battery.
							Here the enemy's shot were aimed too high. passing over our heads. After a time, the
							enemy not assaulting as expected, we moved further in advance, and formed our line of
							battle on the left of the 17th Kentucky (being part of our brigade--the 1st Brigade of
							Lew. Wallace's Division). As we moved forward we received a heavy fire, wounding a
							number of our men. When our line of battle was formed, Colonel John A. Logan, of the
							32d Illinois, came to me and asked that I withhold our <pb id="VAB1849-249" n="223"/>
							fire for a time. I complied with his request, which I found a much more difficult
							matter than he, probably, and I most certainly, anticipated, as we were exposed to the
							enemy's fire for what seemed an interminable time --the bullets whistling about our
							ears and the men being wounded, thus making our position a very trying one in this our
							first baptism of fire. The enemy's fire slackening, to make sure there were no others
							than the enemy in our front (the brush and small timber obstructing our view), that we
							might get at them without further delay, Captain Bingham, Co H, carried our flag
							forward to a prominent position and waved it in the air as a gage of battle. This was
							at once responded to by a volley, and answered with great zest by the men, who had
							hitherto served only as targets. General McClernand's troops had fallen back. A
							portion of our brigade alone was left. The enemy being repulsed in our immediate
							front, an attempt was now made to turn our left flank with cavalry and infantry. Three
							companies of our left wing were wheeled to the right, and opened fire upon and
							repulsed their attempt to get to our rear. The Colonel's attention was now called to a
							fact which we had been too much occupied to notice, that the 44th was entirely alone,
							and the other regiments of our brigade had withdrawn. Having repulsed the enemy and
							thwarted their attempt to surround us, we slowly withdrew, in perfect order. After
							going some distance we were met by the Colonel commanding the brigade, who informed me
							that our forces were at a certain point, where we joined them. While occupying this
							position we could see the enemy reforming his lines, on a steep <pb id="VAB1849-250"
								n="224"/> wooded hill, not far from the battle-field of the morning. After some
							delay our brigade was ordered, in conjunction with Colonel Morgan L. Smith's brigade,
							to storm the very strong position held by the enemy. The 8th Missouri had the advance.
							When the 44th Indiana arrived at the scene of action, the 8th Missouri was hotly
							engaged in by far the fiercest contest of the day. We at once pressed forward to their
							aid, and formed our line of battle amid a hurricane of bullets. Finding that we were
							in rear of the 8th Missouri, we were compelled to perform the difficult feat of
							changing our position to the left of that regiment under the heavy fire of the enemy,
							which was done. We then charged up the hill in the most gallant style, at double
							quick, cheering loudly. Without intending thereby to detract from Colonel Morgan L.
							Smith and the 8th Missouri, who fought gloriously, it was the charge of the 44th
							Indiana that started the rebels from their position. We pursued them some distance,
							and were then joined by other regiments of the brigade which had passed further to the
							left. While consulting as to whether we should pursue them into their works, they
							opened fire upon us with artillery, the shot and shell falling in our midst. An order
							was now received from General Grant, recalling us. We returned to the foot of the hill
							from whence we had routed the enemy, and bivouacked for the night.</p>
						<p>We were ordered to attack their works early next morning. We were all ready to march
							forward, when news reached us of the surrender. This not being official, we continued
							our march. The 44th Indiana, at the head of the column, passed over their
							entrenchments <pb id="VAB1849-251" n="225"/> and through the ranks of the enemy, drawn
							up in line of battle. We marched to the landing at Dover, and took possession of the
							immense stores of captured property.</p>
						<p>From some cause the 44th Indiana failed to receive, in the reports of the brigade and
							division commanders, the credit to which it was justly entitled for the part performed
							by it in the battles of the morning and afternoon of February 15th. With no intention
							to lessen or in any way detract from other regiments engaged, I will here say that to
							the 8th Missouri and the 44th Indiana belong the honor of storming the position held
							by the enemy on the hill, and their defeat here induced the surrender of the Fort next
							morning. The part of the 44th in this most important engagement attending the capture,
							was as conspicuous and brilliant as that of any regiment engaged. We were exposed to
							the same bullets as were the 8th Missouri, which had the advance. The 44th formed in
							line of battle under a heavy fire, moved to the immediate left of that regiment, and
							made the brilliant charge which decided the battle. In my official report I say:						
						<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"My regiment advanced to the foot of the hill occupied by the enemy, formed in line
							of battle in the face of a storm of bullets. Finding the ground in our front occupied
							by the 8th Missouri regiment, I advanced my regiment one hundred yards, faced to the
							front, and charged up the hill at double quick--our men loudly cheering."</p>
						</q>
							</p>						
						<p>And yet General Lew Wallace, by a shuffle, manages to give to the 11th Indiana the
							position occupied by the 44th Indiana, in his official report, without reason or <pb
								id="VAB1849-252" n="226"/> justice, unless it may have been that the 11th Indiana
							was his former regiment.</p>
						<p>As has been said elsewhere, the 44th Indiana fought its own battles of the morning
							and afternoon, without seeing or receiving an order from any other officer than its
							own Colonel commanding, after taking up its line of march for the battle-field. Had
							either brigade or division commander been with us, we could hardly have failed
							receiving the justice denied us in their official reports.</p>
						<p>Immediately after the surrender our brigade received marching orders, and we returned
							to Fort Henry, where we remained for a time, while the Army was reorganized. Our 1st
							Brigade, 3d Division, was transformed into 3d Brigade, 4th Division, General S. A.
							Hurlbut commanding.</p>
						<p>The reorganization of the Army completed, we were now ready for a forward movement
							into the heart of rebeldom. Early in March, 1862, the Army was embarked at Fort Henry
							on steamers and transports, with attendant gunboats, for Pittsburg Landing, making
							altogether, the grandest spectacle ever seen by the inhabitants of that wild region.
							All were warriors of tried metal now. Each Hector and Achilles wore his honors thick
							upon his brow, to whom all must homage pay. Had not Fort Henry and Fort Donelson
							succumbed to the prowess of these mighty men? Why should we not feel that "No pent up
							Utica contracts our powers--that all the boundless continent was ours"?</p>
						<p>Our fleet was composed of the largest Mississippi River steamers (whose occupation
							was gone), loaded <pb id="VAB1849-253" n="227"/> down with victorious troops; our
							banners proudly floating in the Southern breeze, as we boldly steamed up the
							Tennessee; bands playing the most martial and inspiring airs; a sight long to be
							remembered by all--every heart swelling with "the pride, pomp and circumstance of
							glorious war." And yet there was an under-current of more subdued feeling, that
							Donelson had taught, which contrasted with the joyous abandon that attended our voyage
							to Fort Henry and thence to Fort Donelson. Then the realities of "the siege, the
							fight, the disastrous chances of the deadly breach," were before us only in
							imagination, while now we understood the full significance of "soldiers slain, and all
							the currents of a heady fight."</p>
						<p>On the way up the river many conflicts as to seniority occurred, each division and
							brigade commander claiming to outrank all others.</p>
						<p>The 44th Indiana embarked on a steamer on which was part of a regiment belonging to
							General McClernand's division, in command of a Lieutenant-Colonel, who informed me in
							the most kindly manner that his orders were to retain command of the boat. I replied,
							in the same spirit, that that was out of the question, I being senior officer. He
							yielded the point personally, saying he was well aware of the fact, but that his
							orders (which he exhibited) were imperative. I explained that there was no probability
							of a conflict of authority, but that I could not yield my right to act, if there
							should be. He felt called upon to report the facts to his brigade commander, whereupon
							General McClernand's steamer came alongside and was made fast to ours. His <pb
								id="VAB1849-254" n="228"/> brigade commander came on board our boat, and wanted to
							know, "You know," and after some wordy demonstrations on his part, without effect,
							retired and reported to his chief, and I received an extremely polite note requesting
							that I would call upon him, with which I complied. I found General McClernand an
							exceedingly urbane and suave gentleman. He used all his power of persuasion to
							convince me that the boat was his, having first been occupied by his troops. I
							explained that I had no personal feeling in the matter; that there was very little
							probability of a conflict of authority, but that he had failed to give any sufficient
							reason why the king should take the ace in this game. Whereupon he very peremptorily
							called for his clerk, and dictated a written order that I should relinquish command;
							to which I replied that I was not aware that I was subject to his orders; that I
							represented my division commander, and should feel compelled to disregard his order,
							unless it came through my commanding officer. Thereupon he asked that I would show my
							division commander the order. When opportunity offered, I did so. General Hurlbut
							wrote across the face of it: "Countermanded by superior officer." When shown to the
							inferior officer, he swore a blue streak, and at once sat down without his clerk and
							wrote--well, what tended towards "pistols and coffee for two." By this time, however,
							we were at Savannah, and would in a few hours be at our destination. The matter was
							not further pressed, and we landed without bloodshed.</p>
						<p>When the war broke out, General McClernand was in Congress. A brigadier's commission
							was at his acceptance. <pb id="VAB1849-255" n="229"/> He was an Illinois man; and did
							not Illinois own the President, together with all that that implied? No braver men or
							more capable officers were found in the armies. Of course they were justly proud.
							General McClernand was as fiery and impetuous as Hotspur, and was a commander of much
							ability; and he merited far greater credit for our success at Donelson than was
							awarded him. On his part, he failed in giving credit due to troops of other divisions
							that aided him at a critical time. General McClernand was a gallant soldier
							nevertheless. He was the only officer seen at that day dressed in splendid
							regimentals--epauletted--Wellington boots, gold spurs, gauntleted hands, and
							equipments to match. He sat his war horse--a blooded stallion--like a Centaur, and
							managed his charger with the ease and grace of a Bayard; with his commanding presence,
							"the observed of all observers," while the General commanding the Army might have been
							mistaken for a slovenly-dressed Major of an Illinois regiment. I rode to him, and
							saluted profoundly. "General, are we to have a fight here?" "A fight here! Yes, the
							greatest battle ever fought on this continent; they will fight us like h--l." A true
							prophet.</p>

							<hi rend="sc">SHILOH.</hi></head>

						<p>U<hi rend="sc">PON</hi> disembarking, our fourth division, General Hurlbut
							commanding, moved out about two miles from the Landing, and went into camp. Here we
							spent some weeks, enjoying the beautiful March weather, warm and balmy as May, giving
							little thought to the enemy. General Grant held a grand review of his troops, thus
							breaking the monotony of camp life. On Friday eve, April 4th, we were aroused from our
							quiet repose, and pushed rapidly to the front to meet the enemy. This proved a
							reconnoisance in force. They drove in our pickets, learned our position, and after
							some skirmishing withdrew. Our division returned to camp, to resume our lazy life,
							little dreaming we were to be awakened to the feast of horrors preparing for us by
							this same enemy who had just knocked at our door.</p>
						<p>Early on Sunday morning following, April 6th, the "long roll" called us to arms. We
							were soon in rank, ready for "forward to meet the enemy." General Hurlbut sent part of
							our 4th division to General Sherman's aid. With the 1st and 3d brigades we moved
							forward at about 7:30 <hi rend="sc">A</hi>. <hi rend="sc">M</hi>., and had gone but a
							little distance before meeting General Prentiss's regiments rushing back from the
							front pell-mell, holding up their gory hands, shouting: "You'll catch it!--we are all
							cut to pieces--the rebels are coming." Passing by these <pb id="VAB1849-257" n="231"/>
							panic-stricken wretches without a reply--except the one incident related by Major
							Rerick of Lieutenant Hodges --or with muttered curses at their cowardice, we marched
							on, the men setting their teeth hard and grasping their guns more firmly, feeling for
							their cartridge-boxes, to be sure they were prepared to meet this victorious enemy and
							welcome him "with bloody hands to hospitable graves."</p>
						<p>It is past finding out why, but it is a fact well understood, that soldiers once
							panic-stricken are worthless-- they do not recover during that battle at least, if
							ever entirely, from their fright. Some of these men of Prentiss's division were
							brought back to where we were fighting the enemy, but they acted like a flock of
							frightened sheep, ready to start in any direction. At first one of them crept up to a
							large tree standing near our line of battle. Gradually others followed, until a line
							like the tail of a kite extended back some thirty or forty feet, each clutching the
							one in front in an agony of fear. Their Captain walked hurriedly up and down near
							them, unable to control himself, much less them. I talked with him quietly; asked him
							if he could not get his men to use their muskets on the enemy; that if they became
							engaged they would forget their fear. To no purpose. These men were not "native to the
							manor born." They soon after left us--perhaps to swell the crowd at the Landing, of
							which so much was made by Buell and his army.</p>
						<p>These men were not really greater cowards than others. The fault was not theirs. It
							belonged higher up--in placing raw troops where they could be pounced <pb
								id="VAB1849-258" n="232"/> down upon, as were these, without a shovelful of earth or
							a tree felled for protection. Donelson should have taught us better. All were green
							alike, from private in the ranks to General-in-Chief of all the Armies, and had to
							learn the art of war from actual experience in the field. I saw General Prentiss in
							rear of our line, clamoring for he knew not what--the line to be pushed forward to his
							former position, etc. He was as demoralized as his troops. He rode off to the front
							with his staff, to be captured--and was.</p>
						<p>I have been led off, and left my Regiment on the way to the battle-field. We went
							forward about a mile, and formed our line of battle a short distance in rear of
							General Prentiss's camp, the left wing of the 44th reaching to "Peach Orchard." Our
							line was formed along a country road. In our front were bushes and saplings, with a
							few trees of large size scattered here and there. We were soon fiercely attacked with
							musketry. The enemy charged up to within a few rods of our line, and were repulsed
							with heavy loss. After some delay they again renewed the attack, and charged up to
							within a few yards, and were again driven off. The musketry firing here was as fierce
							and continuous as any during the battle; the brush and small saplings were cut off by
							bullets, giving it somewhat the appearance of a Southern corn-field that had been
							topped, as is the custom there. Our men fought as coolly and effectively as if it had
							always been their occupation. They required no urging. I found it irksome enough
							sitting on my horse with nothing to do but be shot at. It was a curious study to note
							the manners of the different officers.</p>



						<pb id="VAB1849-259" n="233"/>

						<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Stoughton sat his horse like a statue, neither swerving right nor
							left, keeping his face to the front, as if his only thought was to be shot with his
							face to the enemy.</p>
						<p>Captain Heath (acting Major) was all movement. He could not be still. He rode up and
							down the line, at times, as fast as his horse would carry him. If an order was to be
							repeated, it did him much good to cry it along the line.</p>
						<p>Captain Williams kept up his martial bearing, moving with a more stately step than
							was his wont, trim and erect, grasping his sword with a firm hand. If he was to be
							killed, he wanted it done "with his martial cloak around him." This was his first
							battle-field, and he displayed great gallantry.</p>
						<p>Captain Cosgrove looked as if devising some plan to get at the enemy to better
							advantage, as he stood near his men, ready for an emergency.</p>
						<p>Captain Tannehill wore a stolid, bull-dog expression. He was going to see that
							out.</p>
						<p>Captain Aldrich moved about from place to place in a quick, nervous way, to be sure
							that his men were doing their very best.</p>
						<p>Lieutenant Hodges, commanding Company I, looked on at his men with a cool,
							calculating manner which evinced that being shot did not enter into his calculations;
							it was the enemy he was after.</p>
						<p>Lieutenant Newman, commanding Company H, was active and energetic, wanted to be doing
							more, and would like to know what the enemy were about.</p>



						<pb id="VAB1849-260" n="234"/>


						<p>Acting Captain Weamer had probably a premonition of his fate. Every nerve quivered,
							but he never flinched. His moral courage was equal to the occasion. He stood to his
							post bravely to the end.</p>
						<p>Captain Murray was amongst his men, and looked as if he would have preferred a musket
							to his sword. His manner was more subdued. He may have been premonished also, as are
							very many men. He did his whole duty manfully to the last.</p>
						<p>Lieutenant Kinmont, commanding Company F, showed by his steady bearing that he could
							be relied on for determined action under all circumstances. He might have said "Git
							ep" instead of "Forward," but would have gone to the right place all the same.</p>
						<p>Second-Lieutenant Burge Smith, commanding Company A, looked as if he just wished he
							had something to do, as he towered over his Company like Saul among his brethren.</p>
						<p>All of these, as well as other commissioned officers, were too proud to follow the
							example of their men, who had been ordered to "fall and fire," but stood erect, facing
							the enemy.</p>
						<p>The men being fully occupied with their fighting, had no time for other thoughts.
							When one was hit he would quietly crawl back, or be helped to the rear by a comrade,
							into the hands of our Surgeons, who were at hand, exposed to the same bullets and as
							much interested as any in the fight.</p>
						<p>Surgeon Martin, excited and fiery, moved about in his quick, impetuous way, wanting
							his horse to be shot in <pb id="VAB1849-261" n="235"/> battle; while Assistant Surgeon
							Rerick was as cool and collected as if in his hospital. The only doubt he felt was
							whether he had not mistaken his calling. If he could have had his choice then, it
							would have been a sword or a musket, and in line with the foremost. There could not
							well be a greater contrast than these men presented. Dr. Martin was genial,
							demonstrative, full of sympathy. He would take off his coat, and go at the sick in
							such a way as to make them feel it a comfort to be in condition to have his help. He
							would give them a teaspoonful of calomel, to "respond the liver,"--a tablespoonful of
							jalap, "to respond the bowels;" if that did not fetch them, a pint of blood, to
							"respond the circulation." By this time, perhaps, they would fall into Dr. Rerick's
							hands, who would build them up, and tend upon them in his careful, considerate way,
							without any demonstration. That took longer to impress itself on the men; when done,
							it remained. But they let nothing interfere with their duty, and soon had their hands
							full.</p>
						<p>The enemy had enough at this point. After some delay they form in column and march
							forward over cleared ground called the Peach Orchard, on which our left wing rested.
							On they come with a quick step, in gallant style, without firing a gun, the stars and
							bars flaunting jauntily in the breeze--and I must admit it to be as bold and defiant a
							battle-flag as one could wish to meet in battle's stern array. I at once wheeled two
							companies of the left wing to the right, and when they had come within point-blank
							range, opened fire. Their ranks were mowed down as with a scythe. Yet on they come. It
							seemed almost barbarous to fire on brave men <pb id="VAB1849-262" n="236"/> pressing
							forward so heroically to the mouth of hell. But human nature could not longer endure
							it. They wavered, faced about at the word of command, and retired as if on parade.
							Bravely fought, my gallant foe, worthy of a better cause--my misguided countrymen!
							They had enough of the 1st and 3d brigades of the 4th division. We had fought them
							from 8:30 <hi rend="sc">A</hi>. <hi rend="sc">M</hi>. to 2 <hi rend="sc">P</hi>. <hi
								rend="sc">M</hi>., and beaten them in fair fight, gloriously.</p>
						<p>But now a pressing call for help comes from the left wing of our Army. Colonel
							Stuart's brigade had been driven in, thus leaving our flank exposed. Our 3d brigade,
							consisting of the 44th and 31st Indiana, the 17th Kentucky, with a small number of the
							25th Kentucky, and Willard's battery, were rapidly pushed half a mile to our left. We
							found the enemy marching to our rear. I here quote from General Hurlbut's official
							report:
							<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"In a few moments two Texan regiments crossed the ridge separating my line from
							Stuart's former one, while other troops also advanced. Willard's battery was thrown
							into position, under command of Lieutenant Wood, and opened fire with great effect on
							the two Lone Star flags, until his line of fire was obstructed by the charge of the 3d
							brigade, which, after delivering its fire with great steadiness, charged full up the
							hill, and drove the enemy three or four hundred yards."</p>
							</q>
							</p>
						<p>We then took position on the brow of the hill, this being on open ground, with here
							and there a large tree scattered over the field. The 44th Indiana and the 17th
							Kentucky, in all not to exceed a thousand men, (the 31st Indiana being in reserve,)
							fought the enemy for nearly three hours; this being by far the fiercest contest of the
							day. The enemy outnumbered us at least three <pb id="VAB1849-263" n="237"/> to one.
							Their tactics were altogether different from ours. While we stood in line of battle,
							they were marched about hither and yon at a lively step, in column, by companies.
							Their flags flaunting defiance, they would move forward as if to make a charge, wheel
							to right or left, march obliquely, or to the rear, face about, move forward, again
							form in line, and open fire. At no time were all deployed in line of battle, and yet
							some of their regiments were firing away at us almost continuously. Our flag was a
							target at which they fired persistently, and it was riddled with balls. Never was flag
							more heroically defended. Our color-bearer, A. P. Waterhouse, was soon wounded. It was
							borne by Michael Harrison, William Woodford, William Underwood, Augustus A. Galloway,
							William McNeal, John Keifer, Samuel B. Sweet (a boy of 17), James Riddle, James
							Nicodemus, Frank Baldwin, Sergt. I. N. Thomas, N. P. Lewis, Sergt. Samuel Havens, John
							Engle, Sergt. M. B. Willis, Joseph Anderson, George Roy, Sergt. O. Z. Rawson, Sergt.
							Alexander Kinmont, C. M. Thomas, Lewis Griffith, H. A. Lords, Sergt. John Ulam, Edwin
							Matthews, James M. Flutter, Ralph Goodrich, Owen Shaw, Joseph Reed, Marion McGinnis,
							Sergt. George W. Schell, Samuel Hartzell, Nicholas Ensley, Owen Shaw, Peter Stahl,
							Sergt. Nelson Mansfield, Randall Simmons, Henry Twitchel, J. B. Rowe, and Lieutenant
							Jacob Newman, all of whom were either killed or wounded.</p>
						<p>But I feel that I am doing injustice to other brave men in giving the names of any
							where all fought with equal valor. Never was greater bravery exhibited on a <pb
								id="VAB1849-264" n="238"/> . battle field. We lost fully one-third of our number in
							killed and wounded, in this battle. Officers and men "rallied round the flag" not only
							"once again" but again and again, well knowing it to be almost certain death or wounds
							they faced. At the bridge of Lodi, where Napoleon led his troops and carried the flag,
							to insure their passage to victory, was no greater act of heroism than was here
							displayed by these men.</p>
						<p>It may not be considered in good taste for me to say it--yet it is the truth,
							nevertheless--that our little brigade saved the day by their heroism on this
							battle-field. There were no other troops but these between the enemy and the Landing,
							which, had they reached, General Sherman and General McClernand would have had the
							enemy both in front and rear. Beauregard's boast, that he would water his horse in the
							Tennessee River at Pittsburg Landing that night, would have been fulfilled.</p>
						<p>This same enemy had driven Colonel Stuart's brigade from the field. We met them,
							flushed with success, drove back and held at bay thrice our numbers for nearly three
							hours, and when compelled to fall back, from lack of ammunition, we had taught them
							discretion. Their advance was slow and cautious, thereby giving the needed time for
							their reception.</p>
						<p>I will here quote from General Hurlbut's General Order No. 20, which is of course
							addressed to the 4th division--most of which, however, fought elsewhere-- and it
							should be understood to apply more particularly to our 3d brigade of the 4th division,
							who held the position on the left referred to:</p>

						<p>To return to our fighting. As Generals Hurlbut, Lauman, and myself were talking
							together about how we could get a supply of ammunition, the enemy's sharpshooters sent
							a volley about our ears. We looked in each other's eyes to note the effect, and moved
							each to his post.</p>
						<p>After the first opening of the battle here--from what cause I do not now
							remember--Willard's battery was silent. Neither did the enemy use artillery. It was a
							fair open-field fight, each force in plain view of the other; the enemy's movements
							giving interest to the scene. Our men lost all sense of danger, as they stood and
							deliberately fired. There was no disposition to get <pb id="VAB1849-266" n="240"/>
							down out of the way of bullets; and had we been amply supplied with them, we should
							have driven the enemy from the field. They were only held by consummate handling.</p>
						<p>I had, during a lull in the firing, ridden over to the left of our line, and found
							Colonel ------, as brave and efficient an officer as any in the Army, sitting with his
							back to a tree, just in rear of his line of battle, holding his horse by the bridle he
							jocularly exclaimed: "What in h--1 are you riding about in that way for? Do you want
							to be shot? Get down. You can see my men are all right." While I sat on my horse
							talking with him, he leaned over on his elbow--whiz!--a shot passed through the fleshy
							part of his arm. He sprang up, exclaiming: " There, you have got me shot." As his
							wound was being tied up with his handkerchief: "I will keep my face to the enemy
							hereafter. I thought those fellows were going to let me have time to rest a little."
							He was very proud of that "hit," after the battle was over.</p>
						<p>The 44th Indiana had already twice filled their cartridge boxes here, and had emptied
							them at the enemy; but now, our last cartridge gone, the 31st Indiana was ordered up
							from where it had been held in reserve up to this time, to take our place. We withdrew
							a short distance, to where the ammunition wagon stood. In hunting over the empty boxes
							the men found a few cartridges scattered about, giving to each man a few rounds. We
							were now ordered by General Hurlbut to a position further to the left--the enemy
							moving part of his force to his right, with the evident intention of <pb
								id="VAB1849-267" n="241"/> outflanking us, at the same time moving forward on our
							front. General Hurlbut, concluding his position no longer tenable, ordered the line to
							retire to a new position to our left and rear. The 44th acted as rear guard. After
							going a short distance our brigade commander, General Lauman, came to me and suggested
							that I form a line across the road by which the enemy were advancing; which was done,
							thus demonstrating to them that it was not a rout, and delayed their advance, giving
							our brigade time to reach their new position, when we again resumed our retrograde
							movement. The enemy advanced very slowly and cautiously, and when they made their
							attack we were fully prepared for them. Had they pushed forward rapidly it would
							undoubtedly have been disastrous, as there were no other troops than our small brigade
							between them and the Landing. This last stand therefore proved of the utmost
							importance. When they made their final attack they were not only repulsed, but driven
							back to where they started from in the morning, three miles distant, the shot and
							shell of the gunboats hurrying them on their way; and this is where General Nelson's
							division found them next morning about ten o'clock.</p>
						<p>Upon reaching our new position, where a battery of large guns was in position, our
							first thought was ammunition. Seeing an officer with stars on his shoulders moving
							slowly about, looking "grand, gloomy and peculiar," sitting on his horse instead of a
							"throne," I rode to him, touched my visor reverently, and inquired if he were able to
							direct me to where I could find ammunition. "No, sir," he replied, fiercely, <pb
								id="VAB1849-268" n="242"/> "nor do I believe you want ammunition, sir." I looked at
							him in astonishment, doubting his sanity, but made no reply, further than to ask his
							name. In the same angry tones: "It makes no difference, sir, but I am General Buell."
							Turning my horse about, I rode to where I now saw my men had found ammunition and were
							engaged in filling their cartridge-boxes. I joined them. There may have been an
							expression on my face that did not please General Buell. He again presents himself,
							apparently in a frenzy of wrath, and demands to know who I am and where I come from.
							My answer was as fierce and insulting as I could make it, in my anger. After many
							threats of what I had to expect, and retorts in no measured terms, intermixed with
							some strong Anglo-Saxon adjectives, he rode off, furious. Surgeon Martin, standing
							near, his eyes glaring with sympathetic indignation, exclaimed: "Who is that?--who is
							he?" When told: "General Buell! My God, he will have you shot. How could you talk to
							him in that way?" In a little time Buell returned with General Grant. Both of them sat
							on their horses looking at us while completing our task, forming our ranks and moving
							forward into line of battle. But nothing further was said then or afterwards.</p>
						<p>I will here quote from General Hurlbut's official report giving the final repulse of
							the enemy:
							<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"Perceiving that a heavy force was closing on the left between my left and
							the river, while heavy fire continued on the right and front, I ordered the line to
							fall back. The retreat was made quietly and steadily, and in good order. I had hoped
							to make a stand on the <pb id="VAB1849-269" n="243"/> line of my camp, but masses of
							the enemy were pressing rapidly on each flank, while their light artillery was closing
							up rapidly in the rear. On reaching the twenty-four pounder siege-guns in battery near
							the river, I again succeeded in forming line of battle in rear of the guns, and by
							direction of Major-General Grant I assumed command of all troops that came up. Broken
							regiments and disordered battalions came into line gradually upon my division." (It
							should be "part of my division," as stated elsewhere in his official report; the 2d
							brigade did not join us till 4:30 <hi rend="sc">A</hi>. <hi rend="sc">M.</hi>)</p>
						<p>"Major Cavender posted six of his twenty-pound pieces on my right, and I
							sent my Aid to establish the light artillery--all that could be found-on my left." * *
							* "Many gallant soldiers and brave officers rallied steadily on the new line. I passed
							to the right, and found myself in communication with General Sherman, and received his
							instructions. In a short time the enemy appeared on the crest of the ridge, led by the
							18th Louisiana, but were cut to pieces by the steady and murderous fire of the
							artillery." * * * * "General Sherman also was rapidly engaged, and after an artillery
							contest of some duration the enemy fell back." * * * * "I advanced my division one
							hundred yards to the front, threw out pickets, and officers and men bivouacked in a
							heavy storm of rain. About 12 <hi rend="sc">P</hi>. <hi rend="sc">M</hi>. [should be
							about 3 <hi rend="sc">A</hi>. <hi rend="sc">M</hi>.], General Nelson's leading columns
							passed my line and went to the front, and I called in my advanced guard. The remnant
							of my division was reunited, Colonel Veatch with the second brigade having joined me
							about half-past 4 <hi rend="sc">A</hi>. <hi rend="sc">M</hi>.</p></q></p>
						<p>This shows clearly that there were none of Buell's fresh troops engaged in this last
							defeat of the enemy on Sunday eve, as is claimed by General Buell in his official
							report. The 44th Indiana were in line of battle where they must have seen them had any
							come to our aid. None of his troops had crossed the river at the <pb id="VAB1849-270"
								n="244"/> close of the contest, which lasted but a short time. It was yet daylight
							when we moved to the front and took up our position for the night, placed our pickets,
							gathered brush on which we spread our horse blankets, with our saddles for pillows, we
							made the best disposition possible under the circumstances, to rest--sleep being out
							of the question in the pouring rain-storm. General Hurlbut and General Lauman spent
							the night with us. Many of the officers of the 44th Indiana were present. The events
							of the day were discussed. Our decisive defeat of the enemy was a subject for
							congratulation with all. The anticipated arrival of Buell's forces in the morning was
							a matter of interest talked over. No one dreamed that such a claim could be made.
							General Buell "lost his head." He could see nothing but "stragglers."</p>
						<p>About 3 o'clock <hi rend="sc">A</hi>. <hi rend="sc">M</hi>. General Nelson, with his
							staff, at the head of his column, advanced without giving a very definite account of
							himself, and the guards did not make a very intelligible report at headquarters. The
							tramp of horses being heard, General Hurlbut sprang up, went forward a short distance,
							and demanded "Who is invading my lines?" in very angry and emphatic tones, using some
							profane expletives at the same time. General Nelson, in much milder tones than was his
							habit, replied: "Be a little civil, General; I am General Nelson, with my division; I
							wish to establish my line on your right, and throw forward my pickets." This was the
							first appearance of General Buell's fresh troops on the battle-field of Shiloh, or any
							other, for that matter.</p>



						<pb id="VAB1849-271" n="245"/>


						<p>With daylight our stomachs reminded us that we had eaten nothing for twenty-four
							hours. How vividly my memory retains the taste of a drink of cold coffee taken from
							the canteen of General Lauman on this Monday morning (which his orderly had in some
							way procured). The traditional drink of hard cider that could not be bitten off, was
							nothing to biting that off. We now moved a short distance to the rear, and about 8 <hi
								rend="sc">A</hi>. <hi rend="sc">M</hi>. succeeded in getting some crackers, which,
							with coffee, was our preparation for a renewal of the conflict, after nearly twelve
							hours' fighting, and without sleep. With this moiety of food, the 44th Indiana was
							again on the march for the battle-field. The effort of will necessary to move men to
							such a task dwells in my memory as fresh and green as any superhuman effort is
							impressed on the mind ever after.</p>
						<p>The 44th Indiana and 17th Kentucky alone of our brigade responded to this call. With
							nearly one-half our number left dead on the battle-fields of the preceding day, or in
							hospital, both regiments did not exceed, all told, more than five hundred, worn, weary
							men. We resolutely turned our faces forward and took up our line of march for the
							front, to meet the enemy.</p>
						<p>We were led by a guide over a very rough country, for two or three miles, when we
							suddenly came upon the enemy charging upon and driving some of General McClernand's
							troops over a level, cleared field. The enemy were again in column by companies. The
							44th being in advance, were immediately deployed in line, and opened fire on their
							flank. They were taken by surprise, but returned our fire. Colonel McHenry <pb
								id="VAB1849-272" n="246"/> gallantly brought his men into line and opened fire. The
							enemy's battery opened upon us. After some time they began to fall back. Our men
							having lost all sense of fatigue, pushed them vigorously, and after pursuing them half
							a mile they disappeared in the woods, where their main force was posted. As our men
							had become much scattered, I called a halt and collected our force. General Lauman
							having been unhorsed at the first fire by a rebel bullet, was not with us. I soon saw
							General Sherman at a distance, and rode to him and reported. He ordered me to form
							line of battle in his immediate front and await further orders.</p>
						<p>General Hurlbut was engaged elsewhere, but I will quote what he says in his official
							report of our part here: "The third brigade was deeply and fiercely engaged on the
							right of General McClernand, successfully stopping a movement to flank his right, and
							holding their ground until the firing ceased."</p>
						<p>The position held by the enemy was in our front, in the woods, but a few hundred
							yards from Shiloh chapel, which has given name to the battle; with the Corinth road in
							their rear. This was the same position held by General Sherman when the battle opened
							on Sunday morning, and from which he was compelled to fall back. A cleared field
							intervened between the enemy and the position assigned us by General Sherman, which
							was in open ground, with the exception of a few large trees here and there, giving us
							a good view of our troops as they marched across the open field and into the dreaded
							woods, and also of the vicissitudes attending the fight.</p>



						<pb id="VAB1849-273" n="247"/>

						<p>A portion of BuelI's fresh troops had now arrived on the field, and moved forward to
							the attack, and we opened ranks for the 30th Indiana to march in. After a fierce and
							continuous musketry fight of about thirty minutes' duration, the enemy were driven
							from their position, and fell back on the Corinth road about a mile. Their main force
							had already been in full retreat for some hours--in fact since about ten o'clock in
							the morning; this, their last stand, being made to cover their retreat, ended the
							struggle. General Buell did not pursue the retreating foe, but at once ordered his
							fresh troops into camp.</p>
						<p>General Lauman now rejoined us. He had been unable to find a remount, and was thus
							detained until after the final withdrawal of the enemy. General Grant was soon seen
							riding along the lines, being loudly cheered by the troops, and we rode forward and
							added our congratulations; all of which was received by him with his usual taciturn,
							uncertain manner, without showing the least appearance of exultation.</p>
						<p>We now led our weary men back to our camps, for rest and refreshment, and never had
							men more richly earned this boon. We found them unmolested. My tent was in all
							respects as when I issued from it to meet the enemy on Sunday morning. The enemy had
							not occupied our camps, as has been erroneously stated, but after their final defeat
							on Sunday eve they were driven by the fire of the gunboats back to where they started
							from Sunday morning.</p>

						<head rend="center b">CHAPTER IV.</head>

						<p>N<hi rend="sc">EVER</hi> was battle so misunderstood by the public at large; never
							battle so systematically misrepresented, as was the battle of Shiloh. For many months
							General Buell, like his great prototype, the King of France, with his ten thousand
							men, had marched up the hill, and then marched down again, on Nolan's fork of Green
							River, Ky., patiently waiting for the rebels to get ready to evacuate Bowling Green,
							Ky. At last General Mitchell and Colonel Turchin, becoming impatient and restless,
							insisted upon giving them a push in the rear to hurry them out. When they arrived,
							however, it was too late. What could not be carried off, was smouldering piles that
							had once been army stores. After spending further time, General Buell leisurely
							marched his army within sound of our victorious guns at Fort Donelson, and then
							marched back again and took possession of Nashville, Tenn., which was evacuated by the
							enemy because of our victory at Donelson. Marching in on the heels of this bloodless
							victory, General Buell at once embraced the occasion to read his troops a lecture on
							"my policy," reiterating and enforcing what had long since become nauseous to the
							stomachs of his troops--that their chief duty was to protect rebel property, so that
							those of them who were absent in the rebel army fighting us might feel the comforting
							assurance that their property, families and friends at home were <pb id="VAB1849-275"
								n="249"/> in good hands, and would be free from molestation from the hated Yankees.
							A whole division has been known to be placed under arrest for burning a few rails to
							cook their coffee, while on the march to meet these same rebels in arms, to enforce
							this "policy." Details were ordered from regiments, after marching all day, to stand
							guard all night over rebels' houses, that the inmates should not have their slumbers
							disturbed by the weary, foot-sore soldiers getting a drink of water from the well at
							the door.</p>
						<p>This was the Colossus that came with his army the day after the battle, and boasted,
							"I came, I saw, I conquered." This man, who had never seen a battle--whose time and
							mind were wholly given to the care and protection of rebels, their slave property
							being in his eyes more inviolable than the sanctuary--could find nothing on his
							arrival but "fugitives, panic-stricken stragglers; the banks swarmed with a confused
							mass of men of various regiments; there could not have been less than four or five
							thousand." Yes, there was somewhere about that number of our wounded sent to the
							Landing. That there were "panic stricken stragglers" congregated at this point, is not
							denied. But this, as is well known, is an attendant on all great battles.</p>
						<p>The enemy had been defeated, as I have shown, on Sunday evening, and were driven back
							to General Prentiss's position, from whence they started Sunday morning. Here General
							Buell's fresh troops found this beaten, worn-out enemy, who had fought us for twelve
							hours the previous day, without food or rest.</p>
						<p>Let any soldier who was there on both days, or in any similar battle elsewhere, say
							what the difference is <pb id="VAB1849-276" n="250"/> between meeting this enemy in
							their then condition, and in fighting these same troops fresh, organized and equipped
							especially for this great battle, which they had bravely fought and lost on the
							preceding day. I repeat, let any one--soldier or citizen--judge.</p>
						<p>Beauregard commenced to withdraw his forces when he found Buell's army had arrived.
							The positions he held had this end in view.</p>
						<p>That Buell's army did help to drive the enemy off the field is true, but what can be
							said in extenuation of only driving him off? A competent commander would have pursued
							and captured five thousand prisoners of this beaten, demoralized, fleeing enemy, and
							all his artillery.</p>
						<p>The time has long since come when the truth of the history of this battle should be
							vindicated. General Grant was in no position to demand justice for his army that
							fought and won the battle of Shiloh. He was soon in disgrace--deprived of his
							command--all his thoughts given to extricating himself from the consequences of his
							blunders. General Grant had this merit, and a most important one: he profited by his
							blunders, and in contradistinction from Don Carlos Buell, he did place his troops
							where they would have to fight.</p>
						<p>General Sherman has somewhere said that this was a rough and tumble fight, that
							tested the muscle of the raw troops there engaged, and was useful in developing their
							pluck. (I mean only to give the substance, from memory.) I think this might also be
							applied to general officers, as it is well known that General Sherman was tumbled
							about some--but his pluck always brought <pb id="VAB1849-277" n="251"/> him out
							uppermost. I will ask if he found any such tussle on his pleasure trip "to the sea,"
							of which so much is boasted in song and story? It is true he left "Pap" Thomas in his
							rear to take care of the rebel army, and General Grant in his front to keep them fully
							occupied. This trip had this merit, if no other: it was a "bummers' " paradise, and
							differed in this respect from Buell's "policy." I join in the chorus of praise.</p>
						<p>With the help of Lew. Wallace's loitering division, which arrived on the field Sunday
							night, we could have dispensed with General Buell's army altogether. But I have no
							intention or wish to deny them all the credit due for their part on Monday.</p>
						<p>Of course all of Buell's army had to fight their way through "the horde of
							panic-stricken stragglers" that beset them at the Landing, and this might have misled
							same of them into the belief that it was the rebels who were there Sunday evening; but
							this could hardly be. And yet the pertinacity with which they cling to the
							"stragglers" is wonderful. Even to this day the first utterance of any of these men,
							if Shiloh is but mentioned, is "stragglers." But now one of them says he sternly
							invited them out to see <hi rend="i">men</hi> fight, as he fought them off from
							clinging to his skirts for protection. I don't know how many were drowned; but I can't
							tell how these "stragglers" could swim in the condition he describes them, when forced
							into the river, they so assailed him with their dismal cries for help.</p>
						<p>It may be asked, were there no "panic-stricken stragglers" among all these gallant
							regiments of Buell's? <pb id="VAB1849-278" n="252"/> No, not one,--if you are to
							believe the official reports of his regimental, brigade and division commanders.</p>
						<p>I will yet venture upon giving a little incident that happened immediately under my
							own eye. A very gallant regiment, that wanted to make a bayonet charge, moved forward
							in splendid style; but it "got a little squeezed," and came out at the first fire. No
							men in Sunday's battle were ever half so utterly panic-stricken. The agony of fear
							exhibited is beyond description. A perfect Babel of tongues--cries, groans--throwing
							themselves upon the ground in desperation of fear. The bugler was beset to make the
							calls to drown their cries, but he could not make a toot. In his vain endeavor he fell
							over against the root of a tree, exhausted by his effort. With contortions and cries
							that would have shamed the geese whose squall saved Rome, they were only recalled to
							consciousness by the peal of derisive laughter from our line that greeted this
							grotesque exhibition. Never was such a shout of boisterous mirth before heard on a
							battle-field. This ridicule alone enabled their Colonel to lead them off the field and
							away from danger, and hide them in the thick woods. They saw the enemy no more. You
							will say they were in disgrace, of course. No such thing. This regiment was as highly
							commended as were all others in official reports of the commanding officers.</p>
						<p>I happened upon this same regiment next morning, in passing. It was drawn up as on
							dress parade. Its length of line would have excited the envy of any Colonel in the
							armies, and it was composed of good, rugged, soldierly-looking men too, and they were
							evidently <pb id="VAB1849-279" n="253"/> well drilled. Probably most of them had been
							accustomed to military drill from their youth, and may have seen service. As I passed
							by, their Colonel, with tears in his voice, was talking to them "like a Dutch uncle."
							From the hasty glance I cast along his line, I judged his reproaches had little
							effect. All the posthumous glory in the world was as nothing to being where they
							were--in capital condition, equal to their rations any day. Contrition? No. Indeed I
							rather expected to hear them shout in chorus: "He that fights and runs away, lives to
							fight another day."</p>
						<p>The Colonel of this regiment was a brave man, a brilliant officer, and a genial,
							kind-hearted gentleman, but I could not altogether suppress a smile when my
							appearance, like Banquo's ghost, suddenly interrupted the recital of "hair-breadth
							'scapes by flood and field" that was being poured into the ears of the loyal
							governor's representatives, who had come from home with congratulations and good
							cheer. He looked "Thou canst not say I did it." He had his reward. These men fought
							well and faithfully afterwards, and the incident is given here simply to show that
							"the panic-stricken stragglers" belonged to both armies alike, and was the exception,
							as were the panic-stricken men of Grant's army, who had far greater cause.</p>
						<p>Apropos to nothing, the hero of the Franco-German war, Baron von Moltke, scorned
							making a comparison between the fighting qualities of his finely-drilled troops and
							"the undisciplined mob" that fought four years for the preservation of their
							country--and conquered a peace. Query: Did Louis Napoleon's malign influence <pb
								id="VAB1849-280" n="254"/> so utterly demoralize the French nation, or were his
							generals subsidized by influences similar to those which governed an exceedingly small
							number of ours?</p>
						<p>Buell's army was composed of as brave men and gallant soldiers as wore the uniform.
							But the malign influence at their head overshadowed and crushed them. General Buell,
							with his arrogance, could no more comprehend what was due to brave men who had
							voluntarily come out to fight their country's battles, prompted by patriotism alone,
							than he comprehended what true loyalty to his government meant. His troops had been
							marched up hill and down so long, that the first fight, --like the first baby, always
							wonderful,--human nature could not be expected to resist blazoning their achievements
							to the world in all the splendor of the newly risen sun.</p>
						<p>The battle over, the immense number of wounded required an army of surgeons. Many
							young doctors, among others, were sent from home to help care for them, and, with the
							best intentions, their want of practical knowledge left much to wish for. One was
							reminded of a synod, conference or other gathering of church dignitaries, where the
							wise old heads performed the work, and left the fledglings to put on airs--to be
							petted by, and amuse themselves with the ladies.</p>
						<p>A day or two after the battle, I went on board a steamer filled with wounded men.
							Very many of them were wandering aimlessly about over the boat, presenting ing a most
							ghastly appearance, their wounds having been tied up hurriedly, the blood and grime of
							battle being left to be removed at a more convenient season.</p>



						<pb id="VAB1849-281" n="255"/>

						<p>It had been the understanding that the boat was to leave with its living freight at
							an earlier date. I do not now remember why it was detained. The floor of the cabin was
							filled with those most dangerously wounded, lying on pallets. Among these I found my
							friend and fellow townsman, Colonel S. S. Bass, of the 30th Indiana, who told me that
							his wound had not as yet been examined by a surgeon. He was cheerful, and felt
							confident that in a few weeks he would again be fit to return to his regiment. I
							questioned him particularly, and examined his wound. He pointed out where he thought
							he could feel the ball, and said if the surgeon would cut in there it could be easily
							extracted; that done, he would soon be well again. While not sharing his hopes fully,
							I talked cheerfully, telling him he could take a furlough of some months for a less
							hurt. Our last meeting had been on the battle-field, on Monday afternoon, when he, at
							the head of his regiment, passed through our ranks to engage in the final struggle of
							the day. He now told me that he had received his wound very soon after entering the
							fight, had ridden off the field, and had been taken by ambulance to the boat where he
							then was. After some time spent with him, I left him, with the promise that if it were
							possible to find a head to the boat, he should have a state-room, where he would be
							more comfortable. He did not share my hopes of success in this endeavor. I hunted over
							the boat in vain for one in authority. The invariable answer from subordinates and
							others attached to the boat was: "The state-rooms are all filled; there is no room for
							more; we are doing all we can." "Where <pb id="VAB1849-282" n="256"/> are the
							surgeons?" "I can't tell; you will find them somewhere about." I returned to my
							friend, who smiled at my heat and indignation, and silently pointed to his
							fellow-sufferers. After a little while a young doctor came into the cabin, looked
							along the rows of prostrate forms, moved down the space between them, occasionally
							stopped, removed a cloth from a wound, replaced it, and moved on. When he came to
							Colonel Bass he made a more decided stop. Daintily removing a cloth as large as my
							hand, he looked at the wound a moment, and replaced it without a word. To my inquiries
							he replied that he was not in charge--that some one else (giving the name) would give
							the needed attention soon--thought it impossible that a state-room could be had--and
							passed on. After doing all that was possible to supply his wants in every way, I left
							Colonel Bass, telling him I would bring one of our surgeons to examine his wound and
								<hi rend="i">demand</hi> a state-room. He thought it hardly worth while--that he
							would get along all right when he got to Paducah. After some unavoidable delay I found
							our surgeon, Dr. Martin. When we got back to the Landing the boat was gone. But a few
							days after, I heard of his death at Paducah.</p>
						<p>Our surgeons devoted themselves to the care of the wounded day and night, without
							thought of self, the consciousness of doing their duty alone supporting them through
							their labors. Soon after, Surgeon Rerick's health gave way. When I saw him in an
							ambulance, completely broken down, being conveyed to a steamer, I said to myself:
							"That is the last I shall see of our brave surgeon." But no. He returns, a mere
							skeleton <pb id="VAB1849-283" n="257"/> in appearance. I could not greet him as
							cordially as he so richly merited, for thinking: " Why <hi rend="i">did</hi> you come
							back here to die!" In this I was mistaken, however. There are yet, I hope, many years
							of work left for him to do.</p>
						<p>I feel inclined to give here some extracts from a few of the many letters of
							prominent citizens of Fort Wayne, giving the estimate held at that time of the
							services of the Forty-fourth.</p>

										<p>C<hi rend="sc">OLONEL</hi> R<hi rend="sc">EED</hi>,--I feel like tendering to
											the 44th my hearty thanks for the glorious part taken by it in this battle
											(Shiloh) and the Donelson fight, by which every citizen of the county and the
											district has been honored. When I think of the peril of our cause and our
											Government, indeed, at Pittsburg Landing, and the narrow escape we made only
											through the bravery of our troops, I am almost overcome with emotion. It may
											be unmanly, but I confess to you that I have shed tears of joy * * * my heart
											melts with gratitude to the brave men * * * and with gratitude to God, who
											overrules all, for the heroism with which they received and withstood the
											shock of the traitorous hosts. I can understand now better than ever before
											why it is that military heroes are so honored by the majority of men. It is
											right. It is honorable to our human nature that men who leave their quiet
											homes * * * and place themselves in the breach, and save their country by
											exposing themselves to such danger as this, should be honored."</p>

						<p>Another:
							<q rend="blockquote">
							<p>"Indiana soldiers generally have a proud reputation throughout the country,
							and I think it is no exaggeration to say the 44th now stands No. 1 of the list. With
							pride I recall all their unprecedented deeds of heroism <pb id="VAB1849-284" n="258"/>
							in the late battle. With tears I mourn the sacrifice of so many heroes. All honor to
							the living and dead."</p></q></p>
						<p>Yet one more:
						<q rend="blockquote">
							<p>" * * * I will embrace it, to return to the noble 44th. My most sincere thanks for
							the distinguished service rendered in the terrible battle of Pittsburg Landing. It was
							a terrible ordeal that you were called to pass through; but, thank God, the officers
							and men showed themselves equal to the emergency. The praise of the regiment is in the
							mouth and upon the tongue of every man, woman and child in the county. * * * The 44th
							ought to be recruited, * * * but all seem fully impressed * * * that going into the
							service means something more than being dressed in uniform, drawing rations, and
							living in a tent. * * * The return of quite a number of your wounded men serves to
							give an inkling of the stern realities of war."</p></q></p>
						<p>Enough. "Those scraps are good deeds past--forgotten as soon as done." <hi rend="i"
								>Ita est.</hi></p>
						<p>I shall have to leave the other side of the medal covered until a more fitting
							opportunity for singing the praises of "the martyred General" Milligan and his ghostly
							heroes, drilling by starlight, with traitorous thoughts intent--nor fife nor drum to
							quicken their steps and aid their fast-oozing courage while marching to the music of
							the wind--start in alarm at the watchdog's honest bark. Hist! What's that? Away! The
							moon is up! Scatter! Where are these heroes now?</p>
						<p>I would gladly, if time and space permitted, dwell at more length upon the scenes
							that cling to memory with a halo, from contrast with excitement of a different kind.
							Pittsburg Landing presented the most stirring appearance. The eyes of the Nation were
							directed to this <pb id="VAB1849-285" n="259"/> one point. Immense crowds flocked
							hither from all over the broad land. Steamers loaded with all that our army craved,
							from our long abstinence from civilized comforts, were pushing their way through those
							already there, crowding the river fuller with shipping than New York harbor at the
							busiest season. When a fresh arrival was sighted there was a rush to be the first to
							board her, to secure the longed-for prize, either eatable or drinkable. What a
							scramble I made over the decks of a score of intervening boats, accompanied by Major
							Stoughton, Captains Williams, Heath, and others, to be the first to reach the deck of
							a steamer just arrived on the outer line of boats--the objective point a barrel of
							lager! The "charge of the light brigade" was tame in comparison. <hi rend="i">We</hi>
							had the advance, and our charge successful,--and it cost dear--in cash. We bore off in
							triumph two half-barrels, which were on tap as soon as the bank was reached, and drunk
							to the health of all good fellows by the men of the Forty-fourth fortunate enough to
							be present. A toast to our wounded recalled us in time. The second cask was at once
							hurried off, and reserved for their benefit. Whose pen can describe the difference in
							taste of <hi rend="i">that</hi> lager and the glass you deliberately walk up to the
							counter--drink--and lay down five cents?</p>
						<p>I have failed to relate at the right time an incident which has a place in my
							recollection, and I will give it here. One day, while we were yet at Camp Allen, a
							splendid war-horse, caparisoned to correspond, was led into camp. My courage, like Bob
							Acres', oozed out <pb id="VAB1849-286" n="260"/> at the palms of my hands as I looked
							upon him, but I had to face the music. The charger was presented in due form, as a
							fitting testimonial, etc., etc., from my friends, Hon. Samuel Hanna and Samuel H.
							Shoaff, Esq., of Fort Wayne. How I ever got through the trying ordeal is more than I
							can tell; but to mount and display him to the gaze of the admiring on-lookers was the
							feather that broke the camel's back--impossible.</p>
						<p>When at Donelson, my friend Surgeon Martin had a fine large black horse, that he very
							much wished to have wounded in battle. As I did not want my horse shot, I yielded to
							his solicitation, and exchanged horses with him for the time being. His horse was not
							shot; while mine, in the excitement attending our first battle, was ridden about so
							furiously that my orderly, Andrew Jackson Strohl "Dad," "resigned" on the spot, when
							the horse was delivered to his care. With tears he swore the horse might go to the
							devil,--and he did.</p>
						<p>In giving my recollections as I have, without definite plan, or giving to them other
							consideration than I do while writing, I find that many incidents long forgotten come
							back to memory, which I should like to relate if space permitted. As we go forward in
							life, our earliest impressions grow brighter as we recede from them.</p>
						<p>Just now, what transpired while we were yet at Camp Allen stands out as on printed
							page. Our lamented Lieutenant-Colonel, Baldwin J. Crossthwaite, to whom the regiment
							owed the proficiency it acquired in drill, <pb id="VAB1849-287" n="261"/> returns to
							life, and is before me in plain view while he marshals his regiment in the intricate
							evolutions so imposing to the uninitiated. He had served as officer of cavalry in the
							Mexican war, and was an able tactician, whose knowledge of the details of army life
							was of the greatest benefit to us. He had brought with him from Mexico a disease that
							would have prevented most men from attempting service again, but his patriotism led
							him to disregard his own comfort and health; he chose rather to sacrifice his life in
							his country's cause. He died at his home in Angola, while our guns were thundering at
							the gates of Donelson--a fit requiem for so true a soldier and patriot. His memory is
							cherished in the hearts of the brave men who honored him for his many virtues.</p>
						<p>The Hon. Charles Case had represented our district two terms in Congress. He used all
							his large influence and ability in the furtherance of his country's cause. He took the
							position of Adjutant of the 44th, to fit himself, by actual service in the field, for
							higher and more important duties. In pursuance of this, he soon accepted a position on
							the brigade staff. His health gave way, from exposure at Donelson; and while at his
							home on sick leave he was commissioned Major of a cavalry regiment, and soon after was
							commissioned Colonel of the 129th Indiana.</p>
						<p>Our Chaplain, Dr. Green C. Beeks, at the time of his acceptance of the chaplaincy,
							was presiding elder of Fort Wayne circuit. As an eloquent preacher his prominence gave
							him much influence, which he used in the enlistment of men for the regiment. Having
							been formerly <pb id="VAB1849-288" n="262"/> a practicing physician, his knowledge and
							skill rendered his services valuable at all times. He was with us at Donelson, and
							devoted himself energetically to the care of our wounded. He accompanied the regiment
							to Pittsburg Landing, was taken sick on the way up the river, and sent to the
							hospital, thence to his home, where he lay at death's door for many months. His health
							was so much impaired that upon his return to his regiment he found himself unequal to
							the duties of his position, and resigned his commission and returned to his home at
							Fort Wayne.</p>
						<p>George W. McConnell, Esq., of Angola, Steuben County, was a gentleman of high
							standing, who accepted the position of Quartermaster of the 44th, and used his best
							efforts for the good of his country by devoting himself to the health and comfort of
							the men of the regiment with untiring zeal. Upon our getting fairly under way in the
							field, he resigned his commission, in February, 1862. He is remembered with the
							kindliest feelings of regard by all.</p>
						<p>But I must hurry on. I find that I have more than filled the space allotted me, and I
							much fear that, in traveling over the same ground as our Historian, I have been
							repeating what has already been far better rendered. I wish much to add a short
							chapter on the "Siege of Corinth," and then bid a long farewell to the "Iron Men" of
							the 44th Indiana.</p>

						<head rend="center b">CHAPTER V.</head>

						<p>G<hi rend="sc">ENERAL</hi> B<hi rend="sc">UELL</hi> had not forgotten us, and did not
							fail to reclaim the regiments of our brigade. I was ordered to report to him, which I
							at once did in person. I found him a solidly-built, soldierly-looking martinet of
							about 5 feet 7; shoulders well back, breast thrown out, head erect--in feeling, an
							embryo Napoleon. I was referred to his chief of staff, and by him directed to report
							to our former division commander. General Thomas L. Crittenden was a true Kentucky
							gentleman, every inch a soldier--plain, straightforward and unpretending, his only
							thought being to do his whole duty to his country. He esteemed every brave man as a
							friend and comrade. I have known of his telling his chief of staff that he deserved to
							be shot, for marching his troops an unnecessary long distance on a blistering day, the
							hot southern sun heating our rifles so as to be almost unbearable to the touch. His
							sympathies were with the men, to whose care and comfort he devoted himself without
							stint. Himself and family were looked upon with the warmest feelings of regard by all
							his soldiers. They moved amongst us like the patriarchs of old, their presence giving
							a home and kindred feeling to all. In battle he was a Saladin,--with his only child--a
							boy of some seven years--on his horse behind him, he would have cut his way with his
							good sword through a host.</p>



						<pb id="VAB1849-290" n="264"/>



						<p>General Buell took exceeding good care to provide for us a brigade commander after
							his own heart. General Von Blank was a West Pointer. A man of sedate and sober aspect,
							exceeding tall and gaunt; his length of leg greatly out of proportion to the trunk--
							dangling about, when mounted, in a supple jack fashion. His face was small and sharp,
							his lower jaw receding; but his prominent, peaked chin made amends for this evidence
							of indecision. To be soldierly, he chewed tobacco in a feeble way. His eyes were small
							and faded, gray in color, and covered with large, gleaming spectacles. When he looked
							at you while speaking, your mind was so distracted by trying to decide to what to
							compare him, it was difficult to understand what he was saying. As he ambled around on
							his fat horse, he was as a whole an object fearfully and wonderfully made up. The
							"boys" very irreverently called him "Old Double Eye."</p>
						<p>He had, from some sort of conscientious scruples about fighting, as he said, resigned
							his commission in the army rather than take part in the Mexican war. Afterwards his
							conscience had given him so many twinges for dishonoring his country's draft for the
							debt he owed it, that he had resolved to wipe it out now,--and here he was, in all his
							glory. It goes without saying, that he was an immense tactician, but his specialty was
							"orders."</p>
						<p>He soon set himself about organizing a school for the instruction of his Colonels in
							all the lore he had imbibed. An order was promulgated that each and every Colonel
							appear at brigade headquarters at 7 <hi rend="sc">P</hi>. <hi rend="sc">M</hi>. <pb
								id="VAB1849-291" n="265"/> sharp. This, as a matter of imminent peril, was discussed
							in committee of the whole. One of the Colonels had in other days commanded a brigade.
							He felt the indignity deeply. To be called upon to attend school--and night school at
							that--and be put through his paces by this "slab-sided dotard," was a little too much.
							Another of the Colonels had for years "taught the young idea how to shoot." To be
							thrust back into a pupil,--would see him d--- hanged, first! The other two, being of
							more pliable natures, and not having had the same advantages, reported as directed.
							The General, with imposing deliberation, opened school by placing himself at his camp
							desk with book in hand, and demanded what we knew of the recusants. We smoothed down
							his ruffled mane with assurances of their presenting themselves on a future evening.
							We soon got in accord when we found the General relied upon his tactics entirely, and
							was easily led to read the whole question and answer to us. Our report led the other
							Colonels to reconsider their determination, and we presented ourselves in a body. The
							General's digestion was at fault, probably,--after a time he propounded a difficult
							problem that we professed our inability to demonstrate, and asked that he would
							expound for us. The General looked wise, adjusted his glasses, read, but could not
							find the right place--commenced again, got confused, blundered. School closed. Other
							duties prevented a re-opening.</p>
						<p>On April 22, 1862, we left our camp, where we had so long remained, and around which
							so many memories clustered, and moved forward three miles and reported <pb
								id="VAB1849-292" n="266"/> to General Crittenden. From this time forward we were
							almost constantly in front and on picket duty, and skirmishing with the enemy,
							changing camp almost daily, constructing roads, cutting down timber, building bridges,
							throwing up entrenchments, etc., had but a tithe of which been done while we were
							doing nothing but waiting for the enemy to attack us at Pittsburg Landing, our
							position would have been impregnable, while now there was as little use of all this
							wasted labor, our heavy picket line being three to four miles in advance, and almost
							continuously fighting as the enemy were slowly driven back. When we had arrived within
							six miles of Corinth there was immense artillery firing; heavy siege guns were got
							into position on eminences, and thundered away at space. The black-bearded, short and
							stout General P. would climb a tree or some other elevation, and with a field-glass at
							his eye scan the enemy's earthworks, six miles away, to decide whether a breach was
							made. This booming of big guns came to be a lullaby to which the men would fall asleep
							as quietly as a babe on its mother's lap. At other times we were called into line of
							battle half a dozen times a day, during which time there would perhaps be fierce
							skirmishing, as the enemy were gradually, inch by inch, driven back; and at no time
							was there any good reason why we should not have moved forward to within point blank
							range of our siege guns and opened fire upon their works and at the town of Corinth,
							unless it might have been in deference to the wish of General Buell that the rebels
							should not be hurried too much. Almost every day afforded us the amusement of throwing
							up <pb id="VAB1849-293" n="267"/> breastworks and skirmishing, while the rebels were
							making up their minds which way they should go.</p>
						<p>May 30th we were on picket at an old log meeting-house on the main Corinth road, when
							explosions and dense clouds of smoke and dust within the enemy's fortifications
							indicated evacuation. I rode forward within plain view, could see no guns or troops,
							and returned and informed General Crittenden. Next day we occupied the camp of the
							19th Louisiana, in Corinth.</p>
						<p>June 4th we marched, with three days' rations in our haversacks, following the
							rebels' line of retreat as far as Booneville, Mississippi. We returned by way of Iuka,
							stopping here until June 14th, when we took up our line of march for Florence. We went
							into camp on the Tennessee River near Tuscumbia, where we spent some time, while our
							army was building block-houses and other fortifications, from Mississippi to Georgia;
							thence to Athens, Huntsville, and to the Tennessee River at the corner of the three
							States of Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee, and went into camp at the junction of a
							little stream called Battle Creek with the Tennessee River, a few miles west of
							Chattanooga.</p>
						<p>While on this long, weary march under the scorching rays of the southern sun--a cloud
							of dust following us by day, and all manner of creeping things to annoy us at
							night--the men would manage to pick up some crumbs of comfort, in spite of the
							surveillance of "Double Eye" or Don Carlos, who rode from rear to front with his
							staff, and did not fail to note any irregularities as he passed. One day: "Colonel, I
							see many <pb id="VAB1849-294" n="268"/> of your sergeants without their guns. Why is
							this?" "They are in command of their companies." "Where are the company officers?"
							"Killed or wounded in battle." "They should carry their guns instead of a sword." "Am
							I to consider that an order?" After evading a direct reply for a time, he finally said
							"No," and passed on.</p>
						<p>Among the hills and in the hollows, all over the South, are ragged nooks where the
							scouts and "bummers" knew by instinct apple-jack, peach and bourbon must grow, in the
							nature of things, and of course must somehow be unearthed from its caché. Canteens
							were very handy. If one was thirsting for a drink of water, and asked one of the men
							for his canteen, he would say, "Haven't any," and would call out for a canteen of
							water to be sent to the front. After some delay some one in the rear would pass
							forward his canteen. When put to your lips for a good long drink, you would sputter,
							cough, and grunt "Whisky!" If good, you would finally become reconciled.</p>
						<p>An army passing through an enemy's country <hi rend="i">will</hi> have some of the
							good things, eatable or drinkable, if there are any within five miles on either side
							of the line of march. The unhappy man with a well-stocked cellar on the line of march
							will go thirsty for the balance of that year. I have seen men rush to a stagnant,
							swampy mud-hole, get down on their stomachs, and drink water that the horses would not
							touch.</p>
						<p>One day, while halting, one of the men spied a baby in a house near by. He was off
							like a shot, secured it, and brought it out, and it was passed from one to another,
								<pb id="VAB1849-295" n="269"/> was caressed and kissed as never was babe before. The
							poor mother stood trembling, in an agony of fear lest it never reach her arms again.
							On another occasion the sight of a baby raised a shout that caused its frightened
							mother to clutch it and run off and hide out of reach, and no persuasion could induce
							her to return with it.</p>
						<p>On one occasion, when away down in Mississippi, Alabama, or some other God forsaken
							place, when on half rations, fresh meat had grown to be one of the things that memory
							dwelt upon with longing. A little party found a slab-sided land shark roaming the
							woods, and soon brought it down to fresh pork. While in the very act, red-handed, the
							General pounced down upon them. In passing I was hailed by his Adjutant, and taken to
							the spot. The General stood aghast at the enormity of this breach of "orders," and
							went on lecturing the men upon the heinousness of the crime. I did not interrupt him,
							wanting time to think of some way out of the dilemma, but could find none, other than
							to charge back upon him the folly of expecting men with guns in their hands to resist
							such temptation, when living on half rations of "sow-belly and hard-tack." When
							ordered to prefer charges against the men, I bluntly refused, telling him that if he
							wanted it done he must do it himself--that I considered it an act worthy of
							commendation. Whether the boys sent him a roast, and thus mollified him, I do not
							remember. I heard no more of it, at all events.</p>
						<p>Another time, after marching all day, a detail was ordered for guard duty. Upon
							inquiry I learned that <pb id="VAB1849-296" n="270"/> it was to guard the house of a
							prominent rebel. I directed the Adjutant to pay no attention to it. Some hours after,
							the brigade Adjutant rode over to learn why it was not furnished. I told him we came
							out to fight rebels, not to guard their property. Of course the 44th stood badly at
							court. Its Colonel was looked upon as most insubordinate, and a good opportunity
							awaited for his overthrow. I attended this same "court " on occasion, and saw
							richly-appareled secesh ladies drive up in grand style--their coachman and courier in
							livery--alight, present themselves to the commander of a Union army, who bowed himself
							to the very ground--the slightest intimation of their wishes a command to be
							obeyed.</p>
						<p>We remained for some weeks in camp at Battle Creek, guarding the river--the rebel
							pickets on the opposite shore.</p>
						<p>Many incidents of interest, happening here, time and space will not permit my
							dwelling upon; but one incident I will give. General Buell was by instinct, if not by
							birth, possessed of all the <hi rend="i">chivalry</hi> of the true Southerner. Within
							our camp was the residence of an an officer in the rebel army. His family, living in
							our very midst, were on intimate terms with the officers and men of our army, and were
							fully informed of all going on about them. Their slaves, cattle, horses, sheep and all
							other property were guarded with scrupulous care. The wife of this rebel officer,
							desiring to visit her husband, was, after some weeks, passed over the river within the
							enemy's lines, by order of General Buell. This lady was escorted by myself and others
							to the <pb id="VAB1849-297" n="271"/> river. She was undoubtedly expected by her
							friends on the other side. This took place while General Bragg was getting ready for
							his invasion of Kentucky; and when fully prepared he marched his army north, leaving
							Buell to follow at his leisure--which he did, abandoning all of his immense line of
							fortifications and railroad bridges, for the benefit of our Southern brethren. Then
							commenced the great foot race for Louisville, which was won by Buell, while Bragg was
							bagging the game on the way and capturing many thousands of federal troops.</p>
						<p>After waiting at Louisville to reorganize, and for the large reinforcements the loyal
							North hurried to his aid--while Bragg and his army overran Kentucky--at length Buell
							leisurely moved his army into the neighborhood of the enemy, but carefully avoided
							giving battle.</p>
						<p>When we reached Perryville, Bragg forced a fight with a portion of our army, and a
							whole hecatomb of lives of brave men was sacrificed--for what? Let Don Carlos Buell
							answer. He was not even aware, for some hours, that there was a battle in progress;
							which might possibly indicate that Bragg ungenerously failed to give due notice of his
							intentions. Our division was within easy reach, and for hours in line of battle,
							awaiting orders to move forward into the fight. At last they came.</p>
						<p>Away down in memory's depths I can see that chivalric Kentuckian, Colonel H---, move
							to the front of his brigade,--his face newly shaven, his long hair smoothly combed
							back from his martial brow, mustachios freshly waxed, and twisted into rat-tails on
							each <pb id="VAB1849-298" n="272"/> side his face; his chapeau-bras in hand, and with
							it gently beckoning forward his brave knights to the charge as he backed his
							caracoling steed with the skill and grace of a knight of old in list of
							tournament,--when lo! the enemy were on their winding way in full retreat --the
							cravens.</p>
						<p>We arrived only to find the battle-field strewn with the slain. Never was such a
							ghastly sight as was here presented--in cold blood to be called to look upon the
							slaughtered thousands--the enemy gone.</p>
						<p>This was Buell's first and only battle. To him alone belongs the credit of this
							massacre. He was displaced from command, and compelled to render an account before a
							tribunal presided over by--<hi rend="i">General Lew. Wallace</hi>.</p>
						<p>After some days wasted, we were ordered in pursuit of Bragg's retreating army, which
							was loaded down with the rich spoils gathered in his Kentucky raid. When we had
							overtaken him we could only skirmish with his rear guard as he was driven out of the
							State.</p>

						<p>HereI must bid a final adieu to the 44th Indiana. My recollections have carried me
							far beyond what I intended or was expected, and I owe an apology for the delay caused
							thereby. I will close with a sentiment.</p>
						<p>Here's to the men of the glorious old 44th Indiana. May their memory be ever green in
							the hearts of their countrymen--" May they live a thousand years, and their shadow
							never be less."</p>

										<salute rend="left i">Hon. F. P. Randall, Mayor, Fort Wayne, Ind.:</salute>
										<p>M<hi rend="sc">Y</hi> D<hi rend="sc">EAR</hi> S<hi rend="sc">IR</hi>,--Your
											very kind and welcome letter of the 20th inst. was handed me yesterday. Your
											commendations and congratulations, if applied to the regiment, are merited. It
											is certainly very gratifying to me to know that our efforts are appreciated by
											our friends at home.</p>
										<p>We have not had full justice from the press--nor yet in official reports of
											commanding officers; neither does my own official report, gotten up under a
											constant demand for it every half hour, give a fair understanding of what we
											accomplished in this our first battle. I do not know how it was done, but
											another regiment is given the position the 44th Indiana occupied in the battle
											of the afternoon. We were in advance of the 11th Indiana when the 44th made
											its brilliant charge up the hill. As to the "supporting part," I never heard
											of it until I saw it in the published reports. The 8th Missouri being in
											advance of us, engaged the enemy first. We were exposed to the same bullets,
											however, and to get at the enemy I was compelled to change our position to the
											left of that regiment--one of the things, I can assure you, both difficult and
											dangerous to do in the face of a perfect hailstorm of bullets. It was
											successfully accomplished, however, and we charged up the hill in gallant
											style, cheering lustily.</p>
										<p><hi rend="i">Our charge</hi> was what started the rebels back to their
											entrenchments. At this time the 11th Indiana was yet in our rear and passing
											to our left. I do not mean by what I say to detract from other regiments, but
											to make plain our part and to claim what is justly our due. I very freely
											acknowledge that Morgan L. Smith <pb id="VAB1849-300" n="274"/> and the 8th
											Missouri deserve greater credit than any, as they had the advance, engaged the
											enemy first, and fought gloriously. To him and his regiment I give the full
											meed of praise. The 44th fought its own battles of the morning and afternoon,
											neither seeing nor receiving an order from any other than its own Colonel. Had
											either division or brigade commander been with us during the battle, we might
											not have been denied the justice we failed to get in their official
											reports.</p>
										<p>It would afford me great pleasure to be able to comply with your suggestion
											to send you a fine secesh flag. I would most gladly do this, as a very slight
											return for the "old glory" you and the ladies presented us. I will bear it in
											mind, and make a dash for the finest looking one when opportunity offers. Had
											we not been hurried off with such cruel haste from Donelson, after the
											surrender--scarcely given time to bury our dead or care properly for our
											wounded--I might have sent you the mementoes of interest you request; others
											carried them off. You will ask why we were thus hurried away. Well, perhaps
											because our brigade was first to march in and take possession of the Fort. The
											44th, at the head of the column, marched through the ranks of the enemy to the
											river, and took possession of the immense stores of property captured. Whether
											we were too fast in doing this or not, I won't say. We had been ordered to
											make an attack that morning on the rebel works, and were all ready to march
											forward for this purpose, when news reached us of the surrender,--it was not
											official, and we marched on and took possession.</p>
										<p>It looked very much for a time as if we would have to fight our way in. The
											enemy were drawn up in line of battle on each side of the road, with their
											guns ready to bring to their shoulders. Had any officer given the command,
											"Ready-fire," we should not have gone in without a fight. While we were
											marching over the battle-field of the preceding day, and over the rebel
											entrenchments, I for the first time fully realized all the horrors of war. The
											ground was in many places strewn with the dead, many of them horribly mangled
											by cannonballs. But this is the dark side of the picture; it had best be left
											covered.</p>
										<p>I have already written a long letter, but have not yet done what I started
											out to do. I wish to give some account of the battle of the morning, this
											being the first time we were under fire--especially the part performed by
											company officers and men--so that should I not return to tell, they may have
											some little <pb id="VAB1849-301" n="275"/> portion of the credit due them. I
											wish this, because of not having given it in my official report, for reasons
											already stated.</p>
										<p>Captain Murray, Co. B, of Pierceton, left wing, fought gallantly. His fire
											was well directed, and did much execution when repulsing cavalry and infantry
											attacks. Co. B deserves high praise. Captain Murray is an old soldier--was in
											the Mexican War and in the regular army. He says he has been in a number of
											battles, and never saw a better fought one. This company was much exposed, and
											lost heavily.</p>
										<p>Captain Cuppy, Co. E, of Whitley County, was very dangerously wounded in the
											early part of the action, while in advance of his company. He is as dauntless
											as a lion. Nothing but a bullet could put him <hi rend="i">hors de
												combat.</hi> He is yet unable to return to his regiment. His 2d Lieutenant,
											McDonald, was in command of his company the balance of the day, and did well.
											Co. E lost a number of brave men in killed and wounded.</p>
										<p>Captain Bingham, Co. H, Lagrange County, was cool and intrepid. While we were
											waiting our chance at the enemy, and yet uncertain whether Colonel Logan's
											31st Illinois regiment was out of range of our guns, he took our flag from
											where it had been placed in front of our centre, and carried it forward ten or
											twelve paces, to a prominent position, and waved it in the air. He was saluted
											with a volley. I expected each moment to see him fall, but he walked back
											unharmed. Both his Lieutenants were absent, sick. Co. H fought bravely and
											well.</p>
										<p>Captain Tannehill, Co. C, of Fort Wayne, did his duty fearlessly. Prompt and
											decided, always kind and considerate, he looks to the welfare of his men
											first, his own last. This, our color company, occupied an exposed position and
											fought bravely. 1st Lieutenant Wm. Story was the first to place our colors ten
											paces in front of our line, that the enemy might know we were ready and our
											friends that we were there. 2d Lieutenant Philip Grund is as valiant as
											Hercules. He was detailed on other duty, but was not to be cheated out of the
											fight. He performed his part manfully, as did Sergeants Carman and Livingston.
											You will probably remember a freckled-faced boy of 16--Sam. Sweet, Co. C, son
											of Francis Sweet, and Tom Stanley, Co. D, son of Chauncey Stanley, who I
											thought, when they came into camp, had far better be at school; both of them
											stood their ground and fought like heroes-- blazed away at the rebels as
											coolly as the bravest. They won their spurs, and are fairly entitled to a
											"well done, good and faithful soldiers," for present reward. A. P. Waterhouse,
											John Strong, Michael Harrison, William Woodford, Owen Shaw, John Keefer, <pb
												id="VAB1849-302" n="276"/> Fred. Stine, Wm. Hedges, Wm. Nodding, John Elzie,
											James M. Flutter, Wm. Henderson, Peter Stahl, Robert Stewart, Jos. Nicodemus,
											Frank Baldwin, Milton Sites, Marion McGinnis, Jacob Kress, Aug. Travener, Jos.
											Harsh--a little dumpling of a boy of 18, with a fresh, chubby face, (called
											"Chub,") a general favorite. John C. Dee was the very first to fall, while
											fighting like a hero, giving up his young life in defense of his country. All
											deserve honorable mention, as do many others, if time and space permitted.</p>
										<p>Company I, of Elkhart County: Captain Heath is a Trojan, brave as a lion,
											prompt and wary, ever ready for an emergency, active and decided in fight or
											counsel. There is no better soldier than Captain Albert Heath. The more you
											know him, the better you like him; and his company partake of his qualities.
											1st Lieutenant Hodges, though sick, was at his post, and did his whole duty
											nobly. 2d Lieutenant Curtiss is as steady and brave as one of the Old Guard;
											and Sergeant Mansfield, D. Belknap, B. F. Layton, and very many others, are of
											the same sort.</p>
										<p>Captain Cosgrove, Co. D, of Allen County, is an intrepid soldier, cool and
											prudent, of much experience, having served in the Mexican War. In strategy he
											is an adept, and fought with valor and judgment. "You can tie to him." His 1st
											Lieutenant Wayne is as spirited and brave as his namesake, Mad Anthony. He
											will quibble over the ninth part of a hair in a bargain, and will give his
											last dollar to a friend in need. He is a good officer and a brave man. 2d
											Lieutenant, the lamented J. Delta Kerr, who died at Evansville, of typhoid
											fever contracted at Donelson--the bravest of the brave. Ever foremost in all
											that was valiant, his chivalric bearing won the hearts of all. Alas, no more
											shall he be with us on the march, or his kindly beaming face cheer our
											bivouac.</p>
										<q rend="blockquote">
											<lg>
												<l>"He sleeps his last sleep, he has fought his last battle,</l>
												<l>No more shall he waken to glory again."</l>
											</lg>
										</q>
										<p>Sergeant Geo. W. Schell, James Reed, Platt Squires, William Underwood,
											William Casebeer, D. McCord, J. McClellan, John Poppy, and John Trauger,
											deserve honorable mention, as do many others.</p>
										<p>Captain Merrill, Co. F, of DeKalb County, was sick and unable to take much
											part. 2d Lieutenant Kinmont had command. He is a brave, determined soldier,
											did his whole duty, and is deserving of high praise. Sergeant Sol. DeLong is
											entitled to especial commendation for his coolness and intrepidity. He
											preferred to pick his man as a sharpshooter, and did execution. Alexander
											Kinmont, Sol. Kinsley, Thos. Sloan, Samuel Jacques, and others, <pb
												id="VAB1849-303" n="277"/> did well. Adjutant Colgrove, first lieutenant of
											this company, performed his duty bravely during the entire day.</p>
										<p>Acting Captain Sowers, Co. A, of Steuben County, is a good officer, cautious
											and "full of cunning fence," a dangerous foe, a great tactician. He has won
											his spurs,--may he wear them to the end. 2d Lieutenant Smith is a brave man
											and a good soldier. He fought valiantly, as did also Lewis Griffith, Samuel
											Tinsley, John Gilbert, Oliver Throop, John Ryan, and many others. Captain
											Kinney and 1st Lieutenant Rose, of this company, were both absent, sick.</p>
										<p>Co. G, Captain Williams, and Co. K, Captain Aldrich, were unfortunately
											separated from the regiment, having been left at Henderson, Ky., to guard that
											post. They were highly indignant at being left behind, when the 44th stopped
											on its way down the Ohio, <hi rend="i">en route</hi> for Fort Henry.</p>
										<p>Our Surgeon, Dr. Martin, deserves much praise. No man ever devoted himself
											more faithfully to his duties. His whole time was given, day and night, to the
											care of the wounded and sick.</p>
										<p>Surgeon Rerick was in charge of the sick at Henderson and in hospital at
											Calhoun. The important duties of his position were never more faithfully and
											conscientiously performed. His whole soul is in his work.</p>
										<p>Our Chaplain, Dr. Beeks, was detailed to take charge of the wounded and sick
											on board of the steamer to Paducah. He now suffers from the effects of his
											arduous labors in their behalf. He was taken sick upon his return to the
											regiment at Fort Henry, and refusing to go where he could have proper care, he
											came with us to Pittsburg Landing, but was unable to leave the boat. He
											returned to Evansville, and from thence was sent to his home at Fort
											Wayne.</p>
										<p>If I could but give to each man of the regiment his due! This thing of being
											drawn up in line to be shot at--fizz--fizz--about your ears,--to look at the
											men while they stand waiting, waiting for the word <hi rend="i"
											>Fire!</hi>--bowing with a most subdued air to the enemy's salutations--well,
											it was not comfortable. The Illinois regiment did get away (if they ever were
											in our front), and we did blaze away, and soon became so intent upon doing it
											that we were not aware that we had been left entirely alone, and the enemy
											attempting to surround us. We gave them a very warm reception, repulsed their
											cavalry and infantry attack, and withdrew slowly and in good order to where
											our other forces had taken up their position. The 44th was the last regiment
											engaged during the <pb id="VAB1849-304" n="278"/> morning, and the very last
											to leave the field. I have already said we engaged the enemy in the afternoon,
											and drove him inside his entrenchments.</p>
										<p>Now all this may not seem of sufficient importance to you, at this late day
											after the battle, to justify my leaving many matters you refer to unanswered.
											Nevertheless, I shall have to defer them for another occasion.</p>
										<p>We are, as you say, pretty well down into Dixie, and I suppose we shall have
											a fight before going much further. But I will spare you. With kindest regards
											to Mrs. Randall and all the other ladies who helped with our flag,</p>

						<hi rend="sc">AT KENDALLVILLE, IND.,</hi><lb/> TUESDAY, APRIL 6, A. D. 1880.</head>

					<milestone unit="typography" n="___...___" rend="center"/>

					<p>O<hi rend="sc">N</hi> the 19th day of September, 1879, at a soldiers' reunion at
						Auburn, Indiana, the members of the 44th Indiana Volunteer Infantry, then present, met
						and formed a temporary organization, with Major W. B. Bingham as President, S. B. Sweet
						as Secretary, and Major J. H. Rerick as Biographer; and set April 6th, 1880, the
						eighteenth anniversary of the battle of Shiloh, and Kendallville the place, to hold the
						first reunion and perfect a permanent organization of the regiment.</p>
					<p>On the early trains on that day members of the regiment began to arrive, and by mid-day
						upwards of one hundred had congregated. Now was witnessed a scene never to be forgotten
						by the participants. Comrades true, and brave men, long since parted, once more clasped
						each other by the hand with a spirit that betokened a friendship as lasting as life,
						heartfelt greetings were heard on every side, familiar faces brought to memory scenes
						and incidents long since forgotten, battle scenes were re-enacted, incidents on the
						march and in the camp were rehearsed. The enjoyment was at its height when the long roll
						was beat and the regiment fell in line under the old regimental flag they had so often
						followed to victory.</p>



					<pb id="VAB1849-308" n="280"/>


					<p>Under command of Major Bingham, the regiment, headed by martial music, marched to the
						depot to meet expected comrades on the east and west trains. On the arrival of the
						trains, the regiment, with augmented ranks, took up the line of march for the city.
						Arriving in front of the Hall, a halt was made, when Captain Cosgrove advanced to the
						front and center of the line with the old 44th flag, and proposed for it three cheers,
						which were given with a will that only old soldiers can appreciate.</p>
					<p>Once more in the Hall, the meeting was called to order by Major Bingham, President of
						the temporary organization, after which S. H. Pierce delivered an address of welcome in
						behalf of the citizens of Kendallville.</p>
					<p>The President then announced that Colonel H. B. Reed would not be present, being
						detained at his home in New Jersey on account of sickness.</p>
					<p>The Secretary, S. B. Sweet, then stepped on the stage and read the address the Colonel
						had prepared to deliver in person. The address was listened to with marked attention,
						and at its conclusion the boys arose to their feet and gave three rousing cheers for
						Colonel Reed.</p>
					<p>Colonel W. C. Williams offered the following resolution, which was adopted
						unanimously:</p>
					<p>"That the Secretary, in behalf of the society, prepare and send to Colonel Reed a
						letter appreciative of their deep feeling of regard for him, his gallantry and devotion
						to the interest of the regiment while connected with it. Also their sympathy for him in
						his illness, which had prevented him meeting with them this day."</p>
					<p>Several letters were read from absent members of the regiment, including a telegram
						from Colonel Philip Grund, all regretting their absence, and expressing a wish to be
						remembered by their comrades; each of which was applauded by the boys.</p>
					<p>Captain S. P. Bradford moved that the regiment at once proceed to effect a permanent
						organization, which motion was adopted with cheers.</p>
					<p>Major Rerick then presented a constitution for the consideration of the society.
						Several amendments were <pb id="VAB1849-309" n="281"/> offered and added. After remarks
						on the merits of the constitution and for the best interest of the society, by Captain
						S. P. Bradford, E. O. Rose, Captain Newman, F. W. Willis, Nick Ensley, R. Lockwood, and
						others, the constitution was adopted as a whole, and reads as follows:</p>

						<p>We the undersigned ex-members of the 44th Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, hereby

									<salute rend="left">T<hi rend="sc">O THE</hi> G<hi rend="sc">ENERAL</hi> A<hi
											rend="sc">SSEMBLY OF THE</hi> S<hi rend="sc">TATE OF</hi> I<hi rend="sc"
											>NDIANA</hi>:</salute>
									<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> undersigned, officers and soldiers of the Indiana
										Volunteer Regiments, submitting with patriotic self-denial to the policy which
										denied us a voice in the late elections, and approving the wisdom of that
										feature of our government which secures the civil from the influence of the
										military power, nevertheless desire to participate in the preliminary councils
										which are to shape the popular ideas of the State, and consequently to control
										the action of its representatives in the General Assembly.</p>
									<p>We speak as soldiers, because our lives are staked upon the issues of the
										present struggle as citizens, because at no distant day those of us who survive
										are to share with you the responsibilities of citizenship, and to experience in
										common with the people at home the results of your present deliberations.
										Whatever prejudices may exist against any interference of the military in the
										affairs of State, certainly even the most vigilant guardians of the public
										interest could not expect the army to await with indifference the result of
										deliberations which involve not only the common interests of the people, but
										also the lives and fortunes of those who have taken up arms to defend the
										integrity of the Union in a contest with our common foe in the field.</p>



									<pb id="VAB1849-314" n="286"/>



									<p>Defeat strips the citizen of his fortune and his political enjoyment, the
										soldier of both these and his honor, and, it may be, his life. It requires no
										argument to convince an intelligent mind that a war sustained by a united
										people, and urged with that energy and determination which proceed only from
										undivided councils, presents a less fearful array of casualties, with a better
										hope of success, than a sluggish contest waged by a party and merely sustained
										by a wrangling of factions at home. In other words, it requires more lives to
										sustain a government hampered and restricted by the jealousy of a political
										party, than to sustain one supported by the voice of a united people. As well
										might you expect a fettered victim to struggle successfully with his untrammeled
										oppressor, as to hope for a nation to subdue its enemies when its energies are
										cramped by the unwise restrictions of a doubting majority. To live in spite of
										disease, every function must be characterized by the utmost vigor, and all unite
										against the common enemy, who seeks in the destruction of one the certain ruin
										of all. Believing, then, that as soldiers we have a deeper interest in the great
										struggle than you can possibly have as citizens, and, further, that the
										influences of military life have not unfitted us for the high duties of
										citizenship, we present ourselves before your honorable body as petitioners
										without apology.</p>
									<p>We come boldly, asking only what we have a right to expect, either as citizens
										or soldiers, battling for the integrity of the Union.</p>
									<p>We ask simply that you will give this war a cheerful and hearty support; that
										you will strengthen and energize every department of government; that this
										unhappy struggle may be pressed to a successful termination; that you will pour
										out the treasure of the State as your soldiers have poured out their blood on
										the field of battle, to aid in the holy cause of restoring the Union of our
										fathers; that you will abstain from heated political discussions and violent
										party wranglings, until the <pb id="VAB1849-315" n="287"/> authoiity of our
										government is once more established; that you will resist the infernal spirit
										which would waste victory in humiliating compromise, or render temporary
										reverses a pretext for the alienating of an offending community; that you will
										sacrifice every thing except liberty and political equality, to national
										integrity; that you will sustain all the officers of the State and general
										government in their efforts to subdue this unholy rebellion; and especially that
										you will sustain our worthy Governor, whose every energy during the past two
										years has been so entirely devoted to the cause of the government and its
										supporters. We appeal to you especially to sustain him for the reason that it is
										chiefly to his unceasing care and labor, exhibited in arming and supporting the
										troops of Indiana, that we have to attribute our present proud position among
										the loyal States of the Union; and for the further reason, that he has
										demonstrated by his acts that he is an earnest and zealous patriot, devoting his
										time with untiring energy to the glorious cause for which we are battling.</p>
									<p>We appeal to you as our Representatives, to encourage him in the good work of
										ministering to the wants of our unfortunate comrades, who have been stricken
										down in the strife of the battle-field, and by the cruelty of relentless
										disease; that you will confer on him all the necessary authority and place in
										his hands the requisite means to carry on the good work which he has begun,
										remembering that one human life is worth all the treasure of the proudest
										State.</p>
									<p>In conclusion, we propose the following resolutions be adopted by the
										Legislature of Indiana, and to constitute the basis of all their acts bearing
										upon the interests involved in the foregoing address.</p>

									<list type="ordered">
										<item n="1."><hi rend="i">Resolved,</hi> That we are unconditionally and
											determinedly in favor of the preservation of the Union.</item>
										<item n="2."><hi rend="i">Resolved,</hi> That in order to the preservation of

											and influence tending to create animosities at home, or to afford consolation
											to our enemies in arms, and that we will co-operate only with those who will
											stand by the Union, and by those who are fighting the battles of the
											Union.</item>
										<item n="5."><hi rend="i">Resolved,</hi> That we tender to his Excellency, Gov.
											O. P. Morton, the thanks of his grateful friends in the army, for his
											extraordinary efforts in their behalf, and assure him that neither time nor
											the corrupting influence of party spirit shall ever estrange the soldier from
											the soldier's friend.</item>

				<head rend="center b">NOTE.</head>
				<p>As the kind assistance rendered in the preparation of the preceding pages was rendered
					mostly after the Preface was in print, it is due that I should here make expression of
					sincere gratitude to Colonel Hugh B. Reed for his very interesting contribution under the
					title of "Personal Recollections," for the Shiloh battle scene, and much other valuable
					assistance; to all who contributed plates for the personal illustrations; to Sergeant
					George W. Gordon for the use of his published letters, "Life in the Ranks of the
					Forty-fourth Indiana"; to Samuel B. Sweet, and others, for aid on the Company records; and
					to R. H. Rerick for the map. Thanks to all.</p>
				<p>I could find no record of the names of the killed and wounded at Chickamauga, which
					accounts for this omission.</p>
				<p>The following errata are noticed: On page 193, in the record of Captain Danseur, for
					"Shiloh" read <hi rend="i">Stone River</hi>; on page 138, in the record of Surgeon Martin,
					for "Indiana" read <hi rend="i">Maryland</hi>; on page 137, for "Rev. George W. Beeks"
					read <hi rend="i">Rev. Green C. Beeks</hi>; on page 48, for "4th brigade" read <hi
						rend="i">3d brigade</hi>.</p>
				<p>Two typographical errors are noticed on page 43, where <hi rend="i">preceded</hi> is made
					to read "proceeded," and <hi rend="i">probably</hi> to read "probable." There may be other
					like errors, but these and all other imperfections I must now submit to, and trust to the
					charitable consideration of my old comrades.</p>
