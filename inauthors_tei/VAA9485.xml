          <lg>
            <l>Ho, children sing as bees or birds,</l>
            <l>With little heed for time or words,</l>
            <l>Yet mystically they impart</l>
            <l>The gladness that is in the heart-- </l>
            <l>They have no sense of rule or rhyme</l>
            <l>Nor care for measure--beat of time;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">They only sing</l>
            <l>From their sheer joy in everything.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Some senseless sentence they have made</l>
            <l>While carelessly they dreamed or played</l>
            <l>They weave into a chanted glee</l>
            <l>Wherein is all of melody,</l>
            <l>And rapt of eyes and sweet of face</l>
            <l>They make each spot a happy place.</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">We older ones</l>
            <l>Would catch the childsong as it runs.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>The child knows all the songs of earth--</l>
            <l>And each song has its tone of mirth--</l>
            <l>The child hears all the harmonies</l>
            <l>Of rustling grass and windswept trees;</l>
            <l>The chanting, humming girl or boy</l>



            <pb id="VAA9485-010" n="12"/>


            <l>Knows all the world's dim strain of joy</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And bit by bit</l>
            <l>The childsong holds and echoes it.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>If you or I might tune our souls</l>
            <l>To the true harmony that rolls</l>
            <l>Above, below, and all around,</l>
            <l>Our songs would lose their harsher sound;</l>
            <l>We might, as little girls and boys,</l>
            <l>Unconsciously sing to our toys--</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Then I and you</l>
            <l> Might strike one note that would ring true.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Perhaps the great triumphal chord</l>
            <l>The angels sing before the Lord,</l>
            <l>The dawnsong of the stars and suns</l>
            <l>Is like the song of little ones--</l>
            <l>Pure, sweet, untouched of skill or art,</l>
            <l>But welling from the inmost heart</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">A perfect thing--</l>
            <l>Such songs the little children sing.</l>

            <l>Sometimes my papa, when it's night an' time to go to bed,</l>

            <l>My papa, when he says 'at he will sing me off to sleep,</l>
            <l>He holds my head against him--an' there's something awful deep</l>
            <l>An' buzzin' like inside o' him, like our cat when it purrs.</l>
            <l>An' he 'ist laugh--an' mama, too-when I ast where is her's,</l>
            <l>'Cause she don't purr at all. But most 'at puzzles me is why</l>

            <l>Whoever takes me up th' stairs an' turns th' covers down.</l>
            <l>An' by an' by, somehow, when he is singing "Sleepy Town,"</l>
            <l>Why, I forget 'ist when he stops, an' I wake up again</l>

            <l>My sawdust heart is broken, and my china eyes are sad--</l>
            <l>This night has been the darkest that I ever, ever had;</l>
            <l>The little girl who owns me used to tuck me in my bed</l>
            <l>And whisper that she loved me, while she covered up my head</l>
            <l>And told me to be careful not to kick the covers off,</l>
            <l>For fear I might be croupy, or should catch the whooping cough.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>But yesterday a stranger came and took my cherished place--</l>
            <l>A waxen, flax haired stranger with a bright, unbattered face.</l>
            <l>The little girl who owns me let me drop upon the floor</l>
            <l>And hugged the stylish stranger, and has thought of me no more;</l>
            <l>And all last night, neglected, I have slept beside the wall,</l>
            <l>Unhappy and untidy, poor Samantha Ann--a doll.</l>

            <l>One year ago my fortune seemed to be serenely bright--</l>
            <l>The little girl would hold me in her arms from morn till night;</l>
            <l>She made me share her play with her, she tried to make me eat,</l>
            <l>She showed me to all callers--and they vowed that I was sweet;</l>
            <l>I had four sets of dresses, and a parasol, and fan,</l>
            <l>And she would say that I was her beloved Samantha Ann.</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Alas! My dress is tattered-I've no other to put on;</l>
            <l>Half of my hair is missing, and my poor left arm is gone;</l>
            <l>And now the silk clad beauty that was smiling from the tree</l>
            <l>Has claimed all the attention which was once bestowed on me.</l>
            <l>My sawdust heart is broken--I have slept against the wall</l>
            <l>Where she, with shouts of welcome for the other, let me fall!</l>

            <l>Paw gets the funny papers, an' he reads 'em every week,</l>

            <l>But I don't see just why it is it gets me punishings,</l>
            <l>Whenever I see any chance to do some funny things.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>One time paw saw a picture of a funny little boy</l>
            <l>What put a tack upon a chair--an' that filled paw with joy.</l>
            <l>An' so, I took a notion to do like that funny kid--</l>
            <l>I put a tack upon a chair, an' paw sat down--he did!</l>
            <l>Then for a day or two we had to eat things from a shelf.</l>
            <l>Why can't my paw see any joke in what I do, myself?</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Another time there was a boy--a picture boy, I mean--</l>
            <l>What painted cats an' monkeys on the tablecloth so clean.</l>


            <pb id="VAA9485-031" n="33"/>

            <l>Well, paw, he laughed all day at that, an' so I went an' got</l>
            <l>Some paint an' fixed our table. Now I wish that I had not!</l>
            <l>Why is it, when I'm funny, paw he never laughs, but spanks?</l>
            <l>I try to entertain him but I don't get any thanks.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>An' once there was a picture of a boy what fixed a pail</l>
            <l>Of water where his paw would step into it without fail</l>
            <l>An' then go slidin' down the stairs with water in his ears,</l>
            <l>An' paw he laughed at that until he wiped away his tears.</l>
            <l>But when I fixed the bucket-- Well, I'd ruther skip the rest.</l>
            <l>Why should such funny antics make my paw call me a pest?</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>One picture paw just howled at showed a boy what had a gun</l>
            <l>An' shot his father's legs all full of "buckshot number one."</l>
            <l>I tried to show my parents that I was a humorist.</l>
            <l>The doctor says paw will get well; an' paw he shakes his fist.</l>
            <l>I wish I could do something that would cause a lot of joy.</l>

          <head rend="center">THREE IN THE AFTERNOON</head>


          <lg>
            <l>Just about three in the afternoon,</l>
            <l>One of these early days in June,</l>
            <l>A fellow will fall in a soft daydream</l>
            <l>And look at the white, white clouds that gleam</l>
            <l>Like sails that are drifting across the sky,</l>
            <l>And, deaf to the city's toil-wearied cry,</l>
            <l>Will dream till again as of old he sees</l>
            <l>The wavering boughs of the drowsing trees.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Just about three--then the air grew still</l>
            <l>And the brook breathed "Hush," as it passed the mill,</l>
            <l>And the bees loafed by through the mottled shade</l>
            <l>Where the beams of the sun through the branches played,</l>
            <l>And the wild rose glowed with the blush of June--</l>
            <l>Just about three in the afternoon.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>And somebody, somewhere far away,</l>
            <l>Was singing a song that was like the day--</l>
            <l>A lullaby-song, and the tones were dim,</l>
            <l>And they floated by like an echoed hymn;</l>
            <l>And you lay still, and you understood</l>
            <l>That the world was glad and the world was good.</l>
          </lg>


          <pb id="VAA9485-037" n="37"/>

          <lg>
            <l>And high in the sky like a pirate boat</l>
            <l>Was a circling hawk, on its wings afloat;</l>
            <l>And you would look up through the broken weaves</l>
            <l>Of the green-blue fabric of sky and leaves--</l>
            <l>And, sleepily musing, your soul would reach</l>
            <l>The heights of a song all too sweet for speech--</l>
            <l>Just about three in the afternoon</l>
            <l>One of those early days in June.</l>

            <l>In each high white cloud that dreams</l>
            <l>As it drifts across the breast</l>
            <l>Of the sky, in lazy quest</l>
            <l>Of some haven far and fair--</l>
            <l>Weave me sun and sky and air</l>
            <l>In your song that has no word,</l>

          </lg>

            <l>Catch, ballade and roundelay</l>
            <l>That go pulsing through the day;</l>
            <l>Fling your arms and blithely troll</l>
            <l>Swinging strains that stir the soul,</l>
            <l>Roaring chants that rise sublime--</l>
            <l>Diapason bursts of rhyme,</l>
            <l>Rhyme of air and cloud and sky</l>
            <l>Born from your wild minstrelsy.</l>

            <l>Sing, then, sing; and let me see</l>
            <l>The song billows shake the tree;</l>
            <l>Shout and laugh, and shout again</l>
            <l>Till the boughs are bent--and then</l>
            <l>Melt into the minor bars</l>
            <l>That you sing beneath the stars</l>
            <l>When the fingertip of night</l>
            <l>Quiets all the crimson light</l>
            <l>That has swept in from the west,</l>
            <l>Soothing the worn world to rest;</l>
            <l>Whisper wistfully, and sigh</l>
            <l>Your low, loving lullaby.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Sing, O wind among the trees;</l>
            <l>Weave your endless rhapsodies.</l>
            <l>Choral chants that leap and surge,</l>
            <l>Mellow murmurs of a dirge.</l>
            <l>Song and sob and laughter blent</l>
            <l>When your fancy is unpent,</l>
            <l>Let me marvel at it all--</l>
            <l>Organ tone and trumpet call,</l>

            <l>One woman went out on the way of shame</l>
            <l>And the wide world marveled, and read her name.</l>
            <l>And praised her beauty, and gaped and cheered</l>
            <l>When, light and fluttering, she appeared.</l>
            <l>But one little woman in hodden gray</l>
            <l>Went out to the suffering, night and day--</l>
            <l>And never for her was the trump of fame</l>
            <l>And never a cheer as she went or came.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>One woman went out on the path of lies--</l>
            <l>And the whole wide world praised her lustrous eyes,</l>
            <l>And paused and listened when she would speak,</l>
            <l>And marked the roses that graced her cheek.</l>
            <l>But one little woman in dingy black</l>
            <l>Went down where the weary were on the rack</l>
            <l>And carried the woes of the sad and lone,</l>
            <l>And comforted many--and was unknown.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>One woman set foot on the road of wrong--</l>
            <l>They blazoned her deeds in a joyous song</l>
            <l>That told of her daring, her charm, and wit,</l>
            <l>And the world went humming and singing it.</l>
            <l>But one little woman in homely gown</l>
            <l>Went seeking for sorrow about the town,</l>


            <pb id="VAA9485-043" n="43"/>


            <l>And smiles came to gladden where she found tears--</l>

          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>But somewhere the record is fairly kept--</l>
            <l>Unless at his task has the angel slept--</l>

            <l>Ho, the wonder of it! Is the winter swept away?</l>
            <l>Blown before the balsam breath from out the south today?</l>
            <l>Jewel-like, a blue bird gleams in circles far and high</l>
            <l>Under all the wonder of the sapphire shining sky;</l>
            <l>Down and down and down to us the lilting bird notes fall--</l>

            <l>That has loosed its hold upon the boughs it used to twine;</l>
            <l>Hurries on and flurries on, and echoes all along</l>

            <l>Earth and sky have heard it; it has swept across the night,</l>
            <l>Touching all the little stars with new and gladder light,</l>
            <l>Softening the depths of space until in them appear</l>

            <l>Now the sunshine shimmers in the distance of the day</l>

          <lg>
            <l>White and smooth, serene and still,</l>
            <l>All unbroken by a hill,</l>
            <l>Down and down with gentle sweep,</l>
            <l>To the quiet House of Sleep;</l>
            <l>Skirted by the drowsy streams,</l>
            <l>Whispering the song of dreams,</l>
            <l>Past the fields with poppies sowed,</l>
            <l>Goes the Sundown Road.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Leading down into the west,</l>
            <l>Where the breezes sing of rest,</l>
            <l>Where the kindly trees have made</l>
            <l>Gray retreats of peace and shade;</l>
            <l>Where the sounds of afternoon</l>

            <l>Man and maid, and children--all</l>
            <l>Lured along the drowsy way,</l>
            <l>Outward from the world of day,</l>
            <l>Soothed by low-toned lullabies</l>
            <l>In the sweetest of all keys,</l>

            <pb id="VAA9485-051" n="51"/>

            <l>Where no haunting fears forebode--</l>

          <lg>
            <l>From the countryside and town,</l>
            <l>One and all they journey down,</l>

            <l>Ho, the rosy road of rest</l>
            <l>Is of all the roads the best,</l>
            <l>Where the shadows bend and bless</l>
            <l>Us with all their gentleness!</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Against the sunset's purple glow he stands</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">As though a statue formed of ruddy bronze,</l>
            <l>A warder of the golden harvest lands</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">That show the silent labor of the dawns</l>
            <l>And noons and nights, and magic of the sun,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And alchemy of wind and cloud and rain--</l>
            <l>And through the sea of wheat the billows run</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Like endless waves that sweep across the main.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>The harvester with bared head stands and sees</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">The nodding grain that waits the morrow's toil,</l>
            <l>The waving wheat that lifts above his knees,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">The heavy grain his labor has for spoil;</l>
            <l>And from the haze that hangs above the height</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Come subtle whispers from the far off lands,</l>
            <l>That bring a murmured message, low and light,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Which tells they wait the labor of his hands.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>His is a greatness wrested not in war,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">A dignity but yet half understood--</l>
            <l>Not serf, but all the nations' servitor,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">He looks upon his work, and it is good.</l>
            <l>Out on the wheat his lengthened shadow slants,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1"> A simile of labor's shielding worth,</l>


            <pb id="VAA9485-053" n="53"/>

            <l>And to his ears there come the crooning chants</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">That with the coming night are given birth.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>The sunset flings its last red banners high</l>
            <l rend="ti-1"> And still he stands, as statues stand and brood,</l>
            <l>A silhouette against the blazing skky--</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">A man in well done toil's uplifting mood..</l>
            <l>And then the night lets fall its dusky shroud</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">With wondrous jewelings of star on star--</l>
            <l>A royal robe for him, the swarthy browed,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Who spends his strength for peoples near and far.</l>

            <l>And the lark trills a song</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And the thrush makes reply.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Miles away, so it seems,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Are the spires of the town--</l>
            <l>But the shade holds our dreams</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Where the light shuttles down;</l>
            <l>And there is not a sigh,</l>

            <l>As thick as Vallombrosa's leaves</l>
            <l>The snow comes swirling; and it weaves</l>
            <l>White draperies in which we trace</l>
            <l>The milky foaminess of lace,</l>
            <l>And see, alert and tremulous,</l>
            <l>The snow sprites kiss their hands to us.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>The snow sprites leap and dance and sail,</l>
            <l>And merrily they draw a veil</l>
            <l>Before the gloomy, naked trees</l>
            <l>That frown upon such revelries;</l>

            <l>They trip their silent saraband.</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Then, with a magic wondrous strange</l>
            <l>The picture has a sweeping change.</l>
            <l>Here is a plain--a wintry waste</l>
            <l>Where neither trees nor hills are traced;</l>
            <l>And rhythmically clear there come</l>
            <l>Dull beats upon a sodden drum.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>And, shuffling, shuffling, soldierwise</l>

            <l>A picture strange--a picture weird!</l>
            <l>Worn men with snow flecked hair and beard;</l>
            <l>A flag that holds a filmy wreath--</l>
            <l>A stainless, clinging, snowy sheath;</l>

            <l>And blots out flag and guns and men.</l>
            <l>Again the snow sprites pirouette</l>
            <l>Through saraband and minuette.</l>
            <l>As thick as Vallombrosa's leaves</l>

            <l>Eighty year, I am, an' past--</l>
            <l>Nothin' much that I can do</l>

            <l>Friends I've had-an' I suppose</l>

            <l>Eighty year--an' they go fast.</l>

            <l>Not the shadder that it was--</l>
            <l>Shadders change as humans does.</l>
            <l>First I mind of it at all</l>
            <l>Was one time in airly fall--</l>

            <l>But at night--One time the moon</l>
            <l>Made my shadder help me out</l>
            <l>When my mind was full o' doubt</l>
            <l>An' my heart was in a whirl</l>

          <head rend="center">THE AVERAGE MAN</head>


          <lg>
            <l>The average man is the man of the mill,</l>
            <l>The man of the valley, or man of the hill,</l>
            <l>The man at the throttle, the man at the plow--</l>
            <l>The man with the sweat of his toil on his brow,</l>
            <l>Who brings into being the dreams of the few,</l>
            <l>Who works for himself, and for me, and for you.</l>
            <l>There is not a purpose, a project, or plan</l>
            <l>But rests on the strength of the average man.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>The growth of a city, the might of a land</l>
            <l>Depend on the fruit of the toil of his hand;</l>
            <l>The road, or the wall, or the mill, or the mart,</l>
            <l>Call daily to him that he furnish his part;</l>
            <l>The pride of the great, and the hope of the low,</l>
            <l>The toll of the tide as it ebbs to and fro,</l>
            <l>The reach of the rails and the countries they span</l>
            <l>Tell what is the trust in the average man.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>The man who, perchance, thinks he labors alone--</l>
            <l>The man who stands out between hovel and throne</l>
            <l>The man who gives freely his brain and his brawn</l>
            <l>Is the man that the world has been builded upon.</l>
            <l>The clang of the hammer, the sweep of the saw,</l>



            <pb id="VAA9485-069" n="67"/>

            <l>The flash of the forge--they have strengthened the law,</l>
            <l>They have rebuilt the realms that the wars overran,</l>
            <l>They have shown us the worth of the average man.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>So here's to the average man--to the one</l>
            <l>Who has labored unknown on the tasks he has done,</l>
            <l>Who has helped us to win in the stress and the strife.</l>
            <l>He has bent to his toil, thinking neither of fame</l>
            <l>Nor of tribute, nor honor, nor prize, nor acclaim--</l>
            <l>In the forefront of progress, since progress began--</l>
            <l>Here's a health and a hail to the average man!</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Carve me an angel, sculptor, and let your stone be white,</l>
            <l>So white that it will shimmer, reflecting back the light--</l>
            <l>Give it a semblance, sculptor--a form and shape like this:</l>
            <l>A lassie wee and drowsy, who gives a good night kiss,</l>
            <l>Too weary from all her playing to open her lips to speak--</l>
            <l>And carve the chubby fingers that touch her mother's cheek;</l>
            <l>Ah, and she needs no halo--simply a wayward curl;</l>
            <l>That is an angel, sculptor--somebody's little girl</l>

            <l>What for an angel, sculptor? Get you your marble fine,</l>
            <l>Carve it with patient purpose, coax it to curve and line;</l>
            <l>Drape it with flowing garments, give it the simple charms--</l>
            <l>Carve us a mother holding her baby in her arms,</l>
            <l>Wonderful, tender, hopeful, sweet she must be and wise</l>
            <l>And with the light of heaven glimmering in her eyes.</l>



            <pb id="VAA9485-081" n="79"/>

            <l>That is an angel, sculptor--see that you carve it sure,</l>
            <l>Showing the love that surges out from a soul all pure. </l>
            <l>Carve me an angel, sculptor. Carve us a woman, old,</l>
            <l>And grave in all the wrinkles her withered cheeks must hold--</l>
            <l>Wrinkles that tell of sorrow, lines that the laughs have left;</l>
            <l>Give her the knotted fingers no longer quick and deft,</l>
            <l>Bend her with stress of toiling, bow her with weight of years,</l>
            <l>Show us the golden beauty wrought of her smiles and tears,</l>
            <l>Tell in the stone the story, how she is wan and worn</l>
            <l>Through all her self-denial for the ones that she has borne.</l>
            <l>That is an angel, sculptor. Grave it, and carve it so,</l>

            <l>It is through the week the coupons are cut;</l>
            <l>It is through the week that we grub for pelf</l>

          <lg>
            <l>The devil's tattoo is a singular air--</l>
            <l>You tap out the tune on the arm of a chair,</l>
            <l>Or beat out its bars and its measures grotesque</l>
            <l>While nervously eyeing the top of a desk;</l>
            <l>Or finger the chords of its endless refrain</l>
            <l>When glum at your window you tap on the pane--</l>
            <l>And these are the words of the devil's tattoo:</l>
            <l>"There's nothing, there's nothing whatever to do--</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">So what can I do?</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">There's nothing to do--</l>
            <l>There's nothing, there's nothing whatever to do.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Unconsciously, when you are down on your luck,</l>
            <l>The opening measures are sure to be struck--</l>
            <l>You think, when too late, if you only had known</l>
            <l>How affairs were to turn you would not have been thrown.</l>
            <l>Then light on the table you start the tattoo:</l>
            <l>"There's nothing, there's nothing whatever to do--</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">The truth isn't true;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">The world is deep blue--</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Young fellow, I want to hold speech with you--</l>
            <l>But never a word of the things you do,</l>
            <l>And never a word of the ways you walk,</l>
            <l>Nor the hours you keep, nor the way you talk,</l>
            <l>For I know that a man is called undergrown</l>
            <l>If his wild, wild oats are as yet unsown.</l>
            <l>But I wondered if somewhere, away from here,</l>
            <l>Somebody--a woman--I know it's queer;</l>
            <l>I wondered if she doesn't bend and sigh</l>
            <l>O'er a picture of you in the days gone by.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>O,certainly not. I've no mind to preach,</l>
            <l>And no creed to give, and no rules to teach.</l>
            <l>I was thinking, that's all, as I watched your face,</l>
            <l>And I thought that somehow I could faintly trace</l>
            <l>The path where the dimples played hide and seek</l>
            <l>When you were a toddler--there, in your cheek.</l>
            <l>And I wondered, that's all, as a man will do,</l>
            <l>Who cherished the picture she kept of you.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>You'll pardon me, surely? It's not for me</l>
            <l>To hinder your pleasures. A man is free</l>
            <l>To come and to go as he likes; and, yes,</l>
            <l>To act as he pleases. That's right, I guess.</l>


            <pb id="VAA9485-087" n="85"/>

            <l>It's simply a fancy, because you are</l>
            <l>A stranger to me. And I wouldn't mar</l>
            <l>A moment of yours. But, whose fingers hold</l>
            <l>The picture they took when your locks were gold?</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>When you were a toddler! Your picture, then,</l>
            <l>Before you set foot on the path of men.</l>
            <l>I simply was wondering who would-- Well,</l>
            <l>Who treasures your picture, and loves to tell</l>
            <l>The tales of your wonderful boyhood years?</l>
            <l>And maybe she kisses it, while her tears</l>
            <l>Come clouding the sunlight that's in her smiles</l>
            <l>At thinking of all of the baby whiles.</l>
            <l>And the measuring mark that she made on the wall--</l>
            <l>But then, it is not my concern, at all.</l>

            <l>I long to show the waiting world that I am rich in merit,</l>
            <l>But still I cannot quite decide what traits I must inherit;</l>
            <l>Two thrilling calls forever surge and whisper unto me,</l>
            <l>And one of them is from the land, the other from the sea.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>And so of mixed heredity I am a sad bewailer</l>
            <l>Since Adam was a farmer and old Noah was a sailor.</l>

            <l>Sometimes when Adam's influence is strong I am inclined</l>
            <l>To hold the plow and till the soil--and then I change my mind,</l>
            <l>For Noah's blood is in my veins and that gives me the notion</l>
            <l>That I should brave the biting gales that blow upon the ocean;</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>O, shall it be a sulky plow or ship that I shall ride?</l>
            <l>I've pondered it these many years and still cannot decide.</l>



            <pb id="VAA9485-091" n="89"/>

            <l>At sea I'd be a jolly tar, on land perhaps a tailor--</l>
            <l>But Adam was a farmer and old Noah was a sailor.</l>

            <l>My relatives and friends at times think they'll take me to task--</l>
            <l>"Why don't you get a move on you?" in meaning tones they ask,</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>And then I must explain to them--it causes lots of bother--</l>
            <l>That I don't know if Noah or old Ad. was my forefather,</l>
            <l>Whereat they sniff and sometimes sneer and almost make me sob</l>
            <l>By hinting that they think it's time I go and get a job!</l>

            <l>O, land or sea? What must I be? A jailor or a whaler--</l>
            <l>Since Adam was a farmer and old Noah was a sailor?</l>

          <head rend="center">HIS RAVING</head>


          <lg>
            <l>It was on a morning sunny when I thought to spend some money</l>
            <l>For some incidental matters in a big department store.</l>
            <l>So with attitude inquiring I outlined my dim desiring</l>
            <l>To a person awe inspiring who stood near the open door.</l>
            <l>"Eight aisles down, and then," he shouted, "seek the counter near the door--</l>
            <l rend="ti-1"> Near the elevator door."</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Ah, distinctly I recall it--really he'd no need to bawl it</l>
            <l>As the captain of an army bawled commands in days of yore,</l>
            <l>With his swordlike finger showing me the way I should be going,</l>
            <l>Nor to come behind, tiptoeing from his post beside the door,</l>
            <l>"Eight aisles down," the words repeating, "then the counter near the door"--</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Bowing neatly as before.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>In a moment I'd have sauced him--but that moment I had lost him</l>


            <pb id="VAA9485-093" n="91"/>

            <l>For a wave of women tossed him to his post beside the door,</l>
            <l>And I with that wave was merging, with that wave so madly surging</l>
            <l>In a current swiftly verging down the center of the store.</l>
            <l>Then I tried to count the counters as the wave of women bore</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Me, a bubble, through the store.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Presently I grew affrighted, but a friendly face I sighted;</l>
            <l>"Miss," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore,</l>
            <l>But the fact is I was looking for some things to use in cooking--</l>
            <l>If your anger I am brooking I am sorry, as before--</l>
            <l>But if you'll just give me leeway"--As the waves break on the shore</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">I was jammed across the floor.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Then they all began to trample on my toes to get a sample</l>
            <l>Of the goods that made the garments that a waxen dummy wore,</l>
            <l>And I cursed in Greek and Latin while they called for silk and satin,</l>
            <l>Women thin and women fat in one tremendous rush and roar.</l>



            <pb id="VAA9485-094" n="92"/>

            <l>"Eight or eighty aisles," I muttered, "I am getting very sore.</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Let me only find the door."</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>To the door at last they threw me--and I feared they might pursue me,</l>
            <l>But they swarmed about the counters, looking patterns o'er and o'er.</l>
            <l>Then that floorman so beguiling once more murmured to me, smiling,</l>
            <l>"Did you find"--Ah, this was riling!--"find the counter near the door?"</l>
            <l>Then I turned and shouted: "No sir!" and I hastened through the door</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">To go shopping nevermore.</l>

            <l>When Daniel Webster Franklin Green went to the legislature</l>

            <l>That down the vista of the years, far as the future reaches,</l>
            <l>Should pour the torrent of the cheers roused by his burning speeches,</l>

          <lg>
            <l>He drafted bills--to benefit us all was his intention--</l>
            <l>A bill to crush the wicked trusts is one that we may mention;</l>
            <l>Another one to regulate the railway rates he fathered;</l>
            <l>A dozen others he got up--however, he was bothered</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Of all the people that I know</l>
            <l>There are no two like Jake and Joe.</l>
            <l>Now, Joe, since he was quite a youth</l>
            <l>Has been--well, he would stretch the truth;</l>
            <l>Not lie, exactly, but when he</l>
            <l>Would see some one, say you or me,</l>
            <l>He'd stop and smile and wave his hand</l>
            <l>And cry:--" Old man, you're lookin' grand!"</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">It's just his way.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Jake is the other way about--</l>
            <l>Somehow, he always seems to doubt</l>
            <l>The realness of the things he sees;</l>
            <l>That is, he pretty near agrees</l>
            <l>With you if you say you feel well,</l>
            <l>"But then," he'll say, "a man can't tell</l>
            <l>He may think that he feels all right,</l>
            <l>But finds his deathbed ere the night!"</l>

          <lg>
            <l>But Joe, for instance, never frets;</l>
            <l>His talk is slangy with "You bets!"</l>
            <l>Why, each and everything he does</l>
            <l>Is just the best that ever was,</l>

            <pb id="VAA9485-098" n="96"/>

            <l>To hear him tell it. Man alive,</l>

            <l rend="ti-1">It's just his way.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Jake's horse might have a faster gait;</l>
            <l>Joe's horse can win with double weight;</l>
            <l>Jake, in the dark, will fret and scowl;</l>
            <l>Joe swears that he sees like an owl;</l>
            <l>Jake's house is cramped and still with gloom;</l>
            <l>Joe makes a palace of one room;</l>
            <l>Jake's apple always has a blight;</l>
            <l>Joe finds a ripe spot he can bite--</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Jake with the "rheumatiz" will yell;</l>
            <l>Joe has it, but he's "getting well!"</l>
            <l>Jake's so inclined to doubt and scoff</l>
            <l>That all his joy is one-half off,</l>
            <l>But Joe--well, he don't lie, you know,</l>
            <l>But everything is more than so;</l>
            <l>His glowing gift of fancy's such,</l>

            <l>'Indeed," she told the druggist's clerk, "I don't know what to do--</l>
            <l>These patent remedies hold risks of which I never knew;</l>
            <l>This week I've read of lots of them and find that alcohol</l>
            <l>Is made the base--how terrible!--of nearly each and all."</l>
            <l>The druggist's clerk said that the doctors frowned on competition;</l>
            <l>However, that it might be well to exercise discretion.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>But can you tell," she asked the clerk with something like a shrug,</l>
            <l>"If I am apt to get a craze for spirits or for drug?</l>
            <l>I shudder when I think of how I may be tempting fate,</l>
            <l>And possibly become a slave to drink or opiate."</l>
            <l>The clerk remarked: "I know it's true the magazines abuse 'em,</l>
            <l>But as to all these remedies, there's lots of people use 'em."</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l> She bit her lips, she frowned, and thought, she rubbed her dimpled chin,</l>


            <pb id="VAA9485-106" n="104"/>

            <l>Then sighed in fretful wise and said: "I'd think it was a sin</l>
            <l>If I should"--then upon the soap and powder case she leaned--</l>
            <l>"If I should wake an appetite and be a liquor fiend!"</l>
            <l>The clerk said: "Really, Miss, there's folks that go and get a habit</l>
            <l>From using stuff that wouldn't phase the make up of a rabbit."</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>"Well, if you're sure," she murmured then, "I really think that I</l>
            <l>Will, just this once, test what I have been often urged to try."</l>
            <l>The clerk turned to the shelf of cures and asked "Which is it, please?"</l>
            <l>His hand uplifted, ready on the chosen one to seize.</l>
            <l>She blushed and said: "My family, my closest friends and pastor</l>

          <lg>
            <l>"Tell you a tale o' the sea? I will;</l>
            <l>Come gather around," said Uncle Bill.</l>
            <l>Then Jacky and Jenny climbed one on each knee</l>
            <l>To hear all this marvelous tale of the sea:</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>"'Twas when I was out on the Nancy Q.</l>
            <l>A-roamin' around on the ocean blue</l>
            <l>That happened this incident strange and true.</l>
            <l>The Nancy was makin' for land one day</l>
            <l>When suddenly there was the deuce to pay</l>
            <l>Where all o' the trip had been blithe an' gay.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>"We stuck on the slope of a mighty wave,</l>
            <l>Though many a stagger the Nancy gave</l>
            <l>It seemed we were bound for a watery grave.</l>
            <l>The wind, don't you see, was from dead ahead;</l>
            <l>The current, as doubtless you may have read,</l>
            <l>Was runnin' the other way instead.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>"The Nancy would climb to about the top</l>
            <l>Then seem to give up, and would slowly drop;</l>
            <l>She slid to the bottom of that there hill--</l>
            <l>Or billow, or wave--and she'd then stand still</l>
            <l>Till the current would carry her up, an' then,</l>
            <l>By ginger, she'd simply slide down again!</l>
          </lg>

          <pb id="VAA9485-108" n="106"/>
          <lg>
            <l>"So back'ards an' for'ards she slid five weeks,</l>
            <l>An' never a schooner the captain speaks;</l>
            <l>It seemed like the ocean was bleak an' bare</l>
            <l>For nobody else but ourselves was there;</l>
            <l>We slid an' we clumb, an' we clumb an' slid</l>
            <l>Until--well, we pretty near starved, we did!</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>"The captain he wept, an' the second mate</l>
            <l>Ast me what to do for to get things straight,</l>
            <l>Then I told the mate of a litle plan</l>
            <l>An' he said that I was a brainy man.</l>
            <l>We all got behind and we pushed the ship</l>
            <l>Till she mounted the wave an' resumed her trip.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>"The captain said I was both wise an' bold--</l>
            <l>But somehow I caught quite an awful cold,</l>
            <l>And never again would your uncle choose</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Bill Hicks had asthma--he would swear</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">With each recurring paroxysm.</l>
            <l>He cured it--lived out in the air,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And that gave him the rheumatism.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>The doctors cured his rheumatiz--</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Of that there never was a question.</l>
            <l>Strong acids stopped those pains of his</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">But left him ill with indigestion.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Dyspepsia fled before a course</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Of eating grain. (It would delight us</l>
            <l>To cheer this scheme till we were hoarse,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">But Bill then had appendicitis.)</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>He rallied from the surgeon's knife</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And laid six weeks without a quiver;</l>
            <l>The operation saved his life--</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">The loafing, though, knocked out his liver.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>To cure his liver troubles he</l>
            <l rend="ti-1"> Took muscle stunts--you know how they go.</l>
            <l>From liver ills he then was free</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">But all the strains gave him lumbago.</l>
          </lg>

          <pb id="VAA9485-110" n="108"/>
          <lg>
            <l>Lumbago is a painful thing--</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">A masseuse with a visage solemn</l>
            <l>Rubbed the lumbago out by spring</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">But twisted poor Bill's spinal column.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>To rid his backbone of the twist</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">They used some braces--they were careless--</l>
            <l>The padding for his head they missed;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">They made him straight and left him hairless</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Drugs were prescribed to grow his hair;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">These acted just as represented,</l>
            <l>But through some woeful lack of care</l>
            <l rend="ti-1"> They soaked in, and left him demented.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Then to a sanitarium</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">They took poor Bill, and he was treated;</l>
            <l>His brain with health began to hum--</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Next asthma! Ward was poorly heated!</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>"More open air," the doctors said,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">But Hicks cried: "No, you cannot lure me.</l>
            <l>I'll stay right here upon my bed</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And shoot the man that tries to cure me!"</l>

          <head rend="center">THE EDUCATED BEE</head>

          <lg>
            <l>Gillicuddy Migglebury had an educated bee--</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">A humble bee, in truth, but very talented was he;</l>
            <l>Gillicuddy taught him music till he sang in any key,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1"> And his name was Fuzzy Wuzzy--he was fuzzy, don't you see?</l>
            <l rend="ti-2"> Was he fuzzy? Yes, he was.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Gillicuddy Migglebury took this humble bee to church</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And he let the bee go seeking for a comfortable perch.</l>
            <l>Now the bee went to the choir loft in its aimless, restless search,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And among the singer's bonnets he began to loaf and lurch--</l>
            <l rend="ti-2">Was he lazy? Yes, he was.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>When the choir began to warble then the bee began to sing,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And he boomed a bass arrangement just as nice as anything--</l>
            <l>But the liquid-voiced soprano felt the rustle of his wing</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And she paused between the measures to say: "O, you awful thing!"</l>
            <l rend="ti-2">Was he awful? Yes, he was.</l>
          </lg>

          <pb id="VAA9485-112" n="110"/>

          <lg>
            <l>Now, a bee, you know, has feelings (honest pride we must admire)</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And this bee was slightly angered by the spiteful singer's ire,</l>
            <l>So he answered with his stinger to that singer in the choir</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And she shrieked a shriek of terror and she yelled a yell of "Fire!"</l>
            <l rend="ti-2">Was she fiery? Yes, she was.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Then the others lost the motif of the anthem they had sung,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And their books in frenzied swiftness at the bumble bee they flung,</l>
            <l>While about their heads, delighted, in the atmosphere he hung</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And he bumbled and he grumbled and he rumbled, and he stung!</l>
            <l rend="ti-2">Was he busy? Yes, he was.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Seeing all this tense excitement, straight the minister arose</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And attempted to dissuade the choir from all its throws and throes,</l>
            <l>But the bee came down upon him like a warrior on his foes</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And he got the dominie a dab upon his Roman nose.</l>
            <l rend="ti-2">Was he nosey? Yes, he was.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>O, the tumult they created floated out across the town</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And was heard by the fire marshal, Mr. William Henry Brown,</l>

            <pb id="VAA9485-113" n="111"/>

            <l>Who post-hasted to the church and with a grave, official frown,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Ordered all, the bee included, that they instantly sit down.</l>
            <l rend="ti-2">Was he sitting? Yes, he was.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>That is all--the bee was captured, we are very glad to tell,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">By his master, Migglebury, who returned him to his cell--</l>
            <l>But they say that when the preacher felt the sting and gave his yell</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">He referred to a location which it's not polite to spell.</l>
            <l rend="ti-2"> Was he burning? Yes, he was.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Gillicuddy Migglebury had an educated bee--</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Just a humble bumble bee that sang in almost any key;</l>
            <l>But he never ever afterward joined in the harmony</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Of the choir that sang the anthems for a high artistic fee.</l>
            <l rend="ti-2">Was he wicked ? Yes, he was.</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Why is it no one ever tries</l>
            <l>To learn who 'twas invented pies?</l>
            <l>What woman, beautiful and just,</l>
            <l>First rolled, and pinched, and cut the crust,</l>
            <l>And, to alleviate distress,</l>
            <l>Filled it with pungent happiness?</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>First, there is juicy apple pie--</l>
            <l>For this did Father Adam sigh.</l>
            <l>It was no apple, red and sweet,</l>
            <l>That led astray his halting feet--</l>
            <l>It must have been an apple pie</l>
            <l>That loomed before his longing eye.</l>
            <l>Such pie--such apple pie, forsooth,</l>
            <l>As folks remember from their youth--</l>
            <l>A pie with prinked and crumpled edge,</l>
            <l>Each slice of which would make a wedge</l>
            <l>To fetch one's good intent apart</l>
            <l>From any clutch on mind or heart;</l>
            <l>It is no wonder, after all,</l>
            <l>That Adam was inclined to fall.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Then, there are chicken pie, and lamb.</l>
            <l>And oyster, mutton, veal-and-ham,</l>



            <pb id="VAA9485-119" n="115"/>

            <l>And currant and gooseberry pie,</l>
            <l>Blackberry, prune, and cherry pie,</l>
            <l>Peach, plum, and sweet potato pie--</l>
            <l>Say, ever eat tomato pie?</l>
            <l>Tomato pie? Almost unknown,</l>
            <l>Yet it deserves a pastry throne</l>
            <l>For when it glows aright we see</l>
            <l>The purple robe of royalty;</l>
            <l>And, O, the taste and tang of it</l>
            <l>When by a hungry human bit!</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Such stuff as dreams! Aye, dreams like these:</l>
            <l>That comets are the bits of cheese</l>
            <l>And all the planets in the sky,</l>
            <l>And little stars, are luscious pie!</l>
            <l>Our hearts in gladness to immerse</l>
            <l>By eating through the universe!</l>
            <l>O, one should never criticise</l>
            <l>The sober souls who scoff at pies,</l>
            <l>Whose views of pie are dark and grim,</l>
            <l>For they leave so much pie for him !</l>
            <l>Come, build a tablet; set it high:</l>
            <l>"To Him or Her Who First Made Pie."</l>

            <l>Again, to honor custom's due</l>
            <l>He must provide much revenue.</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Howdy, Mr. Winter! If it isn't you again!</l>
            <l>Haven't had a visit from you since I dunno when.</l>
            <l>Though I heard you laughin'--must 'a' been a week ago--</l>
            <l>When the north wind shouted just as it began to blow;</l>
            <l>Thought I heard you chuckle when the grass was turned to brown</l>
            <l>An' the withered flowers lost their holt an' fluttered down.</l>
            <l>Hear you at the window; hear you in the chimney, too--</l>
            <l>Howdy, Mister Winter; howdy, howdy do!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>See the leaves a-racin' down the middle o' the street,</l>
            <l>Leapin' an' a-dancin' like they all was bound to beat</l>
            <l>Jumpin' far an' fu'ther till they're scattered roundabout--</l>
            <l>Some gives up an' falters like they was all tuckered out;</l>
            <l>They all know you're comin', and they rustle from the trees</l>
            <l>Catchin' in their hurry to the fingers of the breeze</l>
            <l>Worryin' an' scurryin' to get away from you--</l>

          <lg>
            <l>We talk about the Simple Life as though 'twere something new,</l>
            <l>As though we've just discovered what ideal to pursue,</l>
            <l>Yet old Isaiah Perkins, who expired in '83,</l>
            <l>Had formed a creed of life that was as simple as could be.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Long, long ago, all through the year, Isaiah Perkins went</l>
            <l>With one blithe measure on his lips--his song of pure content;</l>
            <l>He softly sang this ballad, which it seems he thought would give</l>
            <l>His biasless opinion on the way that one should live:</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>"What do I care for gold an' silver, all the money that's in this land?</l>
            <l>Gi' me a wife an' fourteen childer', a old gray hoss an' a peanut stand." </l>
            <l>This takes all modern questions--all the problems we discuss--</l>
            <l>And answers them completely; and it should appeal to us.</l>
          </lg>


          <pb id="VAA9485-144" n="140"/>


          <lg>
            <l>You note that Greed and Mammon are out-spokenly decried</l>
            <l>And that it deprecates in forceful terms Race Suicide.</l>

            <l>And so, when from the platform or from oracles of state</l>
            <l>Philosophy is flung about in words of worth and weight,</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>And there are rules of life laid down for guiding you and me,</l>
            <l>We hum Isaiah Perkins' song--he died in '83:</l>

            <l>"What do I care for gold an' silver, all the money that's in this land?</l>
            <l>Gi' me a wife an' fourteen childer', a old gray hoss, an' a peanut stand."</l>

          <p rend="center"> (A<hi rend="sc">BRAHAM</hi> L<hi rend="sc">INCOLN</hi> C<hi rend="sc"
              >ENTRE</hi>, 1905.) </p>

          <lg>
            <l>And what is this you dedicate? Is it the brick and stone?</l>
            <l>These walls set high and fair--do you but build these walls alone?</l>
            <l>Is it that you would dedicate this work that you have done,</l>
            <l>Or consecrate the structure of great deeds that is begun?</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>We may fold hands and look at this, and know that it is good,</l>
            <l>And praise the marvels that are wrought of senseless stone and wood,</l>
            <l>But we must go bare-armed and strong from labor made complete</l>
            <l>To all the harder, longer tasks we know that we must meet.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>The perfect house is not made up of roof and wall and floor--</l>
            <l>The perfect house bids welcome or cries Godspeed at door--</l>



            <pb id="VAA9485-146" n="142"/>

            <l>Its builders labor on in love, are spendthrift of their strength</l>
            <l>Until the house shall stand in simple majesty at length.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>It is the house not made with hands, not built of stone and steel,</l>
            <l>Whose base is the great common thought that all of us must feel,</l>
            <l>Whose clear design but follows out the one eternal plan</l>
            <l>That they who work in brotherhood must know their brother man.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>That they who work in brotherhood, who build with word and deed,</l>
            <l>Toil on a structure which outgrows the confines of a creed,</l>
            <l>Raise up a temple wonderful beneath the blessed skies--</l>
            <l>A temple as enduring as the truth that never dies.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Build on. Build high and true and fair, throughout the changing years,</l>
            <l>And light shall break where darkness broods, and smiles take place of tears.</l>
            <l>The blessing of a worthy deed is that its lustre glows</l>
            <l>Like sunbeams coaxing laughter to the dewdrops on the rose.</l>
          </lg>



          <pb id="VAA9485-147" n="143"/>


          <lg>
            <l>So, you have built--but still you build, and not with brick and beams,</l>
            <l>For you shall breathe the breath of life into your cherished dreams,</l>
            <l>And you shall see your faith take form again, and yet again,</l>
            <l>For you build more than temples--Aye, for you are building men!</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>And what is this we dedicate? Not roof and floor and wall,</l>
            <l>But the brave trust in that white light which leads us one and all;</l>
            <l>We consecrate our hope and faith in this that has been done</l>
            <l>And dedicate ourselves anew to what is but begun. </l>

          <lg>
            <l>As a ribbon flung out from a generous hand,</l>
            <l>Till it loops in its leagues the fair heart of the land,</l>
            <l>So the river--The Father of Waters--is flung</l>
            <l>From the place where the pines by the north winds are swung.</l>
            <l>From the stillness and peace of the whispering lakes</l>
            <l>To the shore where the sea in its majesty breaks.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>And it murmurs for miles or it leaps in its strength</l>
            <l>Or it coils as a lariat coiled on its length,</l>
            <l>And it stops for a space with its eddying whirls</l>
            <l>While its form spins about as a garland of pearls</l>
            <l>And it sings in the sun and it dreams in the moon</l>
            <l>As it races in joy from the falls to lagoon.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>It has mirrored the banners of crimson and gold</l>
            <l>That were borne by adventurers dauntlessly bold</l>
            <l>Who were winning new realms and were finding new ways</l>
            <l>Through the green of the forest and gray of the haze</l>
            <l>That was spread on the prairie and wreathed on the hill</l>
            <l>When the courage of Spain was at one with its will.</l>
          </lg>



          <pb id="VAA9485-149" n="145"/>


          <lg>
            <l>It has laughed with the lightly wrought lilies of France</l>
            <l>As the flag kept the time to the lilt of the dance</l>
            <l>When the noblemen came, and the beautiful maids</l>
            <l>Sang the ballads of old in the hush of the glades,</l>
            <l>And it knows of the days that were gentle and calm</l>
            <l>When the lilies of France nodded over the palm.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>It has run with a red--not a red of the dawn,</l>
            <l>But the red flood of war in the days that are gone</l>
            <l>When its bosom was swept by the shot and the shell</l>
            <l>And the smoke of the war was the vapor of hell</l>
            <l>That blew low on its surface and hid hulls and spars</l>
            <l>When the stars and the stripes met the stars and the bars.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>But today, as majestic as ages ago,</l>
            <l>From the hills of the north to the valleys below,</l>
            <l>As a ribbon that binds the palmetto and pine,</l>
            <l>As a bond that is set from the gulf to the line--</l>
            <l>As an artery throbbed by the pulse of the land,</l>
            <l>So the river flows on, ever stately and grand.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>And the centuries come and the centuries go,</l>
            <l>But the river--The Father of Waters--shall flow</l>
            <l>As the ointment of old from the ewer was spilled</l>
            <l>On the place where the Lord said the builders should build.</l>
            <l>Aye, the great Mississippi, majestic and calm,</l>
            <l>Has endured, shall endure, as a blessing and balm.</l>

            <l>My fat friend's smile! It's a homely phrase,</l>
            <l>But it takes me back to the other days--</l>
            <l>To the other days, when the heart was young</l>
            <l>And its saddest songs were as yet unsung.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>'Twas a cheery smile; I can see it yet,</l>
            <l>With the twinkling mirth I can not forget--</l>
            <l>How it dimpled out till it blent for me</l>
            <l>In a map of the Land of Jollity!</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>You knew when you saw its rippling start</l>
            <l>From his laughing eyes, it was full of heart;</l>
            <l>It was full of heart as a smile could be--</l>
            <l>The sort of smile that is good to see.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>My fat friend's smile! Ah, it's good to know</l>

            <l>And it brightens many a weary while</l>

            <l>I want to hear a murmur down the distance of the street--</l>
            <l>A mild and mellow murmur with a rythm in its beat;</l>
            <l>To hear it growing stronger as the melody comes near</l>

          <lg>
            <l>I'm hungry today, with a shadowy kind</l>
            <l>Of a hunger for what I will never more find--</l>
            <l>A hunger that hints at a feast of delight,</l>
            <l>But I know if I ate, that it wouldn't taste right,</l>
            <l>That it wouldn't be rich with the tang and the zest</l>
            <l>That it had in the days when it tasted the best,</l>
            <l>For in fact or in fancy I know I'd find fault--</l>
            <l>Yet I'm hungry today for green apples and salt.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>If I only had freckles, and snarls in my hair,</l>
            <l>And one front tooth missing, and both my feet bare,</l>
            <l>And just one suspender, and pants that were torn,</l>
            <l>And a hickory hat that was tattered and worn,</l>
            <l>And a collarless shirt that was ripped in the sleeves,</l>
            <l>Then I'd find all the joy that each urchin receives</l>
            <l>When the orchard fence he will go o'er with a vault</l>
            <l>And be ready to feast on green apples and salt.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l> Green apples! The puckery crab had a snap</l>
            <l>And an acidy nip that was good for a chap,</l>
            <l>But the old harvest apple--it's at its best now</l>
            <l>When between green and ripe it swings low from the bough</l>
            <l>And teases and coaxes and dares you to eat!</l>



            <pb id="VAA9485-157" n="153"/>

            <l>The green harvest apple is one you can't beat;</l>
            <l>There isn't a boy that it cannot make halt</l>
            <l>If he likes--and who doesn't?--green apples and salt.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>And I'm hungry today with a ghost of desire,</l>
            <l>With a shadowy craving that seems to inquire</l>
            <l>If I'm losing my hold on the best that I knew,</l>
            <l>On the fun of my boydays, and appetite, too!</l>
            <l>And I want to be out in the world of the trees,</l>
            <l>In the world of the boys and the birds and the bees--</l>
            <l>But I know that my fancy would find me at fault</l>

          <lg>
            <l>We found it in the attic where it long had lain away;</l>
            <l>The dust had veiled the letters in a shroud of misty gray,</l>
            <l>A spider's web was tangled in its odd fantastic weaves</l>
            <l>Across the frame whose corners were hand carved in oaken leaves.</l>
            <l>The old, discarded motto--it was worked in green and red</l>
            <l>On perforated cardboard, and "God Bless Our Home" it said.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Crude, homely, and old-fashioned is this relic of the past;</l>
            <l>Once thought a thing of beauty but now flung aside at last--</l>
            <l>Yet now the faded colors that the quaint old letters bear</l>
            <l>Seem as the afterglowing of the quiet days that were--</l>
            <l>The days whose every twilight from frettings brought release,</l>
            <l>And stars swept through the silence that held a Sabbath peace.</l>

            <l>The face of one whose gentle smile was meant for you and me;</l>
            <l>And then the dim old parlor that opened from the hall</l>

            <l rend="ti-1">Still on and up and down,</l>

            <l>My eyes look on, my lips are mute,</l>

            <l rend="ti-1">And the wrinkles of his grin;</l>

            <l>And I thrust him varletwise</l>

          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Then I sat, and sat alone</l>

            <l rend="ti-1">Rang a laugh that gave me word</l>
            <l>Pleasure had a new abode;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">'Twas his hollow laugh I heard.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>There came one full silently,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Calm of face and sweet of eyes,</l>

            <l rend="ti-1">While I looked up with surprise.</l>
            <l>"Stranger," begged I, "linger here</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">For your heart alone is true."</l>
            <l>"I have waited year on year,"</l>
