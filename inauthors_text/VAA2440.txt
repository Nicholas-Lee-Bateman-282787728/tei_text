                The Guardian
                
                    ACT I
                    
                        Terrace of the Hotel Regina Margherita, on the cliff at
                            Sorrento, overlooking the Bay of Naples.
                    
                        Back drop shows the bay and semi-circular coast-line, dotted
                            with villages, and Vesuvius gray in the distance. Across the stage at
                            back runs a marble balustrade about three feet high, guarding the edge
                            of the cliff. From up L. C. (meeting upper L. end of railing) the wall
                            of the hotel runs obliquely down to L. where it corners, and runs into
                            foliage wing down L. leaving an entrance there from wings. A door
                            (closed but practicable) in front wall of hotel affords entrance down L.
                            to hotel. This door is of modern Italian style: glass nearly to base,
                            with lace shade. A single step is before the door, which is not on the
                            same level as the doors up L., which are large glass double-doors,
                            forming main entrance from the hotel to the terrace. They are approached
                            by four or five marble steps with railing and small stoop. Windows in
                            Wall L. C. and down L. above door.  Awnings
                            shield all of them. The hotel is of pink and white stucco. R. of stage
                            is a grove, betokened by shrubberies and tree-wings. Two or three small
                            white wicker tea-tables L. Wicker chairs near them. Couple of covered
                            Bath chairs broadly striped with pink and white, up R. near balustrade.
                            Down R. C. is square table laid with white cloth.
                    
                        Time: Eleven o'clock in the morning; stage
                        bright.
                    
                        Before the curtain rises mandolines and guitars are heard and
                            the Fisherman's Song, time very rapid and gay, the musicians
                            being off R.
                    MARIANO, matre d'hotel, is
                            discovered laying the table down R. C. with eggs, coffee and rolls for
                            two. He is a pleasant-faced, elderly man, stout, swarthy, wearing long
                            gray mutton-chop side whiskers; dress clothes, white waistcoat, and
                            black tie. He is annoyed by the music off R.
                    
                        MARIANO
                        (as curtain rises, looking off R. crossly).
                        Silenzio!
                        MICHELE
                            opens doors from hotel up L. and appears on stoop. He is
                                young, clean-shaven except for a dark mustache, wears a white tie, a
                                blue coat, cut like dress-coat, blue 
                                trousers with red side stripes, brass buttons; his waistcoat is of
                                striped red and blue.
                    
                    
                        MICHELE
                        (speaking over his shoulder to L. but indicating
                                MARIANO
                            with his right hand).
                        Par ici, Monsieur Ribiere, pour le Matre d'hotel.
                        RIBIERE
                            enters from the doors up L., crossing MICHELE
                            on stoop. MICHELE
                            not descending steps, immediately withdraws as he has
                                entered, through doors, leaving them open. RIBIERE
                            is a trim, business-like young Frenchman, of some
                                distinction of appearance. He wears a well-made English dark
                                "cutaway" walking-suit, a derby hat and carries a
                                handsome leather writing-case under his arm. The scene is
                            quick.
                    
                    
                        RIBIERE
                        (as he enters).
                        Ah, Mariano! (Comes down R. C.)
                        
                    
                    
                        MARIANO
                        (bowing and greeting him gaily).
                        Monsieur Ribiere! J'espre que vous tes(He
                                    breaks off, turns on his heel toward the invisible musicians off
                                    R. and shouts.) Silenzio! (He
                                    turns again quickly to Ribiere.)
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        RIBIERE
                        (with a warning glance toward hotel).
                        Let us speak English. There are not so many who understand. (Both speak with a slight accent.)
                        
                    
                    
                        MARIANO
                        (politely).
                        I hope Monsieur still occupy the exalt' position of
                            secretar' to Monseigneur the Grand Duke.
                    
                    
                        RIBIERE
                        (sits R. C. and opens writing case, answers
                            gravely).

                        MARIANO
                        (at table, with gesture and accent of
                            despair).
                        Again incognito! Every year he come to our hotel for two, three day, but
                            always incognito. (He finishes setting the
                                    table.) We lose the honor to have it known.
                    
                    
                        RIBIERE
                        (looking at watch).
                        He comes in his automobile from Naples. Everything is to be as on my
                            employer's former visitsstrictly incognito. It is understood

                        RIBIERE
                        (continuing).
                        He wishes to be thought a German. (Takes a notebook
                                    from case).
                        
                    
                    
                        MARIANO
                        (as though asking a question).
                        Such a man! of caprice? Excentrique? (as if answering
                                    it) Ha!
                    
                    
                        RIBIERE
                        (emphatically and as if with despair).
                        You have said it. Last night he talked by chance to a singular North
                            American in the hotel at Napoli. To-day he has that stranger for
                            companion in the automobile. I remonstrate. What use? He laugh for half
                            an hour! (Makes a gesture of humorous desperation
                                    and closes the writing case with a snap, leaving notebook
                                    outside of it.)
                        
                    
                    
                        MARIANO.
                        He is not like those cousin of his at St. Petersburgh an'
                            Moscowa. An' yet though Monseigneur is so good an'
                            generoso, will not the anarchist strike against the name of royalty
                            himself? You have not the fear?
                    
                    
                    
                        RIBIERE.
                        I have. He has not.
                            (Opens notebook.) I take what
                            precaution I can secretly from him. You have few guests?

                        (smiling).
                        It is so early in the season. Those poor musician' (nodding off R.) they wait always at every
                            gate, to play when they see anyone coming. There is only seex peoples in
                            the 'ole house! All of one party.

                            rapidly proceed to set. A valetde-chambre enters up L. following them
                            immediately. He is a smooth-shaven man in plain black sack suit, smooth
                            black hair, neat white bow tie. His waistcoat black, striped with red,
                            cut high at the throat. He carries a tray with a silver dish of caviar
                            and a bottle of Vodka. As he enters he hesitates for one moment, looking
                            inquiringly at RIBIERE, 
                        who motions him quickly toward MARIANO

                            the table, and exits up L. The others pay no attention to any of
                            this.

                                    enters up L. He is a portly man of forty-five, but rather
                                    soldierly than fat. His hair, pompadour, is reddish blonde,
                                    beginning to turn gray, like his mustache and large full beard;
                                    the latter somewhat "Henri IV." and slightly
                                    forked at bottom. His dress produces the effect rather of
                                    carelessness than of extreme fashion. He wears a travelling suit
                                    of light gray or brownish tweeds, or Irish homespuns, neat
                                    enough but not freshly pressed, trousers showing no crease, the

                                    silver cigarette case full of Russian cigarettes. He wears
                                    russet shoes with tan spats, shirt, collar and cuffs of soft
                                    cheviot of light shade, four-in-hand tie, darker; on his head a

                                    by RIBIERE, who is anxious
                                    and perturbed and wishes to call his attention to the item in

                        bows submissively, though with a gesture of protest, and exit
                            doors up L. The group L have watched VASILI
                        with hostility, and immediately upon the conclusion of this
                            speech, Lady Creech speaks.

                            and places  it upon stool behind
                        table. VASILI
                        sits. In speaking VASILI
                        employs an accent so light as to be scarcely
                        detected.

                    PIKE
                        enters up L. immediately on the speeches of VASILI
                        and ETHEL. He is a
                            youthful looking American of about thirty-five, good-natured, shrewd,
                            humorous and kindly. His voice has the homely quality of the central
                            states, clear, quiet, and strong, with a very slight drawl at times when
                            the situation strikes him as humorous; often exhibiting an apologetic
                            character of tone. He does not speak a dialect in the strict sense. His
                            English is the United States language as spoken by the average citizen
                            to be met on a day coach anywhere in the central states. He is clean
                            shaven, and his hair, which shows a slight tendency to gray, is neatly
                            parted on the left side. His brown straw hat is tall-crowned with a
                            medium brim, the latter edged with a thin strip of black, and a narrow
                            black ribbon around the crown. The hat, like the rest of his apparel, is
                            neither new nor old. His shirt, "lay-down" collar and
                            cuffs, are of white, well-laundered linen. He wears a black string tie.
                            He wears instead of a  coat a linen
                            (perhaps pongee) duster, extending to the knees. It is not of a
                            fashionable cut, does not suggest an auto-wrap, but it is not
                            unbecoming, nor does it grotesquely fail to fit him. His waistcoat, cut
                            medium low, is of a gray mixture, neither dark nor light. His trousers
                            are of the same material and not fashionably cut, but they fit him well
                            and are neither baggy at the knees nor high-water. His shoes are plain
                            black Congress gaiters and show a good shine. In brief he is just the
                            average well-to-do but untravelled citizen that you might meet on the
                            accommodation train between Logansport and Kokomo, Indiana. As he enters
                            he is wiping his face after his ablutions, with a large towel, his hat
                            pushed far back on his head. The sleeves of his duster are turned back,
                            and his detachable cuffs are in the pocket of his duster. He comes
                            through the doors rubbing his face with the towel, but pausing for a
                            moment on the stoop, drops the towel from his face to dry his hands. All
                            except VASILI
                        and the waiters staring at him with frowns of
                        annoyance.
                    
                    
                        PIKE.
                        (beamingly unconscious of this, surprised, and in a tone
                                of cheerful apology, believing all the world to be as good-natured
                                and sensible as Kokomo would be under the
                            circumstances).
                        Law! I didn't know there was folks here. I reckon
                            you'll have to excuse me. (As he speaks he
                                    dries his hands quickly.) Here, son! (He hands the towel to MICHELE,
                                    who places it over one arm. PIKE
                                rapidly descends steps, goes R. to table, taking chair
                                    L. of table. MICHELE
                                holds his position on stoop until PIKE
                                has passed him, then follows to the table and serves
                                    him, MARIANO
                                attending VASILI. As PIKE
                                crosses and sits, he takes cuffs from pocket of duster,
                                    adjusts them and turns down sleeves. MICHELE
                                takes his hat.

                            crosses).
                        You're a true patriot, my friend. You allow no profane hand to
                            cook your national dish. I trust you will be as successful with that
                            wicked motor of mine.

                            annoyance at PIKE. LADY CREECH
                        lets her periodical rest in her lap, and without any abating or
                            concealment, fixes PIKE
                        with a basilisk glare which continues. He is unconscious of all
                            this, his back being three-quarters to their group. MME DE C.
                        and ETHEL
                        sit in Bath chairs at back up R. and converse, also now and
                            then giving signs of annoyance at PIKE.
                    
                        VASILI
                        (no pause).
                        You have studied mechanics at the University?
                    
                    
                        PIKE

                        University? Law, no! On the old man's farm. (VASILI
                                nods gravely.)

                        Without any disrespect to you, my dear fellow, what terrific bounders
                            most of your fellow-countrymen are!

                        Not at all, my dear lad.
                    
                    
                        VASILI
                        (to PIKE).
                        Can I persuade you to accept a little of one of my own national

                        Caviar? I've heard of it; I thought it was Rooshian.
                    
                    
                        VASILI
                        (disturbed but instantly recovering
                            himself).
                        It is German, also. Will you not? (He motions

                                to serve PIKE.) MARIANO
                            places a spoonful of caviar on a silver dish at PIKE'S
                            right. PIKE
                            is sitting three-fourths front.

                        I expect I'd never get to the legislature again if the boys
                            heard about it. Still I reckon I'm far enough from home to take
                            a few risks. (As he loads a fork with caviar and
                                    with a smile places it in his mouth. The smile slowly fades, his
                                    face becomes thoughtful, then grave he slowly sets the fork upon
                                    his plate, his eyes turn toward VASILI
                                with a look both puzzled and plaintive, his mouth
                                    firmly closed, his jaw moving slightly.)

                                    a clean glass.) A few swallows of vodka will take
                            away the taste. (Gives him the glass, which
                                    PIKE
                                quickly and gravely accepts, drinking a mouthful in
                                    haste, VASILI
                                watching him, sincerely concerned and troubled.

                                swallows the vodka, quietly sets the glass down on the
                                    table, his eyelids begin to flutter, bends a look of suffering
                                    and distrust upon VASILI, slowly rises and closes his eyes, then slowly sits and opens
                                    them. Gradually a faint, distrustful smile appears on his
                                    face.)

                                    his head slowly, turning his head until his eyes meet those
                                    of LADY CREECH, and smiling but ruefully shakes his head at her as if
                                    sure of her sympathy. She snorts with indignation and turns
                                    toward HAWCASTLE
                                and HORACE, to see
                                    if they have witnessed the outrage. PIKE
                                fails to observe this, as he has immediately turned
                                    again to VASILI.

                        up R. pointing it out to ETHEL.

                                folds napkin).
                        No sir, you wouldn't catch me puttin' in any time in
                            these old kingdoms unless I had to.

                        (loudly and crossly to HAW).
                        Hawcastle, can you tell me how much longer these persons intend to remain
                            here listening to our conversation?

                        looks keenly at group L. frowning slightly. PIKE
                        half turns to LADY CR.
                        innocently puzzled, sets his napkin on table. MARIANO, bowing, gives him his hat, then
                            attends VASILI, standing R. of him,
                            holding his cap. MICHELE

                        I had a distinct impression that the management had reserved this terrace

                        I will ask her if she will consent to an interview.
                    
                    VASILI, who has been watching keenly,
                            makes a gesture to MARIANO, who
                            gives him his cap,  bowing deeply. Makes a
                            gesture for MARIANO

                        bows and exits up L. quickly.

                        I am Miss Granger-Simpson. (She is L. and a little

                            he'd have a girl like you!

                                    step nearer her.) He'd a been mighty proud

                        I expect you thought I'd neglected you a good deal (remorsefully), and it did LOOK like itnever comin' to see you; but I
                            couldn't hardly manage the time to get away. You see,

                            marrying.

                        expression becomes puzzled, he passes his hand over his chin,
                            looks at her keenly. Then his eyes turn R. C. to the spot where

                            made such a proposition to you? He'll take the old man out in

                        Back drop shows green slopes of vineyards, castle, and olive
                            orchards leading up the mountain side.
                    
                    
                        At back an old stone wall seven feet high runs from up L. C.
                            across stage to up R. This wall is almost covered with vines, showing
                            autumn tints, crowning the crest of the wall and hanging from it in
                            profusion. In the wall up C. is a broad green gate of the Southern
                            Italian type, closed. From up R. a white-columned pergola runs obliquely
                            to down R. The top of the pergola is an awning formed by a skeleton of
                            green painted wooden strips thickly covered by entwining lemon branches
                            bearing ripening lemons. Between the columns of the pergolathat is, to
                            R.are glimpses of a formal Italian garden: flowers, hedges, and a broad
                            flat marble vase on a slender pedestal, etc. Up L. a two-story wing of
                            the hotel meets wall at the back and runs squarely across to tree-wings
                                 up L. The wall of the hotel facing R.
                            shows windows (not practicable), and is as short as can be made
                            plausible, the object being to throw the building up stage as far as
                            possible. The wall of the hotel facing audience shows open double doors
                            near its R. corner, with windows upstairs and below all with lowered
                            awnings. One window on upper floor as near L. extremity as possible, and
                            yet fully visible to audience, is practicable. One window on lower
                            floor, nearest double doors, is practicable. Boxes of flowers on the
                            ledges of all the windows, and along base of wall to hotel a narrow
                            strip of well-tended flowers, except where a single broad step leading
                            to doorway interrupts it. A Venetian well L. C. with wrought-iron
                            overwork, showing hanging chain. A marble bench down L. among
                            shrubberies; an open touring-car down R. under the awning formed by the
                            overhang of the pergola; bag of tools open on stage near-by, floor
                            boards of the car removed, apron lifted. As the curtain rises, PIKE
                        in shirt sleeves, his hands dirty, and wearing a
                            workman's long blue blouse, buttoned at neck, is bending over
                            I., side of engine, working and singing, at intervals whistling,
                            "The Blue and the Gray." His hat, duster and cuffs are

                            asked what our best game was. I told him we had some Incas still
                            preserved in the mountains of Indiana, and he said he'd like a
                            good Inca head to put up in his gun-room. He ought to get one

                        Your sister kind of let it out to me awhile ago that you think a good

                        Well, I thought you'd probably charge her (pauses and finishes with a slight drawl) a little,

                            herd. But can't you try to comprehend that there is an
                            old-world society, based not on wealth, but on that indescribable
                            something which comes of ancient lineage and high birth? (With great indignation.) You presume to

                            spoke of your father as a fine flower, but we thought a heap of him, and when he married your ma he was so glad to
                            get herwell, I never heard yet that he asked for any settlement!

                                him.)

                        Two companies of soldiers! A town marshal out my way would a had him
                            yesterday.
                    
                    
                        VASILI
                        (smiling).
                        My friend, you are teaching me to respect, your country, not by what you
                            brag, but by what you do.
                    
                    
                        PIKE.
                        How's that.
                    
                    
                        VASILI
                        (significantly).
                        I see how a son of that great democracy can apply himself to a dirty
                            machine, while his eyes are full of visions of one of its beautiful
                            daughters.
                    
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (slowly and sadly, peering into machine).
                        Doc., there's sand in your gear-box.
                    
                    
                        VASILI
                        (laughing).
                        So?
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (not looking up).
                        You go down to the kitchen and make signs for some of the help to give
                            you a nice clean bunch of rags.
                    
                    
                        VASILI
                        (surprised into hauteur).
                        What is it you ask me to do?
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (not noticing his tone, not looking up).
                        I need some more rags.
                    
                    
                        VASILI
                        (amused).
                        My friend, I obey. (Makes a mock-serious bow and
                                    starts L. PIKE
                                looking up and calling after him.)
                        
                    
                    
                        PIKE.
                        I won't leave the machine't wouldn't be
                            safe.
                    
                    
                        VASILI
                        (halting, laughs).
                        You fear this famous bandit would steal it?
                    
                    
                    
                        PIKE.
                        Nobut there's parties around here might think it was a
                            settlement.
                    
                    
                        VASILI.
                        I do not understand.
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (chuckling).
                        Doc., that's where we're in the same fix.
                    
                    
                        VASILI
                        (smiling).
                        Weidersehn, my friend. (Goes off L.)
                        
                    
                    PIKE
                        kneels on L. footboard of machine above gear-box, begins to
                            clean, using an old rag, singing "Sweet Genevieve." A
                            distant shot off R. PIKE
                        looks up at this, holding attitude for a second and ceasing his
                            song. Then continues his work and music. LADY C.
                            leans out from her window, staring off up R. with opera
                            glasses. There is a noise at gate up C. as if some one hastily, but
                            cautiously, tried to open it. PIKE
                        looks up again, turns toward gate, and, after a short pause,
                            again begins to sing and work, but very softly.
                    
                    IVANOFF
                        appears on top of wall up R. at back, as if climbing up
                            cautiously from lane below  creeps from
                            wall on to top of pergola and cautiously along top through the foliage
                            to above PIKE
                        down R. He peers over the foliage at PIKE.
                            PIKE
                        looks up slowly, and as slowly ceases "Sweet
                            Genevieve," his voice fading away on a half-syllable, as he
                            encounters IVANOFF'S
                        gaze. Pause while they stare at each other. LADY C. observing.
                    
                    IVANOFF
                        is a thin, very fragile-looking man, not tall, of thirty-eight.
                            His disordered hair is prematurely gray, his beard is a grizzled
                            four-day's stubble. He is exceedingly haggard and worn, but has
                            the face and look of a man of refinement and cultivation. He has lost
                            his hat, his shoes and trousers are splashed with dried mud, and
                            brambles cling to him here and there. He wears a soiled white shirt and
                            collar, and a torn black tie, black waistcoat and trousers. Is covered
                            with dust from head to foot, one sleeve of his shirt has been torn off
                            at the elbow. He wears no coat.
                    
                    
                        IVANOFF
                        (in a voice tremulous with tragic appeal).
                        Est ce que vous tes un homme de bon coeur? Je ne suis coupable
                    
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (very gravely).
                        There ain't any use in the world, your talkin' to me
                            like that!
                    
                    
                        IVANOFF
                        (panting).
                        You are an Englishman?
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (quietly, rising and stepping back).
                        That'll do for that. You come down from
                            there!
                    
                    
                        IVANOFF
                        (in a voice that lifts, almost cracks with sudden
                                hope).
                        An American?
                    
                    
                        PIKE.
                        They haven't made me anything else yet.
                    
                    
                        IVANOFF
                        (swinging himself down to the ground).
                        Thank God for that! (He leans against the car as if
                                    exhausted.)
                        
                    
                    
                        PIKE.
                        I do. What makes you so glad about it? (Dialogue very
                                    rapid and serious, though the voices are low.)
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        IVANOFF.
                        Because I have suffered in the cause your own forefathers gave their
                            lives for. I am a Russian political fugitive, and I can go no further.
                            If you give me up I shall not be taken alive. I have no weapon, but I
                            can find a way to cut my throat.
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (seriously, but with humorous incredulity).
                        Are you the ban-dit they're
                            lookin'for?
                    
                    
                        IVANOFF.
                        They call me that. Do I look like a bandit?
                    
                    
                        PIKE.
                        How close are they?
                    
                    
                        IVANOFF
                        (with despairing gesture up R. and L.).
                        There!
                    
                    
                        PIKE.
                        Did they see you climb that wall?
                    
                    
                        IVANOFF.
                        I think not.
                    
                    
                        Loud sharp ringing at gate up C. At the sound
                         IVANOFF
                        starts violently, throwing one arm up as if to shield his face
                            from a blow.
                    
                    
                        IVANOFF.
                        Oh, my God! it is they! (He staggers back against the
                                    machine.)
                        
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (hastily stripping off his working blouse).
                        Do you know anything about gear-box plugs? (The
                                    ringing continues.)
                        
                    
                    
                        IVANOFF.
                        Nothing in the world.
                    
                    
                        PIKE.
                        Then you're a chauffeur all right. (Puts
                                    blouse on him.) Take a look at this one(with emphatic significance). It's
                                underneath the machine. (Quickly sets his hands on IVANOFF'S shoulders, having forced the blouse on him, and pushes him
                                    beneath the car. All this very quick.)

                    PIKE
                        at same time rapidly wipes his hands on a clean rag in the
                            tonneau, puts on hat, cuffs, and duster, which have been lying on
                            seat.
                    
                    
                    
                        MARIANO

                            Vengo, vengo! (Hastens to gateway with key,
                                    unfastening it busily. Meanwhile PIKE lights
                                    cigar, stands L. of auto, his back to it, one foot raised, the
                                    heel resting on footboard, behind him, his arm carelessly

                            etc., are disclosed, their carbines slung over their arms, their long
                            cloaks thrown back. Behind the carab. stand some fishermen in red caps,
                            dirty flannel shirts of blue or gray, trousers rolled up to the knee,
                            also a few ragged beggars.

                        Murmur of voice from back arises, sounds of running feet and

                        runs back to gate, opens it, showing excited and clamoring
                            fishermen and beggars in the lane. They try to come in. He drives them
                            back with napkin, which has been hanging over his arm, crying,
                        "Vate, Vate! Devo dire al maresciallo di cacciarvi?" Stands up from gate in lane, continues business. Beggars and

                        I was condemned in Petersburg ten years ago. I was a professor of the
                            languages, a translator in the bureau of the Minister of Finance. I was
                            a member of the Society of the Blue Fifty, a constitutionalist.

                        I transferred funds of the government to the Society of the Blue Fifty.
                            Never one rouble for myself, (Throws open his blouse

                        (bitterly).
                        Through treachery. There was an Englishman who lived in Petersburgh. He
                            had contracts with the governmentI thought he was my best friend
                                    (laughs brokenly.) I had
                            married in my student days in Parisah, it is the old story! (bitterly) I knew that this Englishman
                            admired my wifeBut I trusted himas I trusted her, and he made my house
                            his home. I had fifty thousand roubles in my desk to be delivered to my
                            society. The police came to search; they found only mebut not my wife
                            nor my English friendnor the fifty thousand roubles! I went to Siberia.
                            Now I search for those two.

                        After they had taken the money and were beyond the frontier themselves.
                            That is all I have against them.

                        Why the man's down (seriously)
                            you wouldn't go back on him now. (With a
                                    half chuckle.) Besides you've made
                            yourself one of his confederates.

                            of you in the hotel at Napoli, I saw that you were a great man.

                            association with trade. He has spent so much of his life out of England

                                    window, glancing at it.) If you don't give
                            me the answer I want then-God help you! (Exits

                            Fishermen's song heard off R. very faint and distant to
                            curtain. After a pause PIKE
                        looks R., then quickly and quietly goes up to window nearest
                            door. Taps with his finger nails, shade is slowly raised and window is
                            opened by IVANOFF, who extends his
                            arm, meanwhile standing himself cautiously screened by wall of
                            room.)

                                    stands a Carabiniere in the bright moonlight. He slowly

                        SceneLate same evening, a handsome private salon in the hotel;
                            cabinets a gainst the walls, buhl tables, luxurious tapestried chairs,
                            etc. Walls panelled Louis XV. style. Large double door up R. in R. wall;
                            single door down R. in R. wall; both closed. Up L. in L. wall, handsome
                            fireplace with fire burning. Window down L. in L. wall, with lambrequins
                            and curtains. Up C. wide double doors, open; electric lights in sconces
                            round the walls; not lit. The only light in the salon comes from the
                            fire and the open doors up C., so that the room is dim. The open doors
                            up C., however, disclose a brilliantly lit conservatory hall, which
                            extends up stage as far as possible, showing amongst the plantspalms and
                            oleanders in bloom, etc.one or two small coffee tables with chairs.
                            Unseen and off L. an orchestra is playing (Pagliacci).
                    
                    
                        Rise of curtain discloses PIKE
                        sitting in dejected attitude before fire, but dimly seen. He
                            wears black tie, collar and linen as before, black trousers, black
                            waistcoat, cut rather low, and black frock coat"Western
                            statesman" style  not fashionably
                            cut, but well-fitting and graceful tightly buttoned at waist.

                        passes in conservatory at back from L. to R., bearing coffee
                            tray. LADY C.
                        in evening gown of black velvet and lace, follows with stately
                            tread. HORACE, in evening clothes,
                            follows with MME. DE C.
                        on his arm; she is in a handsome, very Parisian, decollete
                            dress. They are deep in tender conversation.
                    
                    PIKE
                        rises, looking up toward doors as they pass. ETHEL
                        passes L. to R. on arm of ALMERIC.
                        She wears a pretty evening gown, ALMERIC
                        in evening clothes; her head is bent and eyes cast down.
                            PIKE
                        stares at them as they pass, then goes to window down L. and
                            looks out. Pause. HAW
                        appears in conservatory hall at back. He seems about to pass
                            on, but gives a swift glance toward the salon, then makes a sign toward
                            off up R. MARIANO
                        returns with tray. HAW
                        signs him to put tray on small table at C. as far up toward
                            back drop as possible. He sits, lighting cigar. HORACE and MME. DE C.
                        return and join him at table. MARIANO
                        pours coffee and exits L. (Music.)
                    
                    PIKE
                        throws open window and looks out. Sounds of wheels on
                            cobble-stones without and crack of whip. Pause. PIKE
                        closes window and turns toward doors up C. with a sigh of
                            relief. The valet de  chambre (same dress
                            as Act I., but wearing plain black overcoat and square-topped black
                            derby) enters doors up C. from L., carrying a handsome carriage rug of
                            black fur on his arm. He touches electric button on wall near door;
                            bell, as he does so, is heard to ring off R. RIBIERE
                        comes quickly and noiselessly from upper door R. They stand
                            bowing at doors C. as VASILI
                        enters from L. through conservatory. Valet immediately closes
                            doors, and turns on light from button near door. VASILI
                        wears overcoat trimmed with sables, silk hat, evening clothes,
                            and white gloves; order ribbon in his buttonhole.

                        (as VASILI
                            enters).
                        I'm mighty glad you've comeI've been
                                    waiting(breaks off and steps back in
                                    surprise as lights go up.) Law me! You must have
                            been leading the grand march somewhere to-night.

                            and speaking in undertone).
                        You have telegraphed for the information?
                    
                    
                        RIBIERE.
                        Yes, sir. (Valet, with coat, hat, etc., exits by
                                    upper door R., followed by RIBIERE.)
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        VASILI
                        (continuing to PIKE).
                        I have dined with an old tutor of mine. Once every year I come here to do
                            that.
                    
                    
                        Valet immediately returns with tray on which are vodka and
                            cigarettes, places on table near fire and exits.
                    
                    
                        VASILI
                        (continuing, with brief, keen glance at PIKE).
                        And you, I suppose you dined with the charming young lady, your ward, and
                            her brother, as you expected. (He goes to fire and
                                    warms his hands.)
                        
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (turning away to C., sadly).
                        Oh, no, they've got' friends of their own here.
                    
                    
                        VASILI
                        (quietly).
                        So I have observed. (Sits by fire and sips
                                    vodka.)
                        
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (gently).
                        Oh, I don't mind their not asking me. (With
                                    assumption of cheerfulness.) Fact is, these friends
                            of hers are trying to get me to do something I can't do
                    
                    
                        VASILI.
                        You need not tell me that, my friend. I have both eyes and ears; I
                            understand.
                    
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (troubled, coming near him).
                        I wish you understood the rest, because it ain't easy for me to
                            tell you. Doc., I'm afraid I've got you into a pretty
                            bad hole.
                    
                    
                        VASILI
                        (smiling).
                        Ah, that, I fear I do not understand.
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (remorsefully).
                        I'm afraid I have. You and Ivanoff and meall three of us. This
                            Hawcastle knows, and he knows it as well as I know you're
                            settin' in that chair, that we've got that poor feller
                            in yonder (pointing down R.).
                    
                    
                        VASILI.
                        Surely you can trust Lord Hawcastle not to mention it. He must know that
                            the consequences for you, as well as for me, would be, to say the least,
                            disastrous. Surely you made that clear to him.
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (grimly).
                        No; he made it clear to me. Two years in jail is the minimum, and if I
                            don't make up my mind by ten o'clock (VASILI
                                looks at his watch) to do what he wants me
                            to do
                    
                    
                        VASILI.
                        What does he want you to do?
                    
                    
                    
                        PIKE.
                        The young lady's father trusted me to look after her, and if I

                        Well, if I don't consent to do that, I reckon Ivanoff has to go
                            back to Siberia, and you and I to jail.

                        What do you mean to do?

                        There wouldn't be any trouble about it if it was only me. That
                            would make it easy. They could  land me
                            for two years (swallowing painfully) or
                            twenty. What makes it so hard is that I can't do what they
                            want, even to let you and Ivanoff out (with serious
                                    emphasis). It ain't my money. All I can do
                            is to ask you to forgive me, and warn you to get away before they come
                            down on me. This feller's got me, Doc.
                            Don't you see how it stands? Ivanoff can't get

                        So can you; Ivanoff is the only one who can't go. You have not
                            thought of that?

                        That's part of the load off my mind. I can't bear to
                            think of the rest of it. I haven't known how to tell that poor

                                kindly tone).
                        Don't you want to sit closer to the fire?

                                remark).
                        My brother-in-law feels that someone well acquainted with Miss
                            Granger-Simpson's ambitions and her inner nature should put the
                            case finally to you before we proceed to extremities.

                        LADY C.
                        My brother-in-law has made us quite aware of the state of affairs, and we
                            are quite in sympathy with my brother-in-law's attitude as to
                            what should be done to you.

                        LADY C.
                        If, in the kindness of our hearts, we condone your  offence, we insist upon your accession to our reasonable
                            demands.

                        (sharply).
                        Quite so.
                    
                    
                        PIKE

                        LADY C.
                        It hasn't been thought proper. Young girls should be shielded
                            from everything disagreeable.

                        Yes, ma'am; that's the idea that got me into this

                        LADY C.
                        (continuing).
                        I say, this young lady who seems to be technically your ward is
                            considered, by all of us who understand her, infinitely more my ward.
                    
                    
                        PIKE.
                        Yes, ma'am! Go on.

                        She came to me something more than a year ago
                    
                    
                        PIKE

                        Did you advertise?
                    
                    
                        LADY C.
                        (stung).
                        I suppose it is your intention to be offensive.
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (protestingly, honestly).
                        No, ma'am; I didn't mean anything. But you see
                            I've handled all her accounts, and her payments to you
                    
                    
                        LADY C.
                        (cutting him off crushingly).
                        We will omit tradesman-like references! What Lord Hawcastle wished me to
                            impress on you is not only that you will ruin yourself, but put a blight
                            upon the life of the young lady whom you are pleased to consider your
                            ward. We make this suggestion because we conceive that you have a
                            preposterous sentimental interest yourself in Miss Granger-Simpson.
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (taken aback).
                        Me?
                    
                    
                    
                        LADY C.
                        Upon what other ground are we to explain your conduct?
                    
                    
                        PIKE.
                        You mean that I'd only stand between her and you for my own
                            sake?
                    
                    
                        LADY C.
                        We can comprehend no other grounds.
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (solemnly).
                        I don't believe you can! (Slight
                                pause.) But you can comprehend that I
                            wouldn't have any hope, can't you?
                    
                    
                        LADY C.
                        One never knows what these weird Americans hope. Hawcastle assures me you
                            have some such idea, but my charge has studied under my instruction
                            deportment, manners, and ideals, which have lifted her above the mere
                            American circumstance of her birth. She has ambitions. If you stand in
                            the way of them she will wither, she will die like a caged bird. All
                            that was sordid about her parentage, she has cast off. We have thought
                            that we might make something out of her.

                        Make something better of her. We offer her this
                            alliance with a family which for seven hundred years

                        LADY C.
                        With a family never sullied by those low ideals of barter and exchange
                            which are the governing impulses of your countrymen.

                        Jim Cooley, our Vice Consul in London. Jim ain't the wisest man

                        Well, I can call a person Colonel or Cap. or Doc. or anything of that
                            kind, but I just plain don't know how to use the kind of words
                            you have over here for those things. They don't seem to fit my
                            mouth somehow. Just let me run on my own way. I don't mean to
                            hurt your feelings. Anyway, Jim says your brother-in-law was in business
                            in Russia. (Up to this point he has gone on rapidly,
                                    but after the word " Russia " he pauses
                                    abruptly as if startled by a sudden thought and slowly
                                    repeats.) "In business in
                            Russia!" (He rises.)

                        PIKE
                        (leaning on back of his chair and looking at her
                                intently).
                        It is the point! Now, between us, ain't Jim right?
                            Ain't it the truth?

                        (angry and agitated).
                        Since some of your vulgar American officials have been spying about

                        Your brother-in-law was in business in Russiaso far, so good. (Leans upon back of chair watching her, eager, but
                                    smiling cordially.) I don't say he was
                            peddling shoestrings on the corner or selling weinerwursts

                        Probably something more hifalutin' and dignified than that. He
                            was probably agent for a wooden butter-dish factory.

                        Is your mind wandering? The priory belonged to Hawcastle's
                            mother. Can you state it's connection with the subject?
                    
                    
                        PIKE.
                        That's how he protected the historic name of St. Aubyn!
                            That's the name he tookGlenwood! (He speaks
                                    with great excitement, but appealing to her for
                                    confirmation.)

                        Lord Hawcastle, will you insist upon Ethel's leaving?
                            It's quite on the cards we shall have a disagreeable scene
                            here.

                        I see no occasion for it; we're here simply for Mr.
                            Pike's answer, which I believe will occasion something so
                            different from what you call a disagreeable scene that we might describe
                            it as a general rejoicing. (PIKE

                            eccentricities in which he chooses to veil himself, is a man of
                            extremely good sense. (significantly, as he turns
                                    toward PIKE.) He knows where we
                            stand and we know where he stands.

                            revolutionist who, in his crazy patriotism, took government money for
                            the cause he believed in. He made the mistake of keeping that money in
                            his house, when this man (pointing  his hand outstretched to
                                    HAWCASTLE) knew it was there. He also
                            made the mistake of having a wife that this man (still pointing to HAWCASTLE)
                            coveted and stoleas he coveted and stole the money. (with a denunciatory gesture at HAWCASTLE) Oh, he made a good job of it.
                            Don't think that to-night is the first time he has given
                            information to the police. He did it then, and the husband went to

                        More respectful, sir! You are addressing his highness, the Grand Duke

                        My friend, it has been refreshing. (To RIBIERE.) Ribiere, I shall take
                            Ivanoff's statement in writing. Bring him with you. (The valet crosses to door up R. quickly, holding it

                            bear his name. Now that you have shown me that it is a shame to bear it,
                            the promise is only more sacred. The shame is not his fault.

                            large table down R. has been removed, and only one tea-table stands down
                            L. Upon the steps leading to doors up L. is a pile of bags, hat-boxes,
                            and rugs. HAWCASTLE, in tweed
                            travelling suit and cap, is directing a porter who is adjusting a strap
                            on a travelling bag. ALMERIC, in
                            white flannels, Panama hat, carrying light stick, enters from double
                            doors up L., smoking cigarette. Leans carelessly against balustrade at
                            top of stoop.

                                    wary. Porter touches cap and exits into hotel.) It

                        Oh, but I say, Governor, you're not in a funk about him! You
                            could bowl him over with a finger.

                        The Grand Duke Vasili has the reputation of being a romantic fool. I

                            would be nearer it.
                    
                    
                    
                        HAW.
                        How?
                    
                    
                        LADY C.
                        Shedding tears over this Ivanoff's story. What's more
                            she has sent that dreadful Pike person to him with assistance.
                    
                    
                        HAW.
                        What sort of assistance?
                    
                    
                        LADY C.
                        Money; I don't know how much, but I'm sure it was a
                            lot.
                    
                    
                        ALMERIC
                        (With a sudden inspiration).
                        By Jove! Buying the beggar off, perhaps, to keep him from making a
                            scandal for us.
                    
                    
                        HAW
                        (excitedly).
                        By God! that's what she's trying to do!
                    
                    
                        LADY C.
                        Then why do you go?
                    
                    
                        HAW.
                        Because I'm not sure she can, (Going to
                                    steps.) Wire me at the Bertolini, Naples.
                                    (Turning' at stoop.)
                            This shows she means to stick.
                    
                    
                    
                        LADY C.
                        For the sake of her promise.
                    
                    
                        HAW
                        (emphatically).
                        Yes, and for the sake of the name. (Exit up L. very
                                    rapidly.)
                        
                    
                    PIKE
                        enters from R., stands near wings down R., looking after
                            HAWCASTLE. He wears same trousers as in
                            first act, with rather longish sack coat of same material; neat
                            waistcoat, hat same as in Act I. Is smoking cigar. ALMERIC
                        at C., looking after HAWCASTLE. LADY C.
                        same. Short pause.)
                    
                        PIKE
                        (slowly and thoughtfully).
                        Your pa seems in a hurry.
                    
                    LADY C. and ALMERIC
                        turn, startled. LADY C. haughtily sweeps up and exits up L.
                    
                    
                        ALMERIC
                        (cheerfully).
                        Oh, yes, possiblyhe's off, you knowto catch a train.
                            He's so easily worried by trifles. (As he
                                    speaks he saunters R. They cross each other. PIKE comes to chair by small table L. C., rests his elbows
                                    on table, as he sits, and looks at ALMKRIC with a soil of chuckling admiration.)
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (amiably).
                        Well, you don't worrynot too easy; do you, son?
                    
                    
                        ALMERIC
                        (coldly).
                        Oh, one finds nothing in particular this morning to bother one.
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (as If assenting).
                        Nothing at all.
                    
                    
                        ALMERIC.
                        Not I. Of course Miss Ethel is standing to her promise.
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (grimly, more to himself than to ALMERIC).
                        Yes, she is.
                    
                    
                        ALMERIC
                        (continuing).
                        The Governor only thought it best to clear out a bit until we were
                            certain that she manages to draw off this convict chap.
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (puzzled).
                        Draw him off?
                    
                    
                        ALMERIC.
                        What you Americans call " affixing him," isn't
                            it?
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (kindly).
                        "Affixing him?" Don't try to talk United
                            States, my son. Just tell me in your own way.
                    
                    
                    
                        ALMERIC.
                        She's been giving him money, hasn't she? You took it to
                            him yourself, didn't you? Naturally, we understood what it was
                            for. She's trying to keep the beggar quiet.
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (quietly).
                        So that's what she sent this poor cuss the money for, was
                            it?
                    
                    
                        ALMERIC.
                        Why, what other reason could there be?
                    
                    
                        PIKE.
                        Well, you know I sort of gathered it was because she was sorry for
                            himthought he'd been wronged; but, of course, I'm
                            stupid.
                    
                    
                        ALMERIC.
                        Well, ra-ther. I don't know that it was so
                            necessary for her to hush him up, but it showed a very worthy intention
                            in her, didn't?
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (slowly).
                        Would you mind my being present when you thank her for it?
                    
                    
                        ALMERIC.
                        Shouldn't in the least if I intended thanking her.  It simply shows she considers herself
                            already one of us. It's perfectly plainwhy it's plain
                            as you are. (Chuckles.)
                        
                    
                    
                        PIKE.
                        And that's why you're not worrying?
                    
                    
                        ALMERIC.
                        Worrying? My good man, do you mind excusing me. I saw a most likely pup
                            yesterday; I'm afraid some other chap'll snatch him up
                            before I do. I should have taken him at once. Good morning! (Exits R., with a sprightly gait and a wave of his
                                    stick.)
                        
                    
                    PIKE
                        sits gazing after him, shaking his head with half-admiring,
                            half-sardonic chuckle. Looks front, wipes his forehead, and stares again
                            after ALMERIC. Enter ETHEL
                        up L. She wears a pretty morning dress and hat; her face is
                            very sad.
                    
                    
                        ETHEL
                        (coming down L. C.).
                        I hear that Lord Hawcastle has left the hotel.
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (rising, resting one hand on back of chair, speaks
                                dryly).
                        Yes; I saw him go.
                    
                    
                    
                        ETHEL.
                        He left very quickly?
                    
                    
                        PIKE.
                        He did seem to be forgetting the scenery.
                    
                    
                        ETHEL
                        (decidedly).
                        He was afraid of Ivanoff.
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (dryly).
                        I shouldn't be surprised. (Turns up
                                C.)
                        
                    
                    
                        ETHEL.
                        Has Ivanoff followed him?
                    
                    
                        PIKE.
                        Not yet; I think he is looking for you.
                    
                    
                        ETHEL.
                        Why does he wish to see me? (Turns R.
                                C.)
                        
                    
                    MARIANO
                        enters up L.
                    
                    
                        MARIANO.
                        Monsieur Ivanoff, to say good-bye, if Mademoiselle permit.
                    
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (at steps).
                        That's all right, Mariano; Mademoiselle permits. (Exit MARIANO
                                up L. quickly, PIKE
                                goes up steps, turns, and looks across to ETHEL; she bows her head gravely in
                                    acquiescence; IVANOFF
                                enters up L., passing PIKE.)
                        
                    
                    
                        PIKE
                        (detaining him by placing hand on his shoulder, as the
                                latter reaches the step below him).
                        I'll say good-bye to you at your carriage outside, old man.
                            I'll see you off. (Exit up L. after IVANOFF has quickly pressed his
                                hand.)
                        
                    
                    
                        IVANOFF
                        (going down R. C., bows deeply to ETHEL. He wears same coat and trousers as in Act
                                III., white collar, cuffs, and black tie, plain Italian cloak and
                                black felt hat; clean shaven).
                        Dear, kind young lady, your guardian has known how to make me accept the
                            help you granted. He has known how because his heart is like yours, full
                            of goodness. I shall go to London and teach the languages. There I shall

                        My wife exists no longer for me. When I saw her last night so bitterly
                            afraid of me I only knew that I never wished to see her again.

                        No, no, no! I could not hurt his bodyI would not. The suffering of a man

                            world? It is that name of histhat proud name. Except for that, he is
                            poor, and that I shall destroy. I shall make his name a sounding for all
                            that is shameful and despised, and I shall do that in his own country,
                                 in England. He shall not go in his
                            club, he shall not go amongst his own class, and in the streets they
                            will point at him. His story and mine shall be madeAh, but too well
                            known! Do not think me helpless to do that. There are Russians in London
                            to-day who belong to my society, friends of mine not without influence,
                            not withfiut power; the world will know that each word I say is true,
                            and that name of which he and all his family have been so proud, it
                            shall be disgrace and dishonor to bear.

                            hand her over! (Turns with short bitter laugh, walks
                                    up stage, comes back.) By Jove! I
                            shouldn't be surprised if you consent to the settlement,
                            too!

                        Oh, I'm jest crossing the Rubicon. Your father used to have a
                            saying: "If you're going to cross the Rubicon, cross
                            it. Don't wade out to the middle and stand

                                enters from hotel.) Mariano, do you think
                            you could be trusted to wash him?tepid water, you know, and mind he
                            doesn't take cold, and just a little milk afterwardsnothing
                            else but milk, you understandyou. be deuced careful, I mean to say.

                            permitted the sacrifice was enough! Now you ask me to pay for the
