                            On our glittering track
                            In a shower of tremulous, murmuring swells
                            Of the echoing, airy, melodious bells!
                            O the mirth of the bells!
                            And the worth of the bells!
                            Come tinkle again, in this dearth of the bells,
                            This laughter and love that I lack, yearning back,
                            For the faraway sound of the bells!
                        
                        
                            Ah! the bells, they were glad in the long ago!
                            And the tinkles they had, they have thrilled me so
                            I have said: "It is they and her songs and
                                face
                            Make summer for me in the wintriest place!
                            And nowbut sobbings and sad farewells,
                            As I peer in the night through the sleeted
                                pane,
                            Hearing a clangor and wrangle of bells,
                            And never a tinkle again!
                            
                            The snow is a-swoon, and the moon dead white,
                            And the frost is wild in the air to-night!
                            Yet still will I linger and listen and pray
                            Till the sound of her voice shall come this
                                way,
                            With a tinkle of bells,
                            And the lisp-like tread
                            Of the hooves of the sleigh,
                            And the murmurs and swells
                            Of the vows she said.
                            And O, I shall listen as madmen may,
                            But the tinkling bells ring down this way!
                            Till again the grasp of my hand entwines
                            The tensioned loops of the quivering lines,
                            And again we ride in the wake of the pride
                            And the strength of the coursers, side by side;
                            With our faces smitten again by the spray
                            Of the froth of our steeds as we gallop away
                            In affright of the bells,
                            And the infinite glee and delight of the bells,
                            As they tinkle and tinkle and tinkle, till they
                            Are heard through a dawn where the mists are drawn,
                            And we canter and gallop and dash away
                            Sheer into the Judgment Day!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        HAS SHE FORGOTTEN.
                        
                            I.
                            HAS she forgotten? On this very May
                            We were to meet here with the birds and bees,
                            As on that Sabbath, underneath the trees
                            We strayed among the tombs, and stripped away
                            The vines from these old granites, cold and gray
                            And yet, indeed, not grim enough were they
                            To stay our kisses, smiles and ecstasies.
                            Has she forgottenthat the May has won
                            Its promise?and that the bird-songs from the
                                tree
                            Are sprayed above the grasses as the sun
                            Might jar the dazzling dew down showeringly?
                            Has she forgotten lifeloveeveryone
                            Has she forgotten meforgotten me?
                        
                        
                            II.
                            Low, low down in the violets I press
                            My lips and whisper to her. Does she hear,
                            And yet hold silence, though I call her dear
                            Just as of old, save for the tearfulness
                            Of the clenched eyes, and the soul's great distress?
                            
                            Has she forgotten thus the old caress
                            That made our breath a quickened atmosphere
                            That failed nigh unto swooning with the sheer
                            Delight! My arms clutch now this earthen heap
                            Sodden with tears that flow on ceaselessly,
                            As autumn rains the long, long, long nights weep
                            In memory of days that used to be
                            Has she forgotten these? And, in her sleep,
                            Has she forgotten meforgotten me?
                        
                        
                            III.
                            To-night, against my pillow, with shut eyes,
                            I mean to weld our facesthrough the dense
                            Incalculable darkness make pretense
                            That she has risen from her reveries
                            To mate her dreams with mine in marriages
                            Of mellow palms, smooth faces, and tense ease
                            Of every longing nerve of indolence,
                            Lift from the grave her quiet lips, and stun
                            My senses with her kissesdrawl the glee
                            Of her glad mouth, full blithe and tenderly,
                            Across mine own, forgetful if is done
                            The old-time intimacy when said we,
                            "To-day is ours!" * * * Ah, Heaven! can it be
                            She has forgotten meforgotten me?
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        IN DAYS TO COME.
                        
                            I.
                            IN days to come, when you and I
                            Wax faint and frail, and heartfires die,
                            And tinkling rhymes no more obey
                            The wooing lips of yesterday,
                            How slowly will the hours go by!
                            When we have drained our song cups dry,
                            My comrade, shall we sit and sigh,
                            Child-like, o'er joys too sweet to stay,
                            In days to come?
                        
                        
                            Nay! nay! we'll give old time the lie,
                            And, thatched with three-score years we'll try
                            A rondeau or a roundelay
                            As long as any lute string may
                            To our light touches make reply

                            THE air is chill;
                            The whippoorwill
                            Pipes mournfully behind the hill;
                            The dusk grows dense
                            The silence tense,

                            Through shadowy rifts,
                            Of woodland lifts,
                            The low, slow moon, and upward drifts;
                            And left and right
                            The fire-flies light
                            And trail their torches through the night.

                            And level lay
                            The mists across the face of Day;
                            At foot and head,
                            Above the dead,

                            That is not, as he knows, he sees her face
                            And, coming thus upon it, unaware,
                            Set moonwise in the midnight of her hair,
                            He can but think him of a glimmering June
                            Long lost, and his soul's lips do purl a tune
                            Remembered of his youth. The eyes of her
                            That show nor tears, nor laughter, nor surprise
                            Are dim with far-off gazings, and the blur
                            Of dreams drawn from the depths of deepest
                                skies,

                            You bring such curious things to me!
                            Laughs to the lipstears to the eye,
                            In looking on the gifts that lie
                            Like broken playthings scattered o'er
                            Imagination's nursery floor!
                            Did these old hands once click the key

                            And that blear-eyed, fur-whiskered elf
                            Leap, as though frightened at himself,
                            And quiveringly lean and stare
                            At me, his jailer, laughing there?

                            But uselessly I sit all day
                            Here by the chimney-jamb, and poke
                            The lazy fire, and smoke and smoke,
                            And watch the wreaths swoop up the flue,
                            And chuckle, as I often do,
                            Seeing again, all suddenly,
                            "Jack-in-the-box" leap up in glee,
                            
                            To see how much he looks like me.
                            They talk; I can't hear what they say
                            But I am glad clean through and through,
                            Sometimes, in fancying that they
                            Are saying, "Sweet! that fancy strays

                            The river seemed to shiver; and, far down
                            Its darkened length, I saw the sycamores
                            
                            Lean inward closer, under the vast frown
                            That weighed above the shores.
                        
                        
                            V.
                            There was a roar, born of some awful burst
                            And one lay, shrieking, chattering, in my path
                            Flunghe or Iout of some space accurst
                            As of Jehovah's wrath.

                            Ere back the noon flashed o'er the ruin done,
                            And, o'er uprooted forests, tousled there,
                            The birds sang in the sun.

                            Sence us fellers in bare feet
                            And straw hats went through the wheat,
                            Cuttin' crost the shortest shoot
                            Fer that-air old ellum-root
                            
                            Jest above the mill-dam, where
                            The blame' cars now crosses there!
                        
                        
                            Through the willers down the crick
                            We could see the old mill stick
                            Its red gable up, as if
                            It jest knowed we'd stol'd the skiff!
                            See the winders in the sun,
                            Blink like they was wonderun'
                            What the miller ort to do

                            But old Kingry!who could fear
                            That old chap, with all his cheer?
                            Leanin' at the winder-sill,
                            Er the half-door of the mill,
                            Swoppin' lies, and pokin' fun
                            'N-jigglin' like his hoppers done,
                            Laughin' grists o' gold and red
                            Right out o' the wagon-bed!
                        
                        
                            What did he keer where we went?
                            "Jest keep out o' devilment,
                            And don't fool round the belts,

                            Then we'd climb the stairs, and play
                            In the bran-bins half the day!
                        
                        
                        
                            Rickollect the dusty wall,
                            And the spider-webs and all!
                            Rickollect the trimblin' spout
                            Where the meal come josslin' out

                            The fool-truck an hour er two

                            Climb, high up above the stream,
                            And "coon" out the wobbly beam,
                            And peek down from out the lof'
                            Where the weatherboards was off

                            Even just to think of it!
                            Lookin' 'way down there below
                            On the worter roarin' so!
                        
                        
                            Rickollect the flume and wheel,
                            And the worter, slosh and reel,
                            And jest ravel out in froth
                            Flossier'n satin cloth!

                            Knock the bubbles galley-west,
                            And plunge under, and come up,
                            Drippin' like a worter-pup!
                        
                        
                            And, to see them old things gone
                            That I onc't was bettin' on,
                            
                            In rale pint o' fact, I feel
                            Kindo' like that worter-wheel,
                            Sorto' drippy-like and wet
                            Round the eyesbut paddlin' yet,
                            And, in mem'ry, loafin' still
                            Down around old Kingry's Mill!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        "THE PREACHER'S BOY."
                        
                            I RECKOLLECT the little tad, back, years and years ago
                            "The Preacher's Boy" that every one despised and hated so!
                            A meek-faced little feller, with white eyes and foxy hair,
                            And a look like he expected serious trouble everywhere;
                            A sort o' fixed expression of suspicion in his glance;
                            His bare feet always scratched with briars; and green spots on
                                his pants;
                            Molasses marks along his sleeves; his cap-rim turned behind
                            And so it is "The Preacher's Boy" is brought again to mind!
                        
                        
                            My fancy even brings the sly marauder back so plain,
                            I see him jump our garden fence and slip off down the
                                lane;
                            And I seem to holler at him and git back the old reply:
                            
                            "Oh, no! your peaches is too green 'for such a worm as I!'
                                "
                            For he scorned his father's phrasesevery holy one he had
                            "As good a man," folks put it, "as that boy of his was
                                bad!"
                            And again, from their old buggy shed, I hear "the rod
                                unspared"
                            That never "spoiled the child," of course, for which nobody
                                cared!
                        
                        
                            If any neighbor ever found his gate without a latch;
                            Or rines around the edges of his watermelon patch;
                            His pastur'-bars left open; or his pump-spout chocked with
                                clay,
                            He'd swear 'twas "that infernal preacher's boy," right
                                away!
                            When strings were stretched acrost the street at night, and
                                someone got
                            An everlastin' tumble, and his nose broke', like as not,
                            And laid it on "the preacher's boy" no powers, low nor
                                high,
                            Could ever quite substantiate that boy's alibi!
                        
                        
                        
                            And did nobody like the boy? Well, all the pets in town
                            Would eat out of his fingers; and canaries would come down
                            And leave their swingin' perches and their fishbone jist to
                                pick
                            The little warty knuckles that the dogs would leap to lick
                            No little snarlin', snappin' fiste but what would leave his
                                bone
                            To foller if he whistled in that tantalizin' tone
                            That made the goods-box whittler blasphemously protest
                            He couldn't tell, 'twixt dog and boy, which one was
                                ornriest!
                        
                        
                            'Twas such a little cur as this, once, when the crowd was
                                thick
                            Along the streets, a drunken corner-loafer tried to kick,
                            When a sudden foot behind him tripped him up, and, falling
                                so,
                            He "marked his man," and jerked his gundrawed up and let 'er
                                go!
                            And the crowd swarmed round the victimholding close against
                                his breast
                            The little dog, unharmed, in arms that still as they
                                caressed
                            
                            Grew rigid in their last embrace, as with a smile of joy
                            He recognized the dog was saved. So died "The Preacher's
                                Boy!"
                        
                        
                            When it appeared, before the 'Squire, that fatal
                                pistol-ball
                            Was fired at "a dangerous beast," and not the boy at all,
                            And the facts set forth established, it was like-befittin'
                                then
                            To order out a possy of the "city councilmen"
                            To kill the dog! But, strange to tell, they searched the
                                country round,
                            And never hide nor hair of that "said" dog was found!
                            And, somehow, then I sort o' thoughtand half way think
                                to-day
                            The spirit of "The Preacher's Boy" had whistled him away.

                            Sing a song of cheer!
                            Here's a holiday, boys,

                            Round the world, and half is
                            Shadow we have tried;
                            Now we're where the laugh is,
                            On the sunny side!
                        
                        
                            Pigeons coo and mutter,
                            Strutting high aloof
                            Where the sunbeams flutter
                            Through the stable roof.
                            Hear the chickens cheep, boys,
                            And the hen with pride
                            Clucking them to sleep, boys,
                            On the sunny side!

                            Hear the cattle moo;
                            Hear the horses whinny,
                            Looking out at you!

                            Blossoms over each tree
                            In the orchards there!

                            Just ourselves or none, boys,

                            Laughing in the sun, boys,
                            On the sunny side!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WE TO SIGH INSTEAD OF SING!
                        
                            "RAIN and rain! and rain and rain!"
                            Yesterday we muttered
                            Grimly, as the grim refrain
                            That the thunders uttered.
                            All the heavens under cloud
                            All the sunshine sleeping;
                            All the grasses limply bowed
                            With their weight of weeping.
                        
                        
                            Sigh and sigh! and sigh and sigh!
                            Never end of sighing;
                            Rain and rain for our reply
                            Hopes half-drowned and dying;
                            Peering through the window pane,
                            Naught but endless raining-
                            Endless sighing, and, as vain,
                            Endlessly complaining.
                        
                        
                            Shine! and shine! and shine! and shine!
                            Ah! to-day, the splendor!
                            All this glory yours and mine
                            God! but God is tender!
                            
                            We to sigh instead of sing
                            Yesterday, in sorrow,
                            While the Lord was fashioning
                            This for us to-morrow!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE BEAUTIFUL CITY.
                        
                            THE Beautiful City! Forever
                            Its rapturous praises resound,
                            And we fain would behold itbut never
                            A glimpse of its glory is found.
                            We slacken our lips at the tender
                            White breasts of our mothers to hear
                            Of its marvelous beauty and splendor;
                            We seebut the gleam of a tear!
                        
                        
                            Yet never the story may tire us
                            First graven in symbols of stone
                            Rewritten on scrolls of papyrus,
                            And parchment, and scattered and blown
                            By the winds of the tongues of all nations,
                            Like a litter of leaves wildly whirled
                            Down the rack of a hundred translations,
                            From the earliest lisp of the world.
                        
                        
                            We compass the earth and the ocean,
                            From the Orient's uttermost light,
                            To where the last ripple in motion
                            Lips hem of the skirt of the night,
                            But the Beautiful City evades us
                            No spire of it glints in the sun
                            
                            No glad-bannered battlement shades us
                            When all our long journey is done.
                        
                        
                            Where lies it? We question and listen;
                            We lean from the mountain, or mast,
                            And see but dull earth, or the glisten
                            Of seas inconceivably vast:
                            The dust of the one blurs our vision
                            The glare of the other our brain,
                            Nor city nor island elysian
                            n all of the land or the main!
                        
                        
                            We kneel in dim fanes where the thunders
                            Of organs tumultuous roll,
                            And the longing heart listens and wonders,
                            And the eyes look aloft from the soul,
                            But the chanson grows fainter and fainter,
                            Swoons wholly away and is dead;
                            And our eyes only reach where the painter
                            Has dabbled a saint overhead.
                        
                        
                            The Beautiful City! O mortal,
                            Fare hopefully on in thy quest,
                            Pass down through the green grassy portal
                            That leads to the valley of rest.
                            There first passed the One who, in pity
                            Of all thy great yearning, awaits
                            To point out the Beautiful City,
                            And loosen the trump at the gates.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE KIND OLD MAN.
                        
                            THE kind old manthe mild old man
                            Who smiled on the boys at play,
                            Dreaming, perchance, of his own glad youth,
                            When he was as blithe and gay!
                        
                        
                            And the larger urchin tossed the ball,
                            And the lesser held the bat
                            Though the kindly old man's eyes were blurred,
                            He could even notice that!
                        
                        
                            But suddenly he was shocked to hear
                            Words that I dare not write,
                            And he hastened, in his kindly way,
                            To curb them as he might!
                        
                        
                            And he said"Tut! tut! you naughty boy
                            With the ball! for shame!" and then,
                            "You boy with the bat, whack him over the head
                            If he calls you that again!"
                        
                        
                            The kind old manthe mild old man
                            Who gazed at the boys at play,
                            Dreaming, perchance, of his own wild youth,
                            When he was as tough as they!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A VISION OF SUMMER.
                        
                            'TWAS a marvelous vision of Summer,
                            That morning the dawn was late,
                            And came, like a long dream-ridden guest,
                            Through the gold of the Eastern gate.
                        
                        
                            Languid it came, and halting,
                            As one that yawned, half roused,
                            With lifted arms and indolent lids,
                            And eyes that drowsed and drowsed.
                        
                        
                            A glimmering haze hung over
                            The face of the smiling air;
                            And the green of the trees, and the blue of the leas
                            And the skies gleamed everywhere.
                        
                        
                            Emeralds of dew on the grasses;
                            The rose with rubies set;
                            On the lily, diamonds; and amethysts
                            Pale on the violet.
                        
                        
                            There were the pinks of the fuchsias,
                            And the peony's crimson hue,
                            The lavender of the hollyhocks,
                            And the morning-glory's blue:
                        
                        
                        
                            The pallor of the pansy bloom,
                            And the passionate flush of the face
                            Of the velvet-rose; and the thick perfume
                            Of the locust every place.
                        
                        
                            And the air and the sun and the shadows
                            Were wedded and made as one;
                            And the winds ran over the meadows
                            As little children run:
                        
                        
                            And the winds poured over the meadows,
                            And along the willowy way
                            The river ran, with its ripples shod
                            With the sunshine of the day,
                        
                        
                            O, the winds flowed over the meadows
                            In a tide of eddies and calms,
                            And the bared brow felt the touch of it
                            As a sweetheart's tender palms.
                        
                        
                            And the lark went palpitating
                            Up through the glorious skies,
                            His song spilled down from the blue profound
                            As a song from Paradise.
                        
                        
                            And here was the loitering current
                            Stayed by a drift of sedge
                            And sodden logs scummed thick with the gold
                            Of the pollen from edge to edge.
                        
                        
                        
                            The catbird piped in the hazel,
                            And the harsh kingfisher screamed,
                            And the crane, in amber and oozy swirls
                            Dozed in the reeds and dreamed.
                        
                        
                            And in through the tumbled driftage,
                            And the tangled roots below,
                            The waters warbled and gurgled and lisped
                            Like the lips of long ago.
                        
                        
                            And the senses caught, through the music,
                            Twinkles of dabbling feet,
                            And glimpses of faces in coverts green,
                            And voices faint and sweet.
                        
                        
                            And back from the lands enchanted
                            Where my earliest mirth was born,
                            The trill of a laugh was blown to me
                            Like the blare of an elfin horn.
                        
                        
                            Again I romped through the clover,
                            And again I lay supine
                            On grassy swards, where the skies, like eyes,
                            Look lovingly back in mine.
                        
                        
                            And anon o'er my vision floated
                            Misty illusive things,
                            Trailing strands of the gossamer
                            On heavenward wanderings.
                        
                        
                        
                            Figures that veered and wavered,
                            Luring the sight, and then,
                            Glancing away into nothingness,
                            And blinked into shape again.
                        
                        
                            From out far depths of the forest,
                            Ineffably sad and lorn,
                            Like the yearning cry of a long-lost love,
                            The moan of the dove was borne.
                        
                        
                            And through the lush glooms of the thicket
                            The flash of the redbird's wings
                            On branches of star-white blooms that shook
                            And thrilled with his twitterings.
                        
                        
                            Through mossy and viney vistas,
                            Soaked ever with deepest shade,
                            Dimly the dull owl stared and stared
                            From his bosky ambuscade.
                        
                        
                            And up through the rifted treetops,
                            That signaled the wayward breeze,
                            I saw the hulk of the hawk becalmed
                            Far out on the azure seas.
                        
                        
                            Then sudden an awe fell on me,
                            As the hush of the golden day
                            Rounded to noon, as a May to June,
                            That a lover has dreamed away.
                        
                        
                        
                            And I heard, in the breathless silence,
                            And the full glad light of the sun,
                            The tinkle and drip of a timorous shower
                            Ceasing as it begun.
                        
                        
                            And my thoughts, like the leaves and grasses,
                            In a rapture of joy and pain,
                            Seemed fondled and petted and beat upon
                            With a tremulous patter of rain.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        BACK FROM A TWO YEARS' SENTENCE.
                        
                            BACK from a two years' sentence!
                            And though it had been ten,
                            You think, I were scarred no deeper,
                            In the eyes of my fellowmen.
                            "My fellow-men?"sounds like a satire,
                            You thinkand I so allow,
                            Here, in my home since childhood
                            Yet more than a stranger now!
                        
                        
                            Pardon! Not wholly a stranger,
                            For I have a wife and child:
                            That woman has wept for two long years,
                            And yet last night she smiled!
                            Smiled, as I leapt from the platform
                            Of the midnight train, and then
                            All that I know was that smile of hers,
                            And our babe in my arms again!
                        
                        
                            Back from a two-years' sentence
                            But I have thought the whole thing through
                            A hint of it came when the bars swung back
                            And I looked straight up in the blue
                            
                            Of the blessed skies with my hat off!
                            O-ho! I've a wife and child:
                            That woman has wept for two long years,
                            And yet last night she smiled!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE WIFE.

                            Lorn-faced and long of hair

                            A sister of the air
                            Could clasp her not, but felt the stir
                            Of pinions everywhere.

                            And tranced him sirenwise;
                            And he did paint her, through a haze
                            Of sullen paradise,
                            With scars of kisses on her face
                            And embers in her eyes.

                            Through tears he paints her, as is meet,
                            Tracing the dear face o'er
                            With lilied patience meek and sweet

                        Obit. July 27, 1887, Kansas City, Mo.
                        
                            GIFTED, and loved and praised
                            By every friend;
                            Never a murmur raised
                            Against him, to the end!
                            With tireless interest
                            He wrought as he thought best,
                            Andlo, we bend

                            His heart was loyal, to
                            Its latest thrill,
                            To the home-loves he knew
                            And now forever will,
                            Mother and brotherthey
                            The first to pass away,
                            And, lingering still,
                            The sisters bowed to-day.
                        
                        
                            Pure as a rose might be,
                            And sweet and white,
                            His father's memory
                            Was with him day and night:
                            He spoke of him, as one
                            May now speak of the son,
                            
                            Sadly and tenderly,
                            Yet as a trump had done.
                        
                        
                            Say, then, of him: He knew
                            Full depths of care
                            And stress of pain, and you
                            Do him scant justice there,
                            Yet in the lifted face
                            Grief left not any trace,
                            Nor mark unfair,
                            To mar its manly grace.
                        
                        
                            It was as if each day
                            Some new hope dawned
                            Each blessing in delay,
                            To him, was just beyond;
                            Between whiles, waiting, he
                            Drew pictures cunningly

                            Things that we laughed to see.
                        
                        
                            Sometimes, as we looked on
                            His crayon's work,
                            Some angel-face would dawn
                            Out, radiant, from the mirk
                            Of features old and thin,
                            Or jowled with double-chin,
                            And eyes a-smirk,
                            And gaping mouths a-grin.
                        
                        
                        
                            That humor in his art,
                            Of genius born,
                            Welled warmly from a heart
                            That could not but adorn
                            All things it touched with love
                            The eagle, as the dove
                            The burst of morn
                            The nightthe stars above.
                        
                        
                            Sometimes, amid the wild
                            Of faces queer,
                            A mother, with her child
                            Pressed warm and close to her;
                            This, I have thought, somehow,
                            The wife, with head a-bow,
                            Unreconciled,
                            In the great shadow now.
                        
                        
                            O ye of sobbing breath,
                            Put by all sighs
                            Of anguish at his death
                            Turnas he turned his eyes,
                            In that last hour, unknown,
                            In strange lands, all alone
                            Turn toward the skies,
                            And, smiling, cease thy moan.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        HER HAIR.
                        
                            THE beauty of her hair bewilders me
                            Pouring adown the brow, its cloven tide
                            Swirling about the ears on either side
                            And storming round the neck tumultuously:
                            Or like the lights of old antiquity
                            From mullioned windows, in cathedrals wide,
                            Spilled Moltenly o'er figures deified
                            In chastest marble, nude of drapery.
                            And so I love it. Either unconfined,
                            Or plaited in close braidings manifold;
                            Or smoothly drawn, or indolently twined
                            In careless knots whose coilings come unrolled
                            At any lightest kiss; or by the wind
                            Whipped out in flossy ravellings of gold.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        "OUT TO OLD AUNT MARY'S."
                        
                            WASN'T it pleasant, O, brother mine,
                            In those old days of the lost sunshine
                            Of youthwhen the Saturday's chores were through,
                            And the "Sunday's wood" in the kitchen, too,
                            And we went visiting, "Me and you,
                            Out to old Aunt Mary's!"
                        
                        
                            It all comes back so clear to-day!
                            Though I am as bald as you are gray
                            Out by the barn-lot and down the lane,
                            We patter along in the dust again,
                            As light as the tips of the drops of the rain,
                            Out to old Aunt Mary's.
                        
                        
                            We cross the pasture, and through the wood
                            Where the old gray snag of the poplar stood,
                            Where the hammering "red-heads" hopped away,
                            And the buzzard raised in the open sky
                            And lolled and circled as we went by
                            Out to old Aunt Mary's.
                        
                        
                        
                            And then in the dust of the road again;
                            And the teams we met, and the country-men;
                            And the long highway with the sunshine spread
                            As thick as butter on country bread,
                            And our cares behind, and our hearts ahead,
                            Out to old Aunt Mary's.
                        
                        
                            I see her now in the open-door
                            Where the little gourds grew up the sides, and o'er
                            The clapboard roof.And her faceoh, me!
                            Wasn't it good for a boy to see?
                            And wasn't it good for a boy to be
                            Out to old Aunt Mary's!
                        
                        
                            And O, my brother, so far away,
                            This is to tell you she waits to-day
                            To welcome us. Aunt Mary fell
                            Asleep this morning, whispering, "Tell
                            The boys to come!" And all is well!
                            Out to old Aunt Mary's.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        PAP'S OLD SAYIN'.
                        
                            PAP he used to have a sayin'
                            That I'll never quite fergit
                            And they're seven growed-up childern
                            Of us recollects it yit!
                            Settin' round the dinner table,
                            Gossippin' of friends, perhaps,
                            Er abusin' of our neighbors,
                            I kin hear them words of Pap's
                            "Shet up, and eat your vittals!"
                        
                        
                            Pap h'd never argy with us,
                            Ner cut any subject short
                            While we all kep' shet of jawin',
                            And was actin' as we ort;
                            But ef we'd git out of order
                            Like, sometimes, a family is
                            Faultin' folks, er one another,
                            Then you'd hear that voice of his:
                            "Shet up, and eat your vittals!"
                        
                        
                            Was no hand hisself at talkin'
                            Never hadn't much to say
                            Only, as I said, pervidin'
                            When we'd rile him thataway;
                            
                            Then he'd allus lose his temper
                            'Spite of fate, and jerk his head,
                            And slam down his caseknife vicious',
                            While he grit his teeth and said:
                            "Shet up, and eat your vittals!"
                        
                        
                            Mind last time when Pap was ailin'
                            With a misery in his side,
                            And that hobbled in the kitchen
                            Jest the very day he died;
                            Laury Jane she ups and tells him
                            "Pap, you're pale as pale kin be
                            Haint you 'feard them there cowcumbers
                            Haint good fer you?" And says he,
                            "Shet up, and eat your vittals."
                        
                        
                            Well! I've saw a-many-sorrow,
                            Forty year, through thick and thin;
                            I've "got there," and I've got "tuckered'
                            Time and time and time agin!
                            But I've met a-many trouble
                            That I hain't run onto twice,
                            When I'd turn to overhaulin'
                            Them there words of Pap's advice:
                            "Shet up, and eat your vittals!"
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE.
                        
                            AS THE little white hearse went glimmering
                                by
                            The man on the coal-cart jerked his lines,
                            And smutted the lid of either eye,
                            And turned and stared at the business signs;
                            And the street-car driver stopped and beat
                            His hands on his shoulders, and gazed up street
                            Till his eye on the long track reached the sky
                            As the little white hearse went glimmering by.
                        
                        
                            As the little white hearse went glimmering by
                            A stranger petted a ragged child
                            In the crowded walk, and she knew not why,
                            But he gave her a coin for the way she smiled;
                            And a bootblack thrilled with a pleasure
                                strange
                            As a customer put back his change
                            With a kindly hand and a grateful sigh
                            As the little white hearse went glimmering by.
                        
                        
                        
                            As the little white hearse went glimmering by
                            A man looked out of a window dim,
                            And his cheeks were wet and his heart was dry
                            For a dead child even were dear to him!
                            And he thought of his empty life and said:
                            "Loveless alive, and loveless dead
                            Nor wife nor child in earth or sky!"
                            As the little white hearse went glimmering by.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        ALL ALONE.
                        
                            
                                How all alone
                                A man may be in crowds.
                                JOAQUIN MILLER.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            HE sat in a seat in the smoking-car
                            A double seat which he occupied
                            Himself and his legs on either side
                            Smoking a very black cigar
                            With the air of a man who had paid his way
                            From Genesis to Judgment Day.
                        
                        
                            The collar he wore was loose at the throat,
                            And a ragged tie scarce held it to;
                            And which was the dirtiest no one knew,
                            His shirt, his face, or his overcoat
                            And yet, that man, with the cheap cigar,
                            We envied there in the smoking-car.
                        
                        
                            Envied him? Yesfor the tranquil smile,
                            Diluting the grime on his swathy face,
                            And the rude plebeian force and grace
                            Of the sweep of his eye o'er the crowded aisle?
                            Nay, not for thesebut that rank cigar
                            That gave him room in the crowded car.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WHEN AGE COMES ON.
                        
                            I.
                            When age comes on:
                            The deepening dusk is where the dawn
                            Once glittered splendid, and the dew
                            In honey-drips from red rose-lips
                            Was kissed away by me and you.
                            And now across the frosty lawn
                            Black footprints trail, and Age comes on
                            And Age comes on
                            And biting wild-winds whistle through
                            Our tattered hopesand Age comes on!
                        
                        
                            I.
                            When Age comes on!
                            O tide of raptures, long withdrawn,
                            Flow back in summer-floods, and fling
                            Here at our feet our childhood sweet,
                            And all the songs we used to sing,
                            Old loves, old friendsall dead and gone
                            Our old faith lostand Age comes on
                            And age comes on!
                            Poor hearts! have we not anything
                            But longings left when Age comes on?
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A SONG OF LONG AGO.
                        
                            A SONG of long ago,
                            Sing it lightlysing it low
                            Sing it softlylike the lisping of the lips we used to know
                            When our baby-laughter spilled
                            From the hearts forever filled
                            With a music sweet as robin ever trilled!
                        
                        
                            Let the fragrant summer breeze,
                            And the leaves of the locust-trees,
                            And the apple-buds and blossoms, and the wings of
                                honey-bees
                            All palpitate with glee,
                            Till the happy harmony
                            Brings back each childish joy to you and me.
                        
                        
                            Let the eyes of fancy turn
                            Where the tumbled pippins burn
                            Like embers in the orchard's lap of touslea grass and
                                fern;
                            And let the wayward wind,
                            Still singing, plod behind
                            The cider-pressthe good old-fashioned kind!
                        
                        
                        
                            Blend in the song the moan
                            Of the dove that grieves alone,
                            And the wild whirr of the locust, and the bumble's drowsy
                                drone;
                            And the low of the cows that call
                            Through the pasture bars when all
                            The landscape faints away at evenfall.
                        
                        
                            Then, far away and clear,
                            Through the dusky atmosphere,
                            Let the wailing of the kildee be the only sound you hear.
                            O sweet and sad and low
                            As the memory may know
                            Is the glad-pathetic song of Long Ago!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THAT NIGHT.
                        
                            YOU and I, and that night, with its perfume
                                and glory!
                            The scent of the locuststhe light of the moon;
                            And the violin weaving the waltzers a story,
                            Enmeshing their feet in the weft of the tune,
                            Till their shadows uncertain
                            Reeled round on the curtain,
                            While under the trellis we drank in the June.
                        
                        
                            Soaked through with the midnight the cedars were sleeping,
                            Their shadowy tresses outlined in the bright
                            Crystal, moon-smitten mists, where the fountain's heart,
                                leaping
                            Forever, forever burst, full with delight;
                            And its lisp on my spirit
                            Fell faint as that near it
                            Whose love like a lily bloomed out in the night.
                        
                        
                            O your glove was an odorous sachet of blisses!
                            The breath of your fan was a breeze from
                                Cathay!
                            
                            And the roses at your throat was a nest of spilled kisses!
                            And the music!in fancy I hear it to-day,
                            As I sit here, confessing
                            Our secret and blessing
                            My rival who found us, and waltzed you away.

                            Turn the pockets inside out;
                            See, his penknife, lost to use,
                            Rusted shut with apple-juice;
                            Here with marbles, top and string,
                            Is his deadly "devil-sling,"
                            With its rubber, limp at last
                            As the sparrows of the past!

                            Bullets and a box of caps,
                            Not a thing of all, I guess,
                            But betrays some waywardness
                            E'en these tickets, blue and red,
                            For the Bible-verses said
                            Such as these his mem'ry kept
                            "Jesus wept."
                        
                        
                            Here a fishing hook and line,
                            Tangled up with wire and twine,
                            And dead angle-worms, and some
                            Slugs of lead and chewing gum,
                            Blent with scents that can but come
                            From the oil of rhodium.
                            Herea soiled, yet dainty note,
                            
                            That some little sweetheart wrote,
                            Dotting" Vine grows round the stump,"
                            And "My sweetest sugar lump!"
                            Wrapped in thisa padlock key
                            Where's he filed a touch-holesee!
                            And some powder in a quill
                            Corked up with a liver pill;
                            And a spongy little chunk
                            Of "punk"

                            Don't you hear us calling, dear?
                            Back! Come back, and never fear!
                            You may wander where you will, Over orchard, field and
                                hill;
                            You may kill the birds, or do
                            Anything that pleases you!
                            Ah, this empty coat of his!
                            Every tatter worth a kiss!
                            Every stain as pure instead
                            As the white stars overhead;
                            And the pocketshomes were they
                            Of the little hands that play

                            Beckon us.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        AT MADAME MANICURE'S
                        
                            DAINTIEST of Manicures!
                            What a cunning hand is yours;
                            And how awkward, rude and great
                            Mine, as you manipulate!
                            Wonderfully cool and calm
                            Are the touches of your palm
                            To my fingers as they rest
                            In their rosy, cozy nest,
                            While your own, with deftest skill,
                            Dance and caper as they will,
                            Armed with instruments that seem
                            Gathered from some fairy dream
                            Tiny spears and scimiters
                            Such as pixy armorers
                            Might have made for jocund fays
                            To parade on holidays,
                            And flash round in dewy dells,
                            Lopping down the lily-bells;
                            Or in tilting o'er the leas,
                            At the clumsy bumble-bees,
                            Splintering their stings, perchance,
                            As the knights in old romance
                            Snapped the spears of foes that fought
                            In the jousts at Camelot!
                            
                            Smiling? Dainty Manicure?
                            'Twould delight me, but that you're
                            Simply smiling, as I see,
                            At my nails, and not at me!
                            Haply this is why they glow
                            And light up and twinkle so!
                            I have read your secret!now
                            I divine the why and how
                            Of the sorcery that thus
                            Gems my fingers glorious!
                            It is not the tepid bath
                            Not the crescent blade and swath
                            Not the frankincense and myrrh
                            And the spikenard, as it were
                            (Not to name the "rosaline"
                            And "enamel" that I mean)
                            Not the "polishers" and files
                            Not the powder,but the smiles.
                            Ah! that matchless art of yours,
                            Daintiest of Manicures!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        LINCOLN.
                        
                            A QUIET lifejust simple things,
                            Was his desire,
                            To read of presidents and kings
                            Beside the cabin fire.
                            That was enough:to peer sometimes
                            Above the page, in dimmest gleams
                            Of amber light, and hear the rhymes
                            That came to him in dreams.
                        
                        
                            A quiet life,to hear the low
                            Of pastured herds,
                            Or woodman's ax, that blow on blow
                            Fell sweet as rhythmic words;
                            And yet there stirred within his breast
                            A fateful pulse that, like a roll
                            Of drums, made high above his rest
                            A tumult in his soul.
                        
                        
                            A quiet life! They hailed him even
                            As One was hailed
                            Whose open palms were nailed toward heaven
                            When prayers nor aught availed;
                            And, lo, the self-same price he paid
                            To lull a nation's awful strife,
                            And will us through a new decade
                            The peace of his quiet life.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE DEAD WIFE.
                        
                            I looked from the window. The smoke goes straight,
                            From the chimney, and there is a dust of snow;
                            And the weather is keen as the edge of fate.
                            And she was a girl in the long ago!
                        
                        
                            And I think of the laughing child she was
                            With nothing to hint of the old perfume
                            Of locust-blossomsyet something does
                            Is it the camphor in the room?
                        
                        
                            Christ Almighty, give me the past,
                            And let me be with things that were;
                            Or give me the hope of a glimpse at last
                            Of the living, laughing face of her!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WHEN BESSIE DIED.
                        
                            
                                If from your own the dimpled hands had slipped
                                And ne'er would nestle in your hand again;
                                If the white feet into the grave had tripped
                            
                        
                        
                            WHEN Bessie died
                            We braided the brown hair, and tied
                            It just as her own little hands
                            Had fastened back the silken strands
                            A thousand timesthe crimson bit
                            Of ribbon woven into it
                            That she had worn with childish pride
                            Smoothed down the dainty bow; and cried
                            When Bessie died.
                        
                        
                            When Bessie died
                            We drew the nursery blinds aside,
                            And as the morning in the room
                            Burst like a primrose into bloom,
                            Her pet canary's cage we hung
                            Where she might hear him when he sung
                            And yet not any note he tried,
                            Though she lay listening folded-eyed!
                        
                        
                            When Bessie died
                            We writhed in prayer unsatisfied;
                            
                            We begged of God, and He did smile
                            In silence on us all the while;
                            And we did see Him, through our tears,
                            Enfolding that fair form of her's,
                            She laughing back against His love
                            The kisses we had nothing of,
                            And death to us He still denied
                            When Bessie died
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        FROM DELPHI TO CAMDEN.
                        
                            I.
                            FROM Delphi to Camdenlittle Hoosier
                                towns,
                            But here were classic meadows, blooming dales and downs;
                            And here were grassy pastures, dewy as the leas
                            Trampled over by the trains of royal pageantries!
                        
                        
                            And here the winding highway loitered through the shade
                            Of the hazel-covert, where, in ambuscade,
                            Loomed the larch and linden, and the green wood-tree
                            Under which bold Robin Hood loud hallooed to me!
                        
                        
                            Here the stir and riot of the busy day
                            Dwindled to the quiet of the breath of May;
                            Gurgling brooks, and ridges, lily-marged, and spanned
                            By the rustic bridges found in Wonderland!
                        
                        
                            II.
                            From Delphi to Camdenfrom Camden back again!
                            
                            And now the night was on us, and the lightning and the
                                rain;
                            And still the way was wondrous with the flash of hill and
                                plain,
                            The stars, like printed asterisksthe moon a murky stain!
                        
                        
                            And I thought of tragic idyl, and of flight and hot
                                pursuit,
                            And the jingle of the bridle, and cuirass, and spur on
                                boot,
                            As our horses' hooves struck showers from the flinty bowlders
                                set
                            In freshet-way with writhing reed and drowning violet.
                        
                        
                            And we passed beleaguered castles, with their battlements
                                a-frown,
                            Where a tree fell in the forest was a turret toppled down;
                            While my master and commanderthe brave knight I galloped
                                with
                            On this reckless road to ruin, or to fame, was
                            Dr. Smith!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        IN STATE.
                        
                            IS IT the martins or
                                katydids?
                            Early morning or late at night?
                            A dream, perhaps, kneeling down on the lids
                            Of a dying man's eyesight.
                        
                        
                            Over and over I heard the rain
                            Over and over I waked to see
                            The blaze of the lamp as again and again
                            Its stare insulted me.
                        
                        
                            Time is so long when a man is dead!
                            Some one sews; and the room is made
                            Very clean; and the light is shed
                            Soft through the window-shade.
                        
                        
                            Yesterday I thought: "I know
                            Just how the bells will sound, and how
                            Friends will talk, and the sermon go,
                            And the hearse-horse bow and bow!"
                        
                        
                            This is to-day: and I have no thing

                            But to hear the throb of the pulse of a wing
                            That wants to fly back to you.

                            O THE blossoms, white and blue,
                            Purple, pink, and every hue,
                            From the sunny skies to tintings drowned
                            In dusky drops of dew!
                            O ye blossoms on the trees,
                            With your breath upon the breeze,
                            There's nothing all the world around
                            As half as sweet as you!
                        
                        
                            Could the rhymer only wring
                            All the sweetness to the lees
                            Of all the kisses clustering
                            In juicy use-to-be's,
                            He would dip his rhymes and sing
                            Of the blossoms on the trees!
                        
                        
                            "O ye blossoms on the trees,"
                            He would twitter, trill and coo,
                            And singing say"Such songs as these
                            Are not as sweet as you,
                            For you are blooming melodies
                            The eyes may listen to!"

                                times
                            When bards made money, and bankers rhymes;
                            And drones made honey, and bees made naught;
                            And the bad sung hymns, and the good folk fought;
                            And the merchants lurked in the shade all day
                            And pitched horse-shoes in a listless way:
                            When the ticket-man at the depot knew
                            If your trunk would go if you checked it through,
                            And if 2:30 meant half-past two,
                            And in-the-name-of-the-land to do
                            If a man got left when he oughtn't to;
                            When the hackman wept as he took your fare,
                            And the street-car driver led in prayer
                            And the kuss with the dyed mustache was there
                            That rode in town on a "jumper" sled,
                            And got whipped twice for the things he said
                            To fellows that told him his hair was red.
                            And the strange young man of which and whom
                            Our pencil offers to deign presume
                            To treat of now, in the days like these
                            When young men dress as they please to please;
                            Round in a coat of pale pink-blue,
                            
                            And a snow-white vest of a crimson hue,
                            And trousers purple, and gaiters gray
                            All cut, as the French or the Dutch would say,
                            La-macht nichts aus, oder-decollete,
                            Strange not only in dress, but in
                            The dimples he wore in cheek and chin
                            All nailed over with scraps of tin;
                            And his crape cravat, and the shape of that,
                            And the ear-tab over his diamond pin.
                            And his friends all wondered, and used to say,
                            "What a strange young man! Ah me! Hooray,
                            How sad he seems in his wild delight!
                            And how tickled indeed when he weeps outright!
                            What a comical man when he writhes in pain!
                            And how grieved he grows when he's glad again!"
                            And, marvelling still to remark new facts,
                            They said, "How slender and slim he acts!
                            And isn't it odd for a man to wear
                            A thumb-stall on his nose, and pare
                            His finger-nails with a carving-knife,
                            And talk of prunes to the landlord's wife?
                            It is patent to usand, indeed, no doubt,
                            Though as safely sealed as an oyster can,
                            Our interest in him must needs leak out,
                            Namelythat he is a strange young man!"

                            The shadow of the open door,
                        
                        
                        
                            And dancing dust and sunshine blent
                            Slanting the way the morning went,
                        
                        
                            And beckoning my thoughts afar
                            Where reeds and running waters are;
                        
                        
                            Where amber-colored bayous glass
                            The half-drowned weeds and wisps of grass;
                        
                        
                            Where sprawling frogs, in loveless key,
                            Sing on and on incessantly.
                        
                        
                            Against the green wood's dim expanse
                            The cat-tail tilts its tufted lance,
                        
                        
                            While on its tipone might declare
                            The white "snakefeeder" blossomed there!

                            I catch my breath, as children do
                            In woodland swings, when life is new,
                        
                        
                            And all the blood is warm as wine
                            And tingles with a tang divine.
                        
                        
                            My soul soars up the atmosphere
                            And sings aloud where God can hear,
                        
                        
                            And all my being leans intent
                            To mark his smiling wonderment.
                        
                        
                        
                            O gracious dream and gracious time,
                            And gracious theme and gracious rhyme
                        
                        
                            When buds of Spring begin to blow
                            In blossoms that we used to know
                        
                        
                            And lure us back along the ways
                            Of Time's all-golden yesterdays!

                            O HER eyes are amber-fine,
                            Dark and deep as wells of wine,
                            While her smile is like the noon
                            Splender of a day of June.
                            If she sorrow, lo her face
                            It is like a flowery space
                            In bright meadows overlaid
                            With light clouds and lulled with shade;
                            If she laugh, it is the trill
                            Of the wayward whippoorwill
                            Over upland pastures, heard
                            Echoed by the mocking-bird
                            In dim thickets, dense with bloom
                            And thick tangles of perfume;
                            If she sigh, there sinks and swells
                            The faint breath of asphodels
                            And wan lilies in lush plots
                            Of moon-drowned forget-me-nots.
                            Thenthe soft touch of her hand
                            Takes all breath to understand
                            What to liken it thereto!
                            Never rose-leaf rinsed with dew
                            
                            Might slip gentlier than slips
                            Her slow palm, the while her lips
                            Swoon through mine, with kiss on kiss
                            Sweet as heated honey is.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A LIFE-TERM.
                        
                            SHE was false, and he was true,
                            Thus their lives were rent apart;
                            'Twas his dagger driven through
                            A mad rival's heart.
                        
                        
                            He was shut away. The moon
                            May not find him; nor the stars
                            Nay, nor yet the sun of noon
                            Pierce his prison bars.
                        
                        
                            She was leftagain to sin
                            Mistress of all siren arts
                            The poor soulless heroine
                            Of a hundred hearts!
                        
                        
                            Though she dare not think of him
                            Who believed her lies, and so
                            Sent a ghost adown the dim
                            Path she dreads to go,
                        
                        
                            He, in fancy, smiling sips
                            Of her kisses, purer yet
                            Than the dew upon the lips
                            Of the violet.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        "GOD MOVES IN A MYSTERIOUS WAY."
                        "It will be an undoubtabel surprise to you to git the poem I now send to
                            you herein enclosed; but I was a-readin' one which starts out "God moves
                            in a mysterious way His wunders to purform," and the idy struck me that
                            I could write off somepin in that style which would express a man's
                            views that still ain't no perfessor of religion, ner a member of no
                            church, as I take fer granted Watts was when he wrote that and the rest
                            of all his hymn-book full of the same kind."
                        The poem sent is something of a surprise to us, but none the less a
                            pleasant one. But while we place it with pride before Mr. Riley's
                            admirers we beg to inform the author that while Mr. Watts has given to
                            hymnal literature a numberless array of very creditable verses, the poem
                            referred to by Mr. Riley is by no means a Watts production. "God Moves
                            in a Mysterious Way" was written by William Cowper, the English poet,
                            who was as little a pretender of religion, perhaps, as Mr. Riley
                            himself, since that famous poem was written immediately upon returning
                            from an unsuccessful attempt at suicidean idea which seems never to have
                            occurred to Mr. Watts.
                        Here is Mr. Riley's effort:
                        
                            O, THOU that doth all things devise
                            And fashion fer the best,
                            Help us who sees with mortal eyes
                            To overlook the rest.
                        
                        
                        
                            They's times, of course, we grope in doubt,
                            And in afflictions sore;
                            So, knock the louder, Lord, without,
                            And we'll unlock the door.
                        
                        
                            Make us to feel, when times looks bad
                            And tears in pitty melts,
                            Thou wast the only help we had
                            When they was nothin' else.
                        
                        
                            Death comes alike to every man
                            That ever was borned on earth,
                            Then let us do the best we can
                            To live fer all life's worth.
                        
                        
                            Ef storms and tempests, dread to see,
                            Makes black the heavens o'er,
                            They done the same in Galilee,
                            Six thousand years ago!
                        
                        
                            But, after all, the golden sun
                            Poured out its flood on them
                            That watched and waited fer the One
                            Then borned in Bethlehem.
                        
                        
                            Also the star of holy writ
                            Made noonday of the night,
                            While other stars that looked at it
                            Was envious with delight.
                        
                        
                        
                            The sages then in worship bowed
                            From every clime so fare:
                            O, sinner, think, of that glad crowd
                            That congregated thare!
                        
                        
                            They was content to fall in ranks
                            With one that knowed the way
                            From good old Jurden's stormy banks
                            Clean up to Judgement Day.
                        
                        
                            No matter, then, how all is mixed
                            In our near-sighted eyes,
                            All things is fer the best, and fixed
                            Out straight in Paradise.
                        
                        
                            Then take things as God sends 'em here,
                            And, ef we live er die,
                            Be more and more contenteder,
                            Without a-asking why.
                        
                        
                            O, thou that doth all things devise
                            And fashin fer the best,
                            Help us who sees with mortal eyes
                            To overlook the rest.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE CLOVER.
                        
                            SOME sings of the lily, and daisy, and
                                rose,
                            And the pansies and pinks that the summer-time throws
                            In the green and grassy lap of the medder that lays
                            Blinkin' up at the skies through the sunshiny days;
                            But what is the lily, and all the rest
                            Of the flowers to a man, with a heart in his breast
                            That was dipped brimmin' full of the honey and dew
                            Of the sweet clover-blossoms his babyhood knew?
                        
                        
                            I never set eyes on a clover-field now,
                            Er fool round a stable, er climb in the mow,
                            But my childhood comes back, jest as clear and as plain
                            As the smell of the clover I'm sniffin' again;
                            And I wander away, in a barefooted dream,
                            Where I tangle my toes in the blossoms that gleam
                            
                            With the dew of the dawn of the morning of love
                            Ere it wept o'er the graves that I'm weepin' above.
                        
                        
                            And so I love cloverit seems like a part
                            Of the sacredest sorrows and joys of my heart;
                            And wharever it blossoms, oh, thare let me bow
                            And thank the good God as I'm thankin' him now;
                            And pray to Him still fer the strength, when I die,
                            To go out in the clover and tell it good-bye,
                            And lovingly nestle my face in its bloom
                            While my soul slips away on a breath of perfume.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        HE CALLED HER IN.
                        
                            I.
                            HE called her in from me and shut the
                                door.
                            And she so loved the sunshine and the sky!
                            She loved them even better yet than I
                            That ne'er knew dearth of themmy mother dead,
                            Nature had nursed me in her lap instead,
                            And I had grown a dark and eerie child
                            That rarely smiled,
                            Save when, shut all alone in grasses high,
                            Looking straight up in God's great lonesome sky,
                            And coaxing mother to smile back on me.
                            'Twas lying thus, this fair girl suddenly
                            Came on me, nestled in the fields beside
                            A pleasant-seeming house, with doorway wide
                            The sunshine beating in upon the floor
                            Like golden rain
                            O sweet, sweet face above me, turn again
                            And leave me! I had cried, but that an ache
                            Within my throat so gripped it I could make
                            No sound but a thick sobbing. Cowering so,
                            I felt her light hand laid
                            
                            Upon my haira touch that ne'er before
                            Had tamed me thus, all soothed and unafraid
                            It seemed the touch the children used to know
                            When Christ was here, so dear it wasso dear,
                            At once I loved her as the leaves love dew
                            In midmost summer when the days are new.
                        
                        
                            Barely an hour I knew her; yet a curl
                            Of silken sunshine did she clip for me
                            Out of the bright May morning of her hair,
                            And bound and gave it to me laughingly,
                            And caught my hands and called me "Little girl,"
                            Tip-toeing as she spoke to kiss me there!
                            And I stood dazed and dumb for very stress
                            Of my great happiness.
                            She plucked me by the gown, nor saw how mean
                            The raimentdrew me with her everywhere:
                            Smothered her face in tufts of grasses green;
                            Put up her dainty hands and peeped between
                            Her fingers at the blossomscrooned and talked
                            To them in strange, glad whispers, as we walked,
                            Said this one was her angel motherthis,
                            Her baby-sistercome back, for a kiss,
                            Clean from the Good-World!smiled and kissed them, then
                        
                        
                        
                            Closed her soft eyes and kissed them o'er again.
                            And so did she beguile meso we played,
                            She was the dazzling shineI, the dark shade,
                            And we did mingle, like to these, and thus,
                            Together, made
                            The perfect summer, pure and glorious.
                            So blent we, till a harsh voice broke upon
                            Our happiness. She, startled as a fawn,
                            Cried, "Oh, 'tis Father!"all the blossoms gone
                            From out her cheeks as those from out her grasp.
                            Harsher the voice came;she could only gasp
                            Affrightedly, "Good-bye! good-bye! goodbye!"
                            And lo, I stood alone, with that harsh cry
                            Ringing a new and unknown sense of shame
                            Through soul and frame,
                            And, with wet eyes, repeating o'er and o'er,
                            "He called her in from me and shut the door!"
                        
                        
                            II.
                            He called her in from me and shut the door!
                            And I went wandering alone again
                            So lonelyO, so very lonely then,
                            I thought no little, sallow star, alone
                            In all a world of twilight, e'er had known
                            Such utter loneliness. But that I wore
                            
                            Above my heart that gleaming tress of hair
                            To lighten up the night of my despair,
                            I think I might have groped into my grave,
                            Nor cared to wave
                            The ferns above it with a breath of prayer.
                            And how I hungered for the sweet, sweet face
                            That bent above me in my hiding-place
                            That day amid the grasses there beside
                            Her pleasant home!"Her pleasant home?" I sighed,
                            Remembering;then shut my teeth and feigned
                            The harsh voice called to me, then clinched my nails
                            So deeply in my palms, the sharp wounds pained,
                            And tossed my face toward heaven, as one who pales
                            In splendid martyrdom, with soul serene,
                            As near to God as high the guillotine.
                            And I had envied her? Not thatO no!
                            But I had longed for some sweet haven so!
                            Wherein the tempest-beaten heart might ride
                            Sometimes at peaceful anchor, and abide
                            Where those that loved me touched me with their hands,
                            And looked upon me with glad eyes, and slipped
                            Smooth fingers o'er my brow, and lulled the strands
                            
                            Of my wild tresses, as they backward tipped
                            My yearning face and kissed it, satisfied!
                            Then bitterly I murmured as before
                            "He called her in from me and shut the door."
                        
                        
                            III.
                            He called her in from me and shut the door!
                            After long struggling with my pride and pain
                            A weary while it seemed, in which the more
                            I held myself from her, the greater fain
                            Was I to look upon her face again
                            At last! at last!half conscious where my feet
                            Were faring, I stood waist-deep in the sweet
                            Green grasses there where she
                            First came to me.
                            The very blossoms she had plucked that day,
                            And, at her father's voice, had cast away,
                            Around me lay,
                            Still bright and blooming in these eyes of mine;
                            And as I gathered each one eagerly,
                            I pressed it to my lips and drank the wine
                            Her kisses left there for the honey-bee.
                            Then, after I had laid them with the tress
                            Of her bright hair, with lingering tenderness,
                            I, turning, crept on to the hedge that bound
                            Her pleasant-seeming home but all around
                            Was never sign of her! The windows all
                            
                            Were blinded; and I heard no rippling fall
                            Of her glad laugh, nor any harsh voice call:
                            But, clutching to the tangled grasses, caught
                            A sound as though a strong man bowed his head
                            And sobbed aloneunloveduncomforted;
                            And then straightway before
                            My tearless eyes, all vividly, was wrought
                            A vision that is with me evermore;
                            A little girl that lies asleep, nor hears
                            Nor heeds not any voice, or fall of tears
                            And I sit singing o'er and o'er and o'er,
                            "God called her in from him and shut the door!"
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        SONG.
                        
                            THERE is ever a song somewhere, my dear;
                            There is ever a something that sings alway;
                            There's the song of the lark when the skies are clear
                            And the song of the thrush when the skies are
                                gray.
                            The sunshine showers across the grain,
                            And the bluebird trills in the orchard tree,
                            And in and out, when the eaves drip rain,
                            The swallows are twittering ceaselessly.
                        
                        
                            There is ever a song somewhere, my dear;
                            Be the skies above or dark or fair,
                            There is ever a song that our hearts may hear
                            There is ever a song somewhere, my dear
                            There is ever a song somewhere!
                        
                        
                            There is ever a song somewhere, my dear;
                            In the midnight black or the mid-day blue;
                            The robin pipes when the sun is here,
                            And the cricket chirrups the whole night
                                through.
                        
                        
                        
                            The buds may blow and the fruit may grow,
                            And the Autumn leaves drop crisp and sere;
                            But whether the sun, or the rain, or the snow,
                            There is ever a song somewhere, my dear.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE AMIABLE OLD SISTER.
                        
                            THERE are four of us girls in the
                                family,
                            Margaret, Jennie, and Tillie and I;
                            And Margaret is the oldestthus
                            She is the model held up for us.
                        
                        
                            And she is so moralso modestMy!
                            So gentle-voiced, and so dainty sweet!
                            She always writes her name "Marguerite;"
                            Mag is the name we call her by!
                        
                        
                            She lifts her brows, at our worldly chat
                            Of party, and picnic, and themes like that,
                            With such a sister-superior air,
                            St. Cicely wouldn't be anywhere!
                        
                        
                            So everybody, as you'd infer,
                            Thinks the-world-and-all of her
                            Everybody but, by the bye,
                            Her sisters, Jennie and Tillie and I!
                        
                        
                            Mag never hadand Mag never will
                            Have a beau of her own! So she lies in wait
                            For ours; and "tabbys" around until
                            They grab their hats and evaporate!
                        
                        
                        
                            You should see her when Jennie's beau
                            Calls sometimes, and Mag remains
                            There in the parlor and "entertains"
                            The poor bored boy till he has to go!
                        
                        
                            Jennie came crying to bed last night,
                            Red in the cheeks and white at the lips
                            Lawzy! if murder were only right,
                            Mag would never have seen daylight!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        GIVE ME THE BABY. Page 99.
                    
                    
                    
                        "GIVE ME THE BABY."
                        
                            GIVE me the baby to hold, my dear
                            To hold and to hug, and to love and kiss.
                            Ah! he will come to me, never a fear
                            Come to the nest of a breast like this,
                            As warm for him as his face with cheer.
                            Give me the baby to hold, my dear
                        
                        
                            Trustfully yield him to my caress.
                            "Bother," you say? what! "a bother" to me?
                            To fill up my soul with such happiness
                            As the love of a baby that laughs to be
                            Snuggled away where my heart can hear!
                            Give me the baby to hold, my dear!
                        
                        
                            Ah! but his hands are soiled, you say,
                            And would dirty my laces and clutch my hair
                            Well, what would pleasure me more, I pray,
                            Than the touch and the tug of the wee hands
                                there?
                            The wee hands there, and the warm face here
                            Give me the baby to hold, my dear!
                        
                        
                        
                            Give me the baby! (O won't you see?

                            HOT weather? Yes; but really not,
                            Compared with weather twice as hot.
                            Find comfort, then, in arguing thus,
                            And you'll pull through victorious;
                            For instance, whule you gasp and pant

                            The weather now is cool indeed!
                            Thinkas the perspiration dews
                            Your fevered brow, and seems to ooze

                            Whole floods of it, with floods to spare
                            Think, I repeat, the while the sweat
                            Pours down your spinehow hotter yet
                            Just ninety more degrees would be,
                            And bear this ninety patiently!
                            Thinkas you rise from knoll or chair
                            With sticky feelings everywhere
                            
                            How ninety more degrees increase
                            Of heat like this would start the grease;
                            Or, think, as you exhausted stand,
                            A wilted "palmleaf" in each hand
                            When the thermometer has done
                            With ease the lap of ninety-one,
                            O think, I say, what heat might do
                            At one hundred and eighty-two
                            Just twice the heat you now declare
                            Complainingly, is hard to bear.
                            Or, as you watch the mercury
                            Mount, still elate, one more degree,
                            And doff your collar and cravat,
                            And rig a sponge up in your hat,
                            And ask Tom, Harry, Dick and Jim
                            If this is hot enough for him
                            Consider how the sun would pour
                            At one hundred and eighty-four
                            Just twice the heat that seems to be
                            Affecting you unpleasantly
                            The very hour that you might find
                            As cool as dew, were you inclined.
                            But why proceed when none will heed
                            Advice apportioned to the need?
                            Hot weather? Yes; but really not,
                            Compared with weather twice as hot!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        TO A BENEDICT FRIEND.
                        
                            DEAR MAN happy husband
                                and rapturous father,
                            My heart bubbles over with joy
                            To hear, high above all my bachelor bother,
                            My Benedict friend has a boy!
                            Though to note your delight
                            In the rhymes that you write
                            Makes me envious in a degree,
                            I am tickled clean through
                            That the babe, having you,
                            Has a far better father than me.
                        
                        
                            Then whoop and hoo-ray for both father and mother!
                            And whoop and hoo-ray for the heir!
                            May the hearts of you all, shuffled up with each other,
                            Yield ever this ace and a pair!
                            'Tis a fortunate deal;
                            And whatever I feel
                            Of envy is lost in my joy,
                            Because you're its pa,
                            And your wife is its ma,
                            And because its like meIt's a boy!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A SUDDEN SHOWER.
                        
                            THE noon is tropical. The rose
                            Leans like a yearning mouth to meet
                            The kisses that the zephyr blows
                            Full-flavored with the fragrant heat.
                        
                        
                            The breezy maples seem to quaff
                            The shade like wine, and, thrilled with glee,
                            Toss up their leafy hands and laugh
                            And lisp and whisper tipsily.
                        
                        
                            As in the sight the air afloat
                            The meadow glimmers on to us,
                            A glamoured murmur, nigh, remote,
                            Falls on the hearing tremulous.
                        
                        
                            The pent-up anger of the storm!
                            The dust grows ashen, as with fright,
                            And, rising, reels in phantom form,
                            And passes in convulsive flight.
                        
                        
                            With petulant and gusty breaths
                            The winds come waltzing as they may,
                            Till e'en the sunshine vanishes
                            As it were whirled and blown away
                        
                        
                        
                            Barefooted boys scud up the street,
                            Or skurry under sheltering sheds,
                            And school-girl faces, pale and sweet,
                            Gleam from the shawls about their heads.
                        
                        
                            Doors bang; and mother-voices call
                            From alien homes; and rusty gates
                            Are slammed, and high above it all
                            The thunder grim articulates.
                        
                        
                            And then, abrupt, the rain! the rain!
                            The earth lies gasping; and the eyes
                            Behind the streaming window-pane
                            Smile at the trouble of the skies.
                        
                        
                            The highway smokes; sharp echoes ring;
                            The cattle bawl, and cow-bells clank:
                            And into town comes galloping
                            The farmer's horse, with steaming flank.
                        
                        
                            The swallow dips beneath the eaves
                            And flirts his plumes and folds his wings;
                            And under the catawba leaves
                            The caterpillar curls and clings.
                        
                        
                            The bumble-bee is pelted down
                            The wet stem of the hollyhock;
                            And sullenly, in spattered brown,
                            The cricket leaps the garden walk.
                        
                        
                        
                            Within, the baby claps his hands
                            And crows with rapture strange and vague;
                            Without, beneath the rosebush stands
                            A dripping rooster on one leg.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A MERE OUTLINE.
                        
                            AH, help me! but her face and brow
                            Were lovelier than the lilies are
                            Beneath the light of moon and star
                            That smile as they are smiling now
                            White lilies in a pallid swoon
                            Of sweetest white beneath the moon
                            White lilies in a flood of bright,
                            Pure lucidness of liquid light
                            That overflows some night of June
                            When all the azure overhead
                            Blooms like a dazzling daisy-bed.
                            So marvelous her face and brow,
                            Their beauty blinds my fancy now.
                        
                        
                            And therethe oval chin below,
                            Carved, like a cunning cameo,
                            With one exquisite dimple, swirled
                            With swimming light and shade, and whirled
                            The daintiest vortex poets know
                            The sweetest whirlpool ever twirled
                            By Cupid's finger-tipand so
                            The deadliest maelstrom in the world.
                            
                            And O!bewilderment gone mad
                            And riotous!what eyes she had!
                            Let any dew-drop soak the hue
                            Of any violet through and through,
                            And then be colorless and dull
                            Compared with eyes so beautiful!
                            I tell you that her eyes were bright
                            As noonday and as dark as night
                            As bright as are the burnished bars
                            Of rainbows set in sunny skies,
                            And yet as deep and darkher eyes
                            And lustrous-black as blown-out stars.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A DREAM OF AUTUMN.
                        
                            AS A harvester, at dusk,
                            Faring down some woody trail
                            Leading homeward through the musk
                            Of may-apple and pawpaw,
                            Hazel-bush and spice and haw
                            So comes Autumn, swart and hale,
                            Drooped of frame and slow of stride,
                            But withal an air of pride;
                            Looming up in stature far
                            Higher than his shoulders are:
                            Weary both in arm and limb,
                            Yet the wholesome heart of him
                            Sheer at rest and satisfied.
                        
                        
                            Greet him as with glee of drums
                            And glad cymbals, as he comes!
                            Robe him fair, O Rain and Shine!
                            He the Emperorthe King
                            Royal prince of everything;
                            Sagging Plenty's granary floors,
                            And out-bulging all her doors:
                            He the god of corn and wine,
                            Honey, milk, and fruit and oil
                            
                            Lord of feast, as lord of toil
                            Jocund host of yours and mine!
                        
                        
                            Ho! the revel in his laugh!
                            Half is sound of winds, and half
                            Roar of ruddy blazes drawn
                            Up the throats of chimneys wide,
                            Circling which, from side to side,
                            Faceslit as by the Dawn,
                            With her highest tintings on
                            Tip of nose and cheek and chin
                            Smile at some old fairy tale
                            Of enchanted lovers, in
                            Silken gown and coat of mail,
                            With a retinue of elves,
                            Merry as their very selves,
                            Trooping ever, hand in hand,
                            Down the dales of Wonderland.
                        
                        
                            Then, the glory of his song!
                            Lifting up his dreamy eyes
                            Singing haze across the skies
                            Singing clouds that trail along
                            Towering tops of trees that seize
                            Tufts of them to stanch the breeze:
                            Singing slanted strands of rain
                            In between the sky and earth
                            For the lyre to mate the mirth
                            
                            And the might of his refrain;
                            Singing southward-flying birds
                            Down to us, and afterwards
                            Singing them to flight again;
                            Singing blushes to the cheeks
                            Of the leaves upon the trees
                            Singing on, and changing these
                            Into pallor, slowly wrought,
                            Till the little wayward creeks
                            Bear them to their last farewell,
                            As Elaine, the lovable,
                            Floated down to Lancelot,
                            Singing drip of tears, and then
                            Drying them with smiles again.
                        
                        
                            Singing apple, peach and grape
                            Into roundest, plumpest shape;
                            Rosy ripeness to the face
                            Of the pippin; and the grace
                            Of the dainty stamin-tip
                            To the huge form of the pear,
                            Pendant in the green caress
                            Of the leaves, and glowing through
                            With a yellow haziness
                            Of the gold that Ophir knew
                            Haply, too, within its rind
                            Such a cleft as bees may find,
                            Bungling on it half aware,
                            
                            And wherein to see them sip,
                            Fancy lifts an oozy lip,
                            And the singer's falters there.
                        
                        
                            Sweet as swallows swimming through
                            Eddyings of dusk and dew,
                            Singing happy scenes of home
                            Into sight of eager eyes
                            That have longed for them to come,
                            Till their coming is surprise
                            Uttered only by the rush
                            Of quick tears and prayerful hush;
                            Singing on, in clearer key,
                            Hearty palms of you and me
                            Into grasps that tingle still
                            Rapturous, and ever will;
                            Singing twank and twang of strings
                            Trill of flute and clarinet
                            In a melody that rings
                            Like the tunes they used to play,
                            And our dreams are playing yet:
                            Singing lovers, long astray,
                            Each to each; and, sweeter things,
                            Singing in their marriage-day,
                            And a banquet holding all
                            These delights for festival.

                            The laugh of Momus, tempered daintily

                            The robe de chambre, and the russet gown;

                            Of the Bedouin Ben Ahrzz
                            Nobler never loved the stars.

                            So he slept, and, even so,
                            Sleeping in the robbers' tent,
                            Morning came at last, and lo,
                            He had not a single cent,
                            Nor a thought but pure content.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        JOSH BILLINGS.
                        Dead in California, October 15th, 1885.
                        
                            JOLLY-HEARTED old Josh
                                Billings,
                            With his wisdom and his wit,
                            And his gravity of presence,
                            And the drollery of it!
                            Has he left us, and forever?
                            When so many merry years
                            He has only left us laughing
                            And he leaves us now in tears!
                        
                        
                            Has he turned from his "Deer Publik,"
                            With his slyly-twinkling eyes
                            Grown dim and heavy lidded
                            In despite of sunny skies?
                            Yet with rugged brow uplifted,
                            And the long hair tossed away,
                            Like an old heroic lion,
                            With a mane of iron-gray.
                        
                        
                            Though we lose him, still we find him
                            In the mirth of every lip,
                            And we fare through all his pages
                            In his glad companionship;
                            
                            His voice is wed with Nature's,
                            Laughing in each woody nook
                            With the chirrup of the robin
                            And the chuckle of the brook.
                        
                        
                            But the childrenO the children!
                            They who leaped to his caress,
                            And felt his arms about them,
                            And his love and tenderness,
                            Wherewhere will they find comfort
                            As their tears fall like the rain,
                            And they swarm his face with kisses
                            That he answers not again?

                            But where's the peace and comfort that we all had
                                before?

                            Of the art

                            And in rhyme,

                            From the glooms
                            Of a century of tombs,
                            And the blood he spilled at Lexington in living beauty

                            Of a purpose pure and wise,
                            As the love of them is lifted to a something in the skies
                            That is bright
                            Red and white,
                            With a blur of starry light,
                            As it laughs in silken ripples to the breezes day and
                                night.

                            And the murmur, fainter growing, on the silence falls
                                asleep,
                            While the prayer
                            Rising there
                            Wills the sea and earth and air
                            As a heritage to Freedom's sons and daughters everywhere.
                        
                        
                        
                            Then, with sound
                            As profound
                            As the thunderings resound,
                            Come thy wild reverberations in a throe that shakes the
                                ground,
                            And a cry
                            Flung on high,
                            Like the flag it flutters by,
                            Wings rapturously upward till it nestles in the sky.

                                stood
                            As solemn, fer a minute, as a' undertaker would.

                                specs
                            And as she rushes for the stranger, she hollers out, "It's

                            Thank God we've met him comin'! Don't you know your mother,

                            Whistles his name in high delight,
                            And whirrs away. I wunder still

                            Where trees has fell, with tangled tops
                            Where dead leaves shakes, I stop fer breath,

                            With curls as brown and fair and fine
                            As tendrils of the wild-grape vine

                            And happiness as worlds is worth

                            Father believed in 'em all his life
                            But mother, at first, she'd shake her head
                            Till after the battle of Champion Hill,
                            When many a flag in the winder-sill
                            Had crape mixed in with the white and red.
                        
                        
                            I used to doubt 'em myself till then
                            But me and mother was satisfied
                            When Ellen she set, and father came
                            And rapped "Godbless you," and mother's name,
                            And "The flag's up here." And we all just
                                cried!
                        
                        
                        
                            Used to come often after that,
                            And talk to us just as he used to do,
                            Pleasantest kind! And once, for John,
                            He said he was lonesome but wouldn't let on
                            Fear mother would worry and Emmy and Lou.
                        
                        
                            But Lou was the bravest girl on earth
                            For all she was never hale nor strong
                            She'd have her fun! With her voice clean lost
                            She'd laugh and joke us that when she crossed
                            To father, we'd all come taggin' along!
                        
                        
                            Diedjust that way! And the raps was thick
                            That night, as they often since occur,
                            Extry loud. And when Lou got back
                            She said it was father and herand whack!
                            She took the tableand we knowed HER!
                        
                        
                            John and Emmy, in five years more,
                            Both had went.And it seemed like fate!
                            For the old home it burnt down,but Jane
                            And me and Ellen we built again
                            The new house here on the old estate.
                        
                        
                            And a happier family I don't know
                            Of anywheresunless its THEM
                            Father, with all his love for Lou,
                            
                            And her there with him, and healthy, too,
                            And laughin' with John and little Em.
                        
                        
                            And, first we moved in the new house here,
                            They all dropped in for a long pow-wow.
                            "We like your buildin', of course," Lou said,
                            "But wouldn't swop with you to save your head
                            For we live in the ghost of the old house, now."
                        
                    
                
                
                
                    WINTER FANCIES
                    
                    
                        IT'S A COLD DAY.
                        
                            I.
                            WINTER without
                            And warmth within!
                            The winds may shout
                            And the storm begin:
                            The snows may pack
                            At the window pane,
                            And the skies grow black,
                            And the sun remain
                            Hidden away
                            The livelong day
                            But herein here is the warmth of May!
                        
                        
                            II.
                            Swoop your spitefullest!
                            Up the flue,
                            Wild windsdo!
                            What in the world do I care for you?
                            O, delightfullest
                            Weather of all!
                            Howl and squall,
                            And shake the trees till the last leaves fall!
                        
                        
                        
                            III.
                            The joy one feels,
                            In an easy chair,
                            Cocking his heels
                            In the dancing air
                            That wreathes the rim of a roaring stove,
                            Whose heat loves better than hearts can love,
                            Will not permit
                            The coldest day
                            To drive away
                            The fire in his blood, and the bliss of it!
                        
                        
                            IV.
                            Then blow, Winds! blow,
                            And rave and shriek,
                            And snarl and snow
                            Till your breath grows weak
                            While here in my room
                            I'm as snugly shut
                            As a glad little worm
                            In the heart of a nut!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A BRAVE REFRAIN.
                        Imitated.
                        
                            WHEN snow is here, and the trees look
                                weird,
                            And the knuckled twigs are gloved with frost;
                            When the breath congeals in the drover's beard,
                            And the old pathway to the barn is lost;
                            When the rooster's crow is sad to hear,
                            And the stamp of the stabled horse is vain,
                            And the tone of the cow-bell grieves the ear
                            O then is the time for a brave refrain!
                        
                        
                            When the gears hang stiff on the harness-peg,
                            And the tallow gleams in frozen streaks,
                            And the old hen stands on a lonesome leg,
                            And the pump sounds hoarse and the handle
                                squeaks;
                            When the woodpile lies in a jumbled heap,
                            And the frost is scratched from the
                                window-ane,
                            And anxious eyes from the inside peep
                            O then is the time for a brave refrain!
                        
                        
                            When the ax-helve warms at the chimney-jam,
                            And the hob-nailed boots on the hearth below,
                            
                            And the house-cat curls in a slumber calm,
                            And the eight-day clock ticks loud and slow;
                            When the harsh broom-handle jabs the ceil
                            'Neath the kitchen-loft, and the drowsy brain
                            Sniffs the breath of the morning meal!
                            O then is the time for a brave refrain!
                        
                        
                            'ENVOI.
                            When the skillet seethes, and a blubbering hot
                            Tilts the lid of the coffee-pot,
                            And the scent of the buckwheat cake grows plain
                            O then is the time for a brave refrain.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        AS I SIT IN THE SILENCE.
                        
                            ALL the pleasures of home have been numbered
                                and sung,
                            And, borne on the winds of the world, they have
                                beat
                            With their tremulous wings at the hearts of the young,
                            And in bosoms of age found as warm a retreat;
                            And sweetest of all of the musical throng,
                            Yet least of the numbers that upward aspire,
                            Is the one rising now into wavering song,
                            As I sit in the silence and gaze in the fire.
                        
                        
                            'Tis a Winter long dead that beleaguers my door
                            And muffles his steps in the snows of the
                                past,
                            And I see in the embers I'm dreaming before
                            Lost faces of love as they looked on me last
                            The round, laughing eyes of a desk-mate of old
                            Gleam out for a moment with truant desire,
                            Then fade and are lost in a city of gold,
                            As I sit in the silence and gaze in the fire.
                        
                        
                            And then comes the face, peering back in my own,
                            Of a shy little girl with her lids drooping
                                low,
                            
                            As she faltering tells, in a faraway tone,
                            The ghost of a story of long, long ago
                            Then her dewy blue eyes they are lifted again,
                            But I see their glad light slowly fall and
                                expire,
                            And I reach and cry to her in vain, all in vain,
                            As I sit in the silence and gaze in the fire.
                        
                        
                            Then the face of a mother looks back through the mist
                            Of the tears that are welling, and lucent with
                                light,
                            I see the dear smile of the lips I have kissed
                            As she knelt by my cradle at morning and
                                night;
                            And my arms are outheld with a yearning too wild
                            For any but God in his love to inspire,
                            As she pleads at the foot of His throne for her child,
                            As I sit in the silence and gaze in the fire.
                        
                        
                            O pathos of rapture! O glorious pain!
                            My heart is a blossom of joy over-run
                            With a shower of tears, as a lily with rain,
                            That weeps in the shadow and laughs in the
                                sun.
                            
                            The blight of the Winter may fall on the tree,
                            And the leaf and the flower may fall and
                                expire,
                            But ever and ever love blossoms for me,
                            As I sit in the silence and gaze in the fire.

                            the one side of the St. Joseph river, but quite a respectable fraction
                            thereof taking its industrial way to the opposite shore, and there
                            gaining an audience and a hearing in the rather imposing growth and
                            hurly-burly of its big manufactories, and the consequent rapid
                            appearance of multitudinous neat cottages, tenement houses and business
                            blocks. A stranger, entering South Bend proper on an ordinary day, will
                            be at some loss to account for its very prosperous appearance its
                            flagged and bowldered streetsits handsome mercantile blocks, banks and
                            business houses generally. Reasoning from cause to effect, and seeing
                            but a meagre sprinkling of people on the streets throughout the day, and
                            these seeming, for the most part, merely idlers, and in no wise
                            accessory to the evident thrift and opulence of their surroundings, the
                            observant stranger will be puzzled at the situation. But when evening
                            comes, and the outlying foundries, sewing-machine, wagon, plow, and
                            other " works," together  with the paper
                            mills and all the nameless industrieswhen the operations of all these
                            are suspended for the day, and the workmen and workwomen loosed from
                            laborthen, as this vast army suddenly invades and overflows bridge,
                            roadway, street and lane, the startled stranger will fully comprehend
                            the why and wherefore of the city's high prosperity. And, once
                            acquainted with the people there, the fortunate sojourner will find no
                            ordinary culture and intelligence, and, as certainly, he will meet with
                            a social spirit and a whole-souled heartiness that will make the place a
                            lasting memory. The town, too, is the home of many world-known notables,
                            and a host of local celebrities, the chief of which latter class I
                            found, during my stay there, in the person of Tommy Stafford, or "The
                            Wild Irishman," as everybody called him.
                        "Talk of odd fellows and eccentric characters," said Major Blowney, my
                            employer, one afternoon, "you must see our 'Wild Irishman' here before
                            you say you've yet found the queerest, brightest, cleverest chap in all
                            your travels. What d' ye say, Stockford?" And the Major paused in his
                            work of charging cartridges for his new breech-loading shotgun and
                            turned to await his partner's response,
                        Stockford, thus addressed, paused above the  shield sign he was lettering, slowly smiling as he dipped and trailed
                            his pencil through the ivory black upon a bit of broken glass and said
                            in his deliberate, half - absent - minded way, "Is it Tommy you are
                            telling him about?" and then, with a gradual broadening of the smile, he
                            went on, "Well, I should say so. Tommy! What's come of the fellow,
                            anyway? I haven't seen him since his last bout with the mayor, on his
                            trial for shakin' up that fast-horse man."
                        "The fast-horse man got just exactly what he needed, too," said the
                            genial Major, laughing, and mopping his perspiring brow. "The fellow was
                            barkin' up the wrong stump when he tackled Tommy! Got beat in the trade,
                            at his own game, you know, and wound up by an insult that no Irishman
                            would take; and Tommy just naturally wore out the hall carpet of the old
                            hotel with him!"
                        " And then collared and led him to the mayor's office himself, they
                            say!"
                        "Oh, he did!" said the Major, with a dash of pride in the confirmation;
                            "that's Tommy all over!"
                        "Funny trial, wasn't it?" continued the ruminating Stockford.
                        "Wasn't it, though?" laughed the Major. "The porter's testimony: You see,
                            he was for  Tommy, of course, and on
                            examination testified that the horse-man struck Tommy first. And Tommy
                            broke in with: 'He's a-meanin' well, yer Honor, but he's lyin' to yehe's
                            lyin' to ye. No livin' man iver struck me firstnor last, nayther, for
                            the matter o' that!' And I thought the court would die," concluded the
                            Major, in a like imminent state of merriment.
                        "Yes, and he said if he struck him first," supplemented Stockford, "he'd
                            like to know why the horse-man was wearin' all the black eyes, and the
                            blood, and the boomps on the head of um!' And it's that talk of his that
                            got him off with so light a fine!"
                        "As it always does," said the Major, coming to himself abruptly and
                            looking at his watch. "Stock', you say you're not going along with our
                            duck-shooting party this time? The old Kankakee is just lousy with 'em
                            this season!"
                        "Can't go possibly," said Stockford, "not on account of the work at all,
                            but the folks at home ain't as well as I'd like to see them, and I'll
                            stay here till they're better. Next time I'll try and be ready for you.
                            Going to take Tommy, of course?"
                        "Of course! Got to have 'The Wild Irishman' with us! I'm going around to
                            find him now." Then turning to me the Major continued,  "Suppose you get on your coat and hat and
                            come along. It's the best chance you'll ever have to meet with Tommy.
                            It's late anyhow, and Stockford'll get along without you. Come on!"
                        "Certainly," said Stockford; "Go ahead. And you can take him ducking,
                            too, if he wants to go."
                        "But he doesn't want to goand won't go," replied the Major with a
                            commiserative glance at me. "Says he doesn't know a duck from a
                            poll-parrotnor how to load a shot-gunand couldn't hit a house if he were
                            inside of it and the door shut. Admits that he nearly killed his uncle
                            once, on the other side of a tree, with a squirrel runnin' down it.
                            Don't want him along!"
                        Reaching the street with the genial Major, he gave me this advice: "Now,
                            when you meet Tommy, you mustn't take all he says for dead earnest, and
                            you musn't believe, because he talks loud, and in italics every other
                            word, that he wants to do all the talking and won't be interfered with.
                            That's the way he's apt to strike folks at firstbut it's their mistake,
                            not his. Talk back to himcontrovert him whenever he's aggressive in the
                            utterance of his opinions, and if you're only honest in the announcement
                            of your own ideas and beliefs, he'll like you all the better  for standing by them. He's quick
                            tempered, and perhaps a trifle sensitive, so share your greater patience
                            with him, and he'll pay you back by fighting for you at the drop of the
                            hat. In short, he's as nearly typical of his oppressed country's brave,
                            impetuous, fun-loving individuality as such a likeness can exist."
                        "But is he quarrelsome? "I asked.
                        "Not at all. There's the trouble. If he'd only quarrel, there'd be no
                            harm done. Quarreling's cheap, and Tommy's extravagant. A big blacksmith
                            here, the other day, kicked some boy out of his shop, and Tommy, on his
                            cart, happened to be passing at the time; and he just jumped off without
                            a word, and went in and worked on that fellow for about three minutes,
                            with such disastrous results that they couldn't tell his shop from a
                            slaughter-house; paid an assault and battery fine, and gave the boy a
                            dollar beside, and the whole thing was a positive luxury to him! But I
                            guess we'd better drop the subject, for here's his cart, and here's
                            Tommy. Hi! there, you 'far-down' Irish Mick!" called the Major, in
                            affected antipathy, "been out raiding the honest farmers' hen-roosts
                            again, have you?"
                        We halted at a corner grocery and produce store, as I took it, and the
                            smooth-faced, shave-headed man in woolen shirt, short vest, and
                            suspenderless  trousers so boisterously
                            addressed by the Major, was just lifting from the back of his cart a
                            coop of cackling chickens.
                        "Arrah,' ye blasted Kerryonian!" replied the handsome fellow, depositing
                            the coop on the currio and straightening his tall, slender figure; "I
                            were jist thinkin' of yez and the ducks, and here ye come quackin' into
                            the prisence of r'yalty, wid yer canvas-back suit upon ye and the
                            shwimskins bechuxt yer toes! How air yez, anyhowand air we startin' for
                            the Kankakee by the nixt post?"
                        "We're to start just as soon as we get the boys together," said the
                            Major, shaking hands. "The crowd's to be at Andrews' by 4, and it fully
                            that now; so come on at once. We'll go 'Round by Munson's and have Hi
                            send a boy to look after your horse. Come; and I want to introduce my
                            friend here to you, and we'll all want to smoke and jabber a little in
                            appropriate seclusion. Come on" And the impatient Major had linked arms
                            with his hesitating ally and my-L self and was turning the corner of the
                            street.
                        "It's an hour's work I have yet wid the squawkers," mildly protested
                            Tommy, still hanging back and stepping a trifle high; "but, as one
                            Irishman would say til another, 'Ye're wrong, but I'm wid ye!'"
                        
                        And five minutes later the three of us had joined a very jolly party in a
                            snug back room, with
                        
                            The chamber walls depicted all around
                            With portraitures of huntsman, hawk, and hound,
                            And the hurt deer.
                        
                        And where, as well, drifted over the olfactory intelligence a certain
                            subtle, warm-breathed aroma, that genially combatted the chill and
                            darkness of the day without, and, resurrecting long-dead Christmases,
                            brimmed the grateful memory with all comfortable cheer.
                        A dozen hearty voices greeted the appearance of Tommy and the Major, the
                            latter adroitly pushing the jovial Irishman to the front, with a
                            mock-heroic introduction to the general company at the conclusion of
                            which Tommy, with his hat tucked under his left elbow, stood bowing with
                            a grace of pose and presence Lord Chesterfield might have applauded.
                        "Gintlemen," said Tommy, settling back upon his heels and admiringly
                            contemplating the group; "Gintlemen, I congratulate you wid a pride that
                            shoves the thumbs o' me into the arrum holes of me weshkit! At the
                            inshtigation of the bowld O'Blowneyaxin' the gintleman's pardon I am
                            here wid no silver tongue of illoquence to  paralyze you, but I am prisent, as has been ripresinted, to jine wid
                            yo in a stupindeous waste of gun-powther, and duck-shot, and
                            'High-wines,' and ham sand-witches, upon the silvonian banks of the
                            ragin' Kankakee, where the 'di-dipper' tips ye good-bye wid his tail,
                            and the wild loon skoots like a sky-rocket for his exiled home in the
                            alien dunes of the wild morassor, as Tommy Moore so illegautly describes
                            the blashted birrud, 
                                
                                    'Away to the dishmal shwamp he shpeeds 
                                    His path is rugged and sore,
                                    Through tangled juniper, beds of reeds,
                                    And many a fen where the serpent feeds,
                                    And birrud niver flew before
                                    And niver will fly any more'

                            in the poultry business long enough to know the private opinion and
                            personal integrity of every fowl that flies the air or roosts on poles.
                            But, changin' the subject of my few small remarks here, and thankin' you
                            wid an overflowin' heart but a dhry tongue, I have the to honor to
                            propose, gintlemen, long life and health to every mother's son o' ye,
                            and success to the 'Duck-hunters of the Kankakee.'"
                        "The Duck-hunters of the Kankakee!" chorused the elated party in such
                            musical uproar that for a full minute the voice of the enthusiastic  Majorwho was trying to say somethingcould
                            not be heard. Then he said:
                        "I want to propose that theme" The Duck-hunters of the Kankakee for one
                            of Tommy's improvizations. I move we have a song now from Tommy on the
                            'Duck-hunters of the Kan-kakee.'"
                        "Hurra! hurra! A song from Tommy," cried the crowd. "Make us up a song,
                            and put us all into it! A song from Tommy! A song! a song!"
                        There was a queer light in the eye of the Irishman. I observed him
                            narrowly-expectantly. Often I had read of this phenomenal art of
                            improvised balled-singing, but had always remained a little skeptical in
                            regard to the possibility of such a feat. Even in the notable instances
                            of this gift as displayed by the very clever Theodore Hook, I had always
                            half suspected some prior preparationsome adroit forecasting of the
                            sequence that seemed the inspiration of his witty verses. Here was
                            evidently to be a test-example, and mechanically I found pencil and
                            blank paper in my hand.
                        The clamor had subsided, and Tommy had drawn a chair near to and directly
                            fronting the Major's. His right hand was extended, closely grasping the
                            right hand of his friend which he  scarce
                            perceptibly, though measureedly, lifted and let fall throughout the
                            length of all the curious performance. The voice was not unmusical, nor
                            was the quaint old ballad-air adopted by the singer unlovely in the
                            least; simply a monotony was evident that accorded with the levity and
                            chance-finish of the improvisationand that the song was improvised on
                            the instant I am certain though in no wise remarkable, for other
                            reasons, in rhythmic worth or finish. And while his smiling auditors all
                            drew nearer, and leant, with parted lips, to catch every syllable, the
                            words of strange melody trailed unhesitatingly into the lines literally
                            as here subjoined:
                        
                            One gloomy day in in the airly fall,
                            Whin the sunshine had no chance at all
                            No chance at all for to gleam and shine
                            And lighten up this heart of mine:
                        
                        
                            "Twas in South Bend, that famous town,
                            Whilst I were a-strollin' round and round,
                            I met some friends, and they says to me,
                            "Its a hunt we'll take on the Kankakee!"
                        
                        "Hurra! for the Kankakee! Give it to us, Tommy!" cried an enthused voice
                            between verses. "Now give it to the Major!" And the song went on:
                        
                            There's Major Blowney leads the van,
                            As crack a shot as an Irishman,
                            
                            For it's the duck is a tin decoy
                            That his old shotgun can't destroy!
                        
                        And half a dozen jubilant palms patted the Major's shoulders, and his
                            ruddy, good-natured face beamed with delight. "Now give it to the rest
                            of 'em, Tommy!" chuckled the Major. And the song continued:
                        
                            And along wid 'Hank' is Mick Maharr,
                            And Barney Pince, at 'The Shamrock' bar
                            There's Barney Pince, wid his heart so true;
                            And the Andrews Brothers they'll go too!
                        
                        "Hold on, Tommy!" chipped in one of the Andrews; "you must give 'the
                            Andrews Brothers' a better advertisement than that! Turn us on a full
                            verse, can't you?"
                        "Make 'em pay for it if you do!" said the Major in an undertone. And
                            Tommy promptly amended:
                        
                            O, the Andrews Brothers, they'll be there,
                            Wid good se-gyars and wine to shpare
                            They'll treat us here on fine champagne,
                            And when we're there they'll treat again.
                        
                        The applause here was vociferous, and only discontinued when a box of
                            Havanas stood open upon the table. During the momentary lull thus
                            occasioned, I caught the Major's twinkling eyes glancing evasively
                            toward me, as he leant whispering  some
                            further instructions to Tommy, who again took up his desultory ballad,
                            while I arose and fled for the street, catching, however, as I went, and
                            high above the laughter of the crowd, the satire of this quatrain to its
                            latest line:
                        
                            But R-R-Riley he'll not go, I guess,
                            Lest he'd get lost in the wil-der-ness,
                            And so in the city he will shtop
                            For to curl his hair in the barber shop.
                        
                        It was after 6 when I reached the hotel, but I had my hair trimmed before
                            I went down to supper. The style of trimming I adopted then I still
                            adhere to, and call it " the Tommy Stafford stubble crop."
                        Ten days passed before I again saw the Major. Immediately upon his
                            returnit was late afternoon when I heard of itI determined to take my
                            evening walk out the long street toward his pleasant home and call upon
                            him there. This I did, and found him, in a wholesome state of fatigue,
                            slippers and easy chair, enjoying his pipe on the piazza. Of course he
                            was overflowing with happy reminiscences of the hunt the wood
                            -and-water-craft boats ambushesdecoys, and tramp and camp and so on,
                            without end:but I wanted to hear him talk of "The Wild Irishman "Tommy;
                            and I think, too, now, that the sagacious Major secretly read  my desires all the time. To be utterly
                            frank with the reader I will admit that I not only think that the Major
                            divined my interest in Tommy, but I know he did, for at last, as though
                            reading my very thoughts, he abruptly said, after a long pause, in which
                            he knocked the ashes from his pipe and refilled and lighted it: "Well,
                            all I know of 'The Wild Irishman' I can tell you in a very few wordsthat
                            is, if you care at all to listen?" And the crafty old Major seemed to
                            hesitate.
                        "Go ongo on! "I said, eagerly.
                        "About forty years ago," resumed the Major, placidly, "in the little,
                            old, unheard-of town of Karnteel, County Tyrone, Province Ulster,
                            Ireland, Tommy Staffordin spite of the contrary opinion of his
                            wretchedly poor parentswas fortunate enough to be born. And here again,
                            as I advised you the other day, you must be prepared for constant
                            surprises in the study of Tommy's character."
                        "Go on," I said; "I'm prepared for any-thing."
                        The Major smiled profoundly and continued:
                        "Fifteen years ago, when he came to Americaand the Lord only knows how he
                            got the passage-moneyhe brought his widowed mother  with him here, and has supported, and is still supporting
                            her. Besides," went on the still secretly smiling Major, " the fellow
                            has actually found time, through all his adversities, to pick up quite a
                            smattering of education, here and there"
                        "Poor fellow!" I broke in, sympathizingly, " what a pity it is that he
                            couldn't have had such advantages earlier in life," and as I recalled
                            the broad brogue of the fellow, together with his careless dress,
                            recognizing beneath it all the native talent and brilliancy of a mind of
                            most uncommon worth, I could not restrain a deep sigh of compassion and
                            regret.
                        The Major was leaning forward in the gathering dusk, and evidently
                            studying my own face, the expression of which, at that moment, was very
                            grave and solemn, I am sure. He suddenly threw himself backward in his
                            chair, in an uncontrollable burst of laughter. "Oh, I just can't keep it
                            up any longer!" he exclaimed.
                        "Keep what up?" I queried, in a perfect maze of bewilderment and
                            surprise: "Keep what up? "I repeated.
                        "Why, all this twaddle, farce, travesty and by-play regarding Tommy! You
                            know I warned you over and over, and you musn't blame me for the
                            deception. I never thought you'd take it so  in earnest!" and here the jovial Major again went into convulsions of
                            laughter.
                        "But I don't understand a word of it at all," I cried, half-frenzied with
                            the gnarl and tangle of the whole affair. "' What 'twaddle, farce and
                            travesty,' is it anyhow?" And in my vexation I found myself on my feet,
                            and striding nervously up and down the paved walk that joined the street
                            with the piazza, pausing at last and confronting the Major most
                            savagely. "Please explain," I said, controlling myself with an
                            effort.
                        The Major arose, "Your striding up and down there reminds me that a
                            little stroll on the street might do us both good," he said. "Will you
                            wait till I get a coat and hat?"
                        He rejoined me a moment later, and we passed through the open gate; and
                            saying, "Let's go down this way," he took my arm and turned into a
                            street where, cooling as the dusk was, the thick maples lining the walk
                            seemed to throw a special shade of tranquility upon us.
                        "What I meant was "began the Major, in a low, serious voice,"What I meant
                            wassimply this: Our friend Tommy, though the truest Irishman in the
                            world, is a man quite the opposite every way of the character he
                            appeared to you. All that rich brogue of his is assumed.  Though poor, as I told you, when he came
                            here, his native quickness, and his marvelous resources tact, judgment,
                            business qualitiesall have helped him to the equivalent of a liberal
                            education. His love of the humorous and the ridiculous is unbounded; but
                            he has serious moments as well, and at such times is as dignified and
                            refined in speech and manner as any man you'd find in a thousand. He is
                            a good speaker, can stir a political convention to fomentation when he
                            gets fired up; and can write an article for the press that goes to the
                            spot. He gets into a good many personal encounters of a rather
                            undignified character; but they are almost invariably bred of his innate
                            interest in the 'underdog,' and the fire-and-tow of his impetuous
                            nature."
                        My companion had paused here, and was looking through some printed slips
                            in his pocket-book. "I wanted you to see some of the fellow's articles
                            in print, but I have nothing of importance hereonly some of his
                            'doggeral,' as he calls it, and you've had a sample of that. But there's
                            a bit of his native dialect you should hear him recite. You may keep
                            that if you care to. The boys all fell in love with it, hearing his
                            rendition of it, and wanted copies. So we had a lot printed, and I have
                            two or three left. Put it in your pocket and read it at your
                            leisure."
                        
                        But I read it there and then, as eagerly, too, as I append it here and
                            now. It is called
                        
                            THE TOWN KARNTEEL.
                            The town Karnteelit's who'll reveal
                            Its praises justifiable?
                            For who can sing of anything
                            As lovely and reliable?
                            Where summer, spring, or winter lies,
                            From Malin's Head to Tipperary,
                            There's no such town for interprise
                            Bechuxt Youghal and Londonderry!
                        
                        
                            There's not its likes in Ireland
                            For twicet the week, be-gorries,

                            And racing wid phweel-borries!
                        
                        
                        
                            And whilst I feel for old Karnteel
                            That I've no phrases glorious, It stands above the
                                need of love
                            That boasts in voice uproarious.
                            Lave that for Cork, and Dublin too,
                            And Armagh and Killarney, thin,
                            And Karnteel won't be troublin' yo

                            Ah! there's the town of all the land,
                            For twicet the week, be-gorries,
                            They're playing jigs upon the band
                            And jumping there in sacksandand
                            And racing wid phweel-borries.
                        
                        "Before we turn back, now," said the smiling Major, as I stood lingering
                            over the indefinable humor of the last refrain, "before we turn back I
                            want to show you something eminently characteristic. Come this way a
                            half dozen steps."
                        As he spoke I looked up, to observe that we had paused before a handsome
                            square brick residence, centering a beautiful smooth lawn, its emerald
                            only littered with the light gold of the earliest autumn leaves. On
                            either side of the trim walk that led up from the gate to the curved
                            stone balusters of the broad piazza, with its empty easy chairs, were
                            graceful vases, frothing over with late blossoms, and wreathed with
                            laurel looking vines; and, luxuriantly lacing the border  of the pave that turned the further
                            corner of the house, blue, white and crimson, pink, and violet, went
                            fading in perspective as my gaze followed the gesture of the
                            Major's.
                        "Here, come a little further. Now you can see him, can't you?"
                        Yes, I could make out a figure in the deepening duskthe figure of a man
                            on the back stoop a tired-looking man, in his shirt-sleeves, that sat
                            upon a low chairno, not a chairan empty box. He was leaning forward with
                            his elbows resting on his knees, and the hands dropped limp. He was
                            smoking, too; I could barely see his pipe, and but for the odor of very
                            strong tobacco would not have known he had a pipe. Why does the master
                            of the house permit his servants to so desecrate this beautiful home? I
                            thought.
                        "Well, shall we go now?" said the Major.
                        I turned silently and we retraced our steps. I think neither of us spoke
                            for the distance of a square.
                        "Guess you didn't know the man there on the back porch?" said the
                            Major.
                        "No; why?" I asked dubiously.
                        "I hardly thought you would, and besides the poor fellow's tired, and it
                            was best not to disturb him," said the Major.
                        "Why, who was itsome one I know?"
                        
                        "It was Tommy."
                        "Oh," said I, queryingly. "He's employed there in some capacity?"
                        "Yes, as master of the house."
                        "You don't mean it?"
                        "I certainly do. He owns it, and made every cent of the money that paid
                            for it!" said the Major proudly. That's why I wanted you particularly to
                            note that 'eminent characteristic' I spoke of. Tommy could just as well
                            be sitting, with a fine cigar, on the front piazza in an easy chair, as
                            with his dhudeen, on the back porch, on an empty box, where every night
                            you'll find him. It's the unconscious dropping back into the old ways of
                            his father, and his father's father, and his father's father's father.
                            In brief, he sits there the poor lorn symbol of the long oppression of
                            his race.
                    
                    
                    
                        MRS. MILLER.
                        JOHN B. McKINNEY, attorney and
                            counselor at-law, as his sign read, was, for many reasons, a fortunate
                            man, and for many other reasons he was not. He was chiefly fortunate in
                            being, as certain opponents often strove to witheringly designate him,
                            "the son of his father," since that sound old gentleman was the
                            wealthiest farmer in that section, with but one son and heir to, in
                            time, supplant him in the role of "county god," and haply perpetuate the
                            prouder title of "the biggest tax-payer on the assessment list." And
                            this fact, too, fortunate as it would seem, was doubtless the indirect
                            occasion of a liberal percentage of all John's misfortunes. From his
                            earliest schooldays in the little town, up to his tardy graduation from
                            a distant college, the influence of his father's wealth invited his
                            procrastination, humored its results, encouraged the laxity of his
                            ambition, "and even now," as John used, in bitter irony, to put it, "it
                            is aiding and abetting me in the ostensible practice of my chosen
                            profession, a listless, aimless, undetermined man of forty, and a
                            confirmed bachelor at that!" At the utterance of this self-depreciating
                            statement, John 
                            
                                "HERE," HE
                                        "IS MY BEST FRIEND IN THE WORLD" Page 210.
                            
                             generally jerked his legs down from the
                            top of his desk; and, rising and kicking his chair back to the wall, he
                            would stump around his littered office till the manilla carpet steamed
                            with dust. Then he would wildly break away, seeking refuge either in the
                            open street or his room at the old- time tavern, the Eagle House,
                            "where," he would say, "I have lodged and boarded, I do solemnly
                            asseverate, for a long, unbroken, middle-aged eternity of ten years, and
                            can yet assert, in the words of the more fortunately-dying Webster, that
                            'I still live!'"
                        Extravagantly satirical as he was at times, John had always an
                            indefinable drollery about him that made him agreeable company to his
                            friends, at least; and such an admiring friend he had constantly at hand
                            in the person of Bert Haines. Both were Bohemians in natural tendency,
                            and, though John was far in Bert's advance in point of age, he found the
                            young man "just the kind of a fellow to have around." And so it was,
                            when summer days were dull and tedious, these two could muse and doze,
                            the hours away together; and when the nights were long, and dark, and
                            deep, and beautiful, they could drift out in the noon-light of the
                            stars, and with "the soft complaining flute" and "warbling lute," "lay
                            the pipes," as John would say, "for  our
                            enduring popularity with the girls!" And it was immediately subsequent
                            to one of these romantic excursions, when the belated pair, at 2 o'clock
                            in the morning, had skulked up a side stairway of the old hotel, and
                            gained John's room, with nothing more serious happening than Bert's
                            falling over a trunk and smashing his guitar,just after such a night of
                            romance and adventure it was that, in the seclusion of John's room, Bert
                            had something of especial import to communicate.
                        "Mack," he said, as that worthy anathe- matized a spiteful match, and
                            then sucked his finger.
                        "Blast the all-fired old torch!" said John, wrestling with the lamp-flue,
                            and turning on a welcome flame at last. "Well, you said 'Mack!' Why
                            don't you go on? And don't bawl at top of your lungs, either. You've
                            already succeeded in waking every boarder in the house with that guitar,
                            and you want to make amends now, by letting them go to sleep again!"
                        "But my dear fellow," said Bert, with forced calmness, "you're the fellow
                            that's making all the noiseand"
                        "Why, you howling dervish!" interrupted John, with a feigned air of
                            pleased surprise and admiration. "But let's drop controversy. Throw  the fragments of your guitar in the
                            wood-box there, and proceed with the opening proposition."
                        "What I was going to say was this," said Bert, with a half-desperate
                            enunciation; "I'm getting tired of this way of livingclean, dead-tired,
                            and fagged out, and sick of the whole artificial business!"
                        "Oh, yes!" exclaimed John, with a towering disdain, "you needn't go any
                            further! I know just what malady is throttling you. Its reformreform!
                            You're going to 'turn over a new leaf,' and all that, and sign the
                            pledge, and quit cigars, and go to work, and pay your debts, and
                            graviate back into Sunday-school, where you can make love to the
                            preacher's daughter under the guise of religion, and desecrate the
                            sanctity of the innermost pale of the church by confessions at class of
                            your 'thorough conversion!' Oh, you're going to"
                        "No, but I'm going to do nothing of the sort," said Bert resentfully.
                            "What I meanif you'll let me finishis, I'm getting too old to be
                            eternally undignifying myself with this 'singing of midnight strains
                            under Bonnybell's window-panes,' and too old to be keeping myself in
                            constant humiliation and expense by the borrowing and stringing up of
                            old guitars, together with  the breakage
                            of the same, and the general wear-and-tear on a constitution that is
                            slowly being sapped to its foundations by exposure in the night air and
                            the dew." "And while you receive no further compensation in return,"
                            said John, "than, perhaps, the coy turning-up of a lamp at an upper
                            casement where the jasmine climbs, or an exasperating patter of
                            invisible palms, or a huge dank wedge of fruit-cake shoved at you by the
                            old man, through a crack in the door."
                        "Yes, and I'm going to have my just reward, is what I mean," said Bert;
                            "and exchange the lover's life for the benedict's. Going to hunt out a
                            good sensible girl and marry her." And as the young man concluded this
                            desperate avowal he jerked the bow of his cravat into a hard knot,
                            kicked his hat under the bed, and threw himself on the sofa like an old
                            suit.
                        John stared at him with absolute compassion. "Poor devil," he said, half
                            musingly, "I know just how he feels
                        
                            Ring in the wind his wedding chimes;
                            Smile, villagers, at every door;
                            Old churchyards stuffed with buried crimes,
                            Be clad in sunshine o'er and o'er,
                            And youthful maidens, white and sweet,
                            Scatter your blossoms far and wide,
                            And with a bridal-chorus greet
                            This happy bridegroom and his bride!"
                        
                        
                        "Oh, here!" exclaimed the wretched Bert, jumping to his feet; "let up on
                            that dismal recitative. It would make a dog howl to hear that."
                        " Then you 'let up' on that suicidal talk of marrying," replied John,
                            "and all that harangue of incoherency about your growing old. Why, my
                            dear fellow, you're at least a dozen years my junior, and look at me!"
                            And John glanced at himself in the glass with a feeble pride, noting the
                            gray sparseness of his side-hair, and its plaintive dearth on top. "Of
                            course I've got to admit," he continued, "that my hair is gradually
                            evaporating; but for all that, I'm 'still in the ring,' don't you know;
                            as young in society, for the matter of that, as yourself! And this is
                            just the reason why I don't want you to blight every prospect in your
                            life by marrying at your ageespecially a womanI mean the kind of woman
                            you'd be sure to fancy at your age."
                        "Didn't I say 'a good, sensible girl' was the kind I had selected? "Bert
                            remonstrated.
                        "Oh!" exclaimed John, "you've selected her then? And without one word to
                            me!" he ended rebukingly.
                        "Well, hang it all!" said Bert, impatiently; "I knew how you were, and
                            just how you'd  talk me out of it, and I
                            made up my mind that for once, at least, I'd follow the dictates of a
                            heart thathowever malleable in youthful frivolitiesshould beat in
                            manhood loyal to itself and loyal to its own affinity."
                        "Go it! Fire away! Farewell, vain world!" exclaimed the excited John.
                            "Trade your soul off for a pair of ear bobs and a button hooka hank of
                            jute hair and a box of lily-white! I've buried not less than ten old
                            chums this way, and here's another nominated for the tomb! How dare I
                            ever trust again in transitory man!"
                        It was a bright morning when the slothful John was aroused by a long,
                            vociferous pounding on the door. He started up in bed to find himself
                            alonethe victim of his wrathful irony having evidently risen and fled
                            away while his pitiless tormentor slept" Doubtless to at once accomplish
                            that nefarious intent as set forth by his unblushing confession of last
                            night," mused the miserable John, and he ground his fingers in the
                            corners of his swollen eyes, and leered grimly at the feverish orbs,
                            blood-shotten, blurred and aching.
                        The pounding on the door continued. John looked at his watch; it was only
                            8 o'clock.
                        "Hi, there!" he called viciously. "What do you mean, anyhow?" he went on,
                            elevating  his voice again; "shaking a man
                            out of bed when he's just dropping into his first sleep?"
                        "I mean that you're going to get up; that's what!" replied a firm female
                            voice. "It's 8 o'clock, and I want to put your room in order, and I'm
                            not going to wait all day about it, either! Get up and go down to your
                            breakfast, and let me have the room!" And the clamor at the door was
                            industriously renewed.
                        "Say!" called John, querulously, hurrying on his clothes, "Say, you!"
                        "There's no say about it!" responded the determined voice; "I've heard
                            about you, and your ways around this house, and I'm not going to put up
                            with it! You'll not lie in bed till high noon when I've got to keep your
                            room in proper order!"
                        "Oh, ho!" said John, "reckon you're the new invasion here? Doubtless
                            you're the girl that's been hanging up the new window blinds that won't
                            roll, and disguising the pillows with clean slips, and 'hennin' around
                            among my books and papers on the table here, and ageing me generally
                            till I don't know my own handwriting by the time I find it. Oh, yes!
                            you're going to revolutionize things here; you're going to introduce
                            promptness, and system, and order. See you've even filled the
                            wash-pitcher and tucked two  starched
                            towels through the handle. Haven't got any tin towels, have you? I
                            rather like this new soap, too! So solid and durable, you know;
                            warranted not to raise a lather. Might as well wash one's hands with a
                            door knob! "And as John's voice grumbled away into the sullen silence
                            again, the determined voice without responded: "Oh, you can growl away
                            to your heart's content, Mr. McKinney, but I want you to distinctly
                            understand that I'm not going to humor you in any of your old bachelor
                            slug-gardly, slovenly ways, and whims and notions. And I want you to
                            understand, too, that I am not hired help in this house, nor a
                            chambermaid, nor anything of the kind. I'm the landlady here, and I'll
                            give you just five minutes more to get down to your breakfast, or you'll
                            not get any that's what!" And as the reversed cuff he was in the act of
                            buttoning slid from John's wrist and rolled under the dresser, he heard
                            a stiff rustling of starched muslin flouncing past the door, and the
                            quick italicized patter of determined gaiters down the hall.
                        "Look here," said John, to the bright-faced boy in the hotel office, a
                            half hour, later "It seems the house here's been changing hands
                            again."
                        "Yes, sir," said the boy, closing the cigar  case, and handing him a lighted match. "Well, the new landlord,
                            whoever he is," continued John, patronizingly, "is 'a good one.'
                            Leastwise, he knows what's good to eat, and how to serve it."
                        The boy laughed timidly," It ain't a 'landlord,' thoughit's a landlady;
                            it's my mother."
                        "Ah," said John, dallying with the change the boy had pushed toward him.
                            " Your mother, eh? And where's your father?"
                        "He's dead," said the boy.
                        "And what's this for?" abruptly asked John, examining his change.
                        "That's your change," said the boy. "You got three for a quarter, and
                            gave me a 'half.'"
                        "Well, you just keep it," said John, sliding back the change. "It's for
                            good luck, you know, my boy. Same as drinking you long life and
                            prosperity. And Oh, yes, by the way, you may tell your mother I'll have
                            a friend to dinner with me to-day."
                        "Yes, sir, and thank you, sir," said the beaming boy.
                        "Handsome boy," mused John, as he walked down street. "Takes that from
                            his father, though, I'll wager my existence."
                        Upon his office desk, John found a hastily written note. It was addressed
                            in the wellknown  hand of his old chum. He
                            eyed the missive apprehensively, and there was a positive pathos in his
                            voice as he said aloud; "It's our divorce, I feel it!" The note, headed
                            "At the office, 4 in morning," ran like this: 
                                
                                    
                                        DEAR MACK
                                        
                                        I left you slumbering so soundly that, by noon, when you
                                            waken, I hope, in your refreshed state, you will look
                                            more tolerantly on my intentions as confided to you this
                                            night. I will not see you here again to say good-bye. I
                                            wanted to, but was afraid to "rouse the sleeping lion."
                                            I will not close my eyes to-night fact is I haven't
                                            time. Our serenade at Josie's was a prearranged signal
                                            by which she is to be ready and at the station for the 5
                                            morning train. You may remember the lighting of three
                                            consecutive matches at her window before the igniting of
                                            her lamp. That meant, "Thrice, dearest one, I'll meet
                                            thee at the depot at 4:30 sharp." So, my dear Mack, this
                                            is to inform you that, even as you read, Josie and I
                                            have eloped. It is all the old man's fault, yet I
                                            forgive him. Hope he'll return the favor. Josie predicts
                                            he will inside of a weekor ten days, anyhow. Good-bye,
                                            Mack, old boy, and let a fellow down as easy as you
                                            can.
                                        Affectionately, BERT.
                                            
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        "Heavens!" exclaimed John, stifling the note in his hand and stalking
                            tragically around the room. "Can it be possible that I have nursed a
                            frozen viper? An ingrate? A wolf in sheep's clothing? An ourang-outang
                            in gent's furnishings?"
                        
                        "Was you callin' me, sir?" asked a voice at the door. It was the
                            janitor.
                        "No!" thundered John; "quit my sight! get out of my way! No, no,
                            Thompson, I don't mean that," he called after him. "Here's a half dollar
                            for you, and I want you to lock up the office, and tell anybody that
                            wants to see me that I've been set upon, and sacked and assassinated in
                            cold blood, and I've fled to my father's in the country, and am lying
                            there in the convulsions of dissolution, babbling of green fields and
                            running brooks, and thirsting for the life of every woman that comes in
                            gun-shot!" And then, more like a confirmed invalid than a man in the
                            strength and pride of his prime, he crept down into the street again,
                            and thence back to his hotel.
                        Dejectedly climbing to his room, he encountered on the landing above a
                            little woman in a jaunty dusting-cap and a trim habit of crisp muslin.
                            He tried to evade her, but in vain. She looked him squarely in the
                            face.
                        "You' re the gentleman in No. 11, I believe?" she said.
                        He nodded confusedly.
                        "Mr. McKinney is your name, I think?" she queried, with a pretty
                            elevation of the eyebrows.
                        "Yes, ma'am," said John rather abjectly. "You see, ma'ambut I beg
                            pardon," he went  on stammeringly, and
                            with a very awkward bow "I beg pardon, but I am addressingah
                            theahthe"
                        "You are addressing the new landlady," she interpolated, pleasantly.
                            "Mrs. Miller is my name. I think we should be friends, Mr. McKinney,
                            since I hear you are one of the oldest patrons of the house."
                        "Thank youthank you!" said John, completely embarrassed. "Yes, indeed!ha,
                            ha. Oh, yesyesreally we must be quite old friends, I assure you,
                            Mrs.Mrs."
                        "Mrs. Miller," smilingly prompted the little woman.
                        "Yes, ah, yes,Mrs. Miller. Lovely morning, Mrs. Miller," said John,
                            edging past her and backing toward his room.
                        But as Mrs. Miller was laughing outright, for some mysterious reason, and
                            gave no affirmative in response to his proposition as to the quality of
                            the weather, John, utterly abashed and nonplused, darted into his room
                            and closed the door.
                        "Deucedly extraordinary woman!" he thought; "wonder what's her idea!"
                        He remained locked in his room till dinner, and when he promptly emerged
                            for that occasion there was a very noticeable improvement in his
                            personal appearance, in point of dress at least, for  there still lingered about his smoothly
                            shaven features a certain haggard, care-worn, anxious look.
                        Next his own place at the table he found a chair tilted forward, as
                            though in reservation for some honored guest. What did it mean? Oh, he
                            remembered now. Told the boy to tell his mother he would have a friend
                            to dine with him. Bert,and, blast the fellow! he was doubtless dining
                            then with a far preferable companionhis wifein a palace car on the P.,
                            C. & St. L., two hundred miles away. The thought was maddening.
                            Of course, now, the landlady would have material for a new assault. And
                            how could he avert it? Dare he meet it? A despairing film blurred his
                            sight for the momentthen the eyes flashed daringly. "I will meet it like
                            a man!" he said mentally" yes, I will invite it! Let her do her
                            worst!"
                        He called a servant, directing some message in an undertone.
                        "Yes, sir," said the agreeable servant, "I'll go right away, sir," and he
                            left the room.
                        Five minutes elapsed, and then a voice at his elbow startled him:
                        "Did you send for me, Mr, McKinney? What is it I can do?"
                        "You are very kind, Mrs.Mrs."
                        
                        "Mrs. Miller," said the landlady, with a smile that he remembered.
                        "Now, please spare me even the mildest of rebukes. I deserve your
                            censure, but I can't stand itI can't, positively!" and there was a
                            pleading look in John's lifted eyes that changed the little woman's
                            smile to an expression of real solicitude. "I have sent for you,"
                            continued John, "to ask of you three great favors. Please be seated
                            while I enumerate them. FirstI want you to forgive and forget that
                            ill-natured, uncalled-for grumbling of mine this morning when you
                            wakened me."
                        "Why, certainly," said the landlady, again smiling, though quite
                            seriously.
                        "I thank you," said John, with dignity. "And, second," he continued"I
                            want your assurance that my extreme confusion and awkwardness on the
                            occasion of our meeting later were rightly interpreted."
                        "Certainlycertainly," said the landlady, with the kindliest sympathy.
                        "I am gratefulutterly," said John, with newer dignity. "And then," he
                            went on "after informing you that it is impossible for the best friend I
                            have in the world to be with me at this hour, as intended, I want you to
                            do me the very great honor of dining with me. Will you?"
                        
                        "Why, certainly," said the charming little landlady" and a thousand
                            thanks beside! But tell me something of your friend," she continued, as
                            they were being served: "What is he like and what is his nameand where
                            is he?"
                        "Well," said John, warily" he's like all young fellows of his age. He's
                            quite young, you knownot over thirty, I should saya mere boy, in fact,
                            but clevertalentedversatile."
                        "Unmarried, of course," said the chatty little woman.
                        "Oh, yes," said John, in a matter-of-course tonebut he caught himself
                            abruptly then stared intently at his napkinglanced evasively at the
                            side-face of his questioner, and said," Oh, yes! Yes, indeed! He's
                            unmarried. Old bachelor like myself, you know. Ha! ha!"
                        "So he's not like the young man here that distinguished himself last
                            night?" says the little woman, archly.
                        The fork in John's hand, half-lifted to his lips, faltered, and fell back
                            toward his plate.
                        "Why, what's that?" said John, in a strange voice; "I haven't heard
                            anything about itI mean I haven't heard anything about any young man.
                            What was it?"
                        "Haven't heard anything about the elopement?" exclaimed the little woman
                            in astonishment.  "Why, it's been the talk
                            of the town all morning. Elopement in high lifeson of a grain dealer,
                            name of Hines, or Himes or something, and a preacher's daughterJosie
                            somebody didn't catch her last name. Wonder if you don't know the
                            partiesWhy, Mr. McKinney, are you ill?"
                        "Oh, nonot at all!" said John: "Don't mention it. Haha! Just eating too
                            rapidly, that's all. Go on withyou were saying that Bert and Josie had
                            really eloped."
                        "What Bert?" asked the little woman quickly.
                        "Why, did I say Bert?" says John, with a guilty look. "I meant Haines, of
                            course, you knowHaines and Josie. And did they really elope?"
                        "That's the report," answered the little woman as though deliberating
                            some important evidence; "and they say, too, that the plot of the
                            runaway was quite ingenious. It seems the young lovers were assisted in
                            their flight by some old fellowfriend of the young man'sWhy, Mr.
                            McKinney, you are ill, surely!"
                        John's face was ashen.
                        "Nono!" he gasped painfully: "Go on go on! Tell me more about thethethe
                            old  fellowthe old reprobate! And is he
                            still at large?"
                        "Yes," said the little woman, anxiously regarding the strange demeanor of
                            her companion. "They say, though, that the law can do nothing with him,
                            and that this fact only intensifies the agony of the broken-hearted
                            parentsfor it seems they have, till now, regarded him both as a
                            gentleman and family friend in whom "
                        "I really am ill," moaned John, waveringly rising to his feet; "but I beg
                            you not to be alarmed. Tell your little boy to come to my room, where I
                            will retire at once and send for my physician. It is simply a nervous
                            attack. I am often troubled so, and only perfect quiet and seclusion
                            restores me. You have done me a great honor, Mrs.""Mrs. Miller," sighed
                            the sympathetic little woman" Mrs. Miller,and I thank you more than I
                            have words to express." He bowed limply, turned through a side door
                            opening on a stair, and tottered to his room.
                        During the three weeks of illness through which he passed, John had every
                            attentionmuch more, indeed, than he had consciousness to appreciate. For
                            the most part his mind wandered, and he talked of curious things, and
                                 laughed hysterically, and serenaded
                            mermaids that dwelt in grassy seas of dew, and were bald-headed like
                            himself. He played upon a fourteen-jointed flute of solid gold, with
                            diamond holes, and keys carved out of thawless ice. His old father came
                            at first to take him home; but he could not be moved, the doctor
                            said.
                        Two weeks of John's illness had worn away, when a very serious looking
                            young man, in a travelling duster, and a high hat, came up the stairs to
                            see him. A handsome young lady was clinging to his arm. It was Bert and
                            Josie. She had guessed the very date of their forgiveness. John wakened
                            even clearer in mind than usual that afternoon. He recognized his old
                            chum at a glance, and Josienow Bert's wife. Yes, he comprehended that.
                            He was holding a hand of each when another figure entered. His thin,
                            white fingers loosened their clasp, and he held a hand toward the
                            newcomer. "Here," he said, "is my best friend in the worldBert, you and
                            Josie will love her, I know; for this is Mrs. Mrs.""Mrs. Miller," said
                            the radiant little woman."Yes, Mrs. Miller," said John, very
                            proudly.
