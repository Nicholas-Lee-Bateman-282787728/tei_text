                     In Its Relation to French Colonial Policy
            By PAUL C. PHILLIPS Professor of History, University of 
                        Montana
                    
            
            The opening of the eighteenth century marked the beginning of the struggle between the English and
                    the French for control of the Mississippi valley. The French had extended their
                    posts the whole length of the river, but the English were threatening their hold by advancing upon
                    the headwaters of the great rivers flowing westward from the Alleghanies. The Carolinians had
                    descended the 
                        Tennessee
                     to its southern most bend and had then journeyed down the 
                        Alabama
                     to the gulf. They had supplied the Chickasaws with arms and thus won their friendship
                    and together these red-men and whites had enslaved other Indians who still had to rely upon their
                    native weapons.1
            
            Farther to the north the English were moving down the 
                        Ohio
                    . In 1700 traders from Carolina and 
                        Virginia
                    , apparently by way of the 
                        Cumberland
                     (Quas quem), had reached the 
                        Mississippi
                     and established themselves among the 
                        Arkansas
                     Indians at Cappa near the mouth of the St. Frances river.
                    Iberville declared that these men were operating under orders

                     1 Iberville wrote shortly after 1700 concerning the English:
                            "II y a plusiers années qu'ils se sont placés aux
                            Chicacha qu'ils ont armez de fusils ausquels ils se joignent et font des courses
                            sur les autres nations qu'ils font esclaves." Several years ago they
                            joined (?) the Chickasaws whom they armed with guns, with whom they joined and made
                            incursions on the other nations which they enslaved. He added that the English had gone
                            north to the thirty-seventh parallel and south to the thirty-third and descended the Mobile [

                            congress. This memorial by Iberville is typical of many in the French archives.
               
                     from English governors and he believed that their coming was
                    the forerunner of larger movements of the English from across the mountains.2 In
                    the English colonies, he argued, population was already so dense that it must find an outlet to the
                    west. The newcomers would naturally settle along the 
                        Ohio
                     and ally themselves with the Indians whose lands they were invading.3 If this should take place, the English would be in a position to cut the communication
                    between 
                        Louisiana
                     and 
                        Canada
                     and threaten the integrity of the French colonial empire.
            Iberville furthermore pointed out that the coureurs du bois, who had come down to
                    the 
                        Ohio
                     from 
                        Canada
                     to trade, were already selling their furs to the English, whose posts were only three
                    or four hundred leagues away and could be reached without portage. To break up this trade, Iberville
                    proposed drastic measures. At one time he suggested closing all the routes leading from the 
                        Ohio
                     country to the English posts.4 At another time he proposed to send
                    an army to destroy the English colonies and thus end their encroachments.5 He
                    would then establish a post on the "Ouabache" and compel the Indians to trade
                    there or go to 
                        Detroit
                    .
            Iberville planned this post to check the advances of the French Canadians as well as those of the
                    English. He regarded 
                  
                     2 "C'est par la Branche de quasquens que sont
                            descendus plusieurs anglois de la Caroline en Virginle qui sont venus S'establir
                            aux Acansa ou Cappa—-Les anglois qui sont venus S'establir aux Acansa au
                            mols de Mars 1700, estoient venus de la Caroline par la Riviere de Ouabache avec un ordre
                            pour S'establir sur les bords du Mississippy comme estant un pays de la dependance
                            de l'Angleterre." Ibid. It is by a branch of the 
                                Cumberland
                             that several English came down from Carolina into 
                                Virginia
                             who came to settle at the Acansa or Cappa. The English who came to settle at
                            the Acansa in the month of March 1700, came from Carolina by the Wabash
                            River with an order to settle on the banks of the 
                                Mississippi
                            , as being a country of English dependence.
                  
                     3 Iberville wrote that the English "se joignent a plusieurs
                            Nations d'Indiens comme les quasquens Chaoiienons et Loups qui Se Sont establys sur
                            une des branches de la Rivlee Ouabache —— Ibid. The
                            English joined with several tribes of Indians, like the Chaouenons and Loups who were
                            settled on one of the branches of the Wabash river. Dunn, J. P. Indiana, (1905) Ch. II. gives an excellent summary of English plans to
                            gain possession of the western trade.

                     5 Iberville proposed an army "assez forte pour destrulre les
                            establissements de la Virginie, Meriland, et Pensillevania." Ibid. C 13; C 2; 47. An army strong enough to destroy the settlements of
                                    
                        Virginia, Maryland
                     , and 
                                Pennsylvania
                            . (Although this memorial is dated 1702, it speaks of the trade of 
                                Detroit
                            , P. 47.)
               
                     the 
                        Wabash
                     country as a part of 
                        Louisiana
                    ; yet Canadian merchants were already laying claim to its trade.6
                    They were vigorously supported by Frontenac who sought to secure a firm hold in the country by
                    sending the elder 
                        Vincennes
                     to establish a post among the Miami Indians.7
            
            Iberville's urgings apparently received no consideration and nothing was done for nearly a
                    quarter of a century. Frenchmen of 
                        Louisiana
                     were to write memorials in regard to the coveted country while Canadians and English
                    were fighting for its possession. Iberville had known that the country was rich in furs, and he
                    thought that tanneries there would prove profitable. He thought also that lead mines could be worked
                    to advantage.8
            
            There are other descriptions of the country in the years following 1700 still more attractive than
                    Iberville's. One writer added to the unlimited supply of furs and to the wealthy mines an
                    extremely fertile soil. He described the woods as full of wild apples from which could be made
                    excellent cider.9 He too feared that the English would seek to obtain the
                    country and urged the construction of a post to bar them from descending the rivers. Yet another
                    writer urged that a post on the "Ouabache" would be valuable for supplying the
                    other posts of 
                        Louisiana
                     with provisions.10 In 1708 appeared a Memoir sur
                        L'establissement d'une Compagnie de Commerce a la Louisiane,11
                which advocated the establishment of a post there as necessary to defend the
                    commerce of the Mississippi Valley from the advance of the 
                  
                     6 fermiers du castor de Canadas ont demandé par leurs
                            memoires de 1701 de rendre les limidri Canadas à Ouabache et d'y faire
                            un establissement pour empescher le commerce de castor par là avec les Anglois

                                Ohio

                     English. In 1709 Mandeville described a trip on the 
                        Wabash
                     with the Sr. de Sucheraux who was interested in the fur trade.12 In
                    1718, F. le Maire made a most urgent plea for the fortification of the 
                        Ohio
                     in order to keep out the English and secure the trade for the French.13 Another memorialist declared that unless their ways were barred the English would gain
                    control of the 
                        Ohio
                     and all of its tributaries. They could then build a fort at its mouth and extend their
                    influence to 
                        New Mexico
                    . To secure this rich country the writer urged a post near the mouth of the 
                        Ohio
                     and three missions, one of which should be at the junction of the 
                        Ohio
                     and the 
                        Wabash
                    .14 In 1720, the 
                        Mississippi
                     Company advised the

                            Memoire sur la Louisiane pour M. de Mandeville, 1709. Mandeville wrote
                            regarding the 
                                Wabash
                            , "ou j'estois avec le Sr de Sucheraux interessé

                            fort, and a considerable establishment in some one of its forks. That one, which forms the
                            river Casquinambeaux seems to me the best to fortify because from this place we can block
                            the road to the English. Moreover, other than fortifying a good post on this river, we can
                            place a protection against all the enterprises which the English can carry on (or make) on
                            the 
                                Mississippi
                            ,–or again by protecting ourselves by this means, the commerce of all
                            the nations of the east, which is of very great importance, and by the profit which the
                            French are drawing from it, and by the harm (or loss) which the English are suffering, if we
                            can take away from them this traffic which alone they wish more than all the others.

                            probably written in 1716, declares that to keep out the English "il faut

                            Miciscipi." The writer believes that unless this is done the English will build a
                            fort "à L'embouchure d'Ouabache, dont il sera

                    . Charlevoix also considered the 
                        Wabash
                     country of great importance.10
            
            In spite of all these urgings, there was not enough force in the various governments of 
                        Louisiana
                     to take advantage of the opportunities before them. Traders from 
                        Canada
                     were, however, early in the field with only the competition of the English to threaten
                    them.
            In 1712 the French of 
                        Canada
                     defeated the Foxes at 
                        Detroit
                     and soon after Governor Vaudreuil sent the elder 
                        Vincennes
                     to live among the Miamis in the 
                        Wabash
                     country. In 1715 this adventurer was in the neighborhood of the modern 
                        Fort Wayne
                     and making every effort to stop the trade of the Indians with the English.16 He apparently had some success and undoubtedly secured great influence among
                    the Mi-amis.17 About 1718, his son, a boy of eighteen years, joined him.18 This boy was to spend the remainder of his life in the 
                        Wabash
                     country and to found the post which the French of 
                        Louisiana
                     had been urging for years.

                  18 It is improbable that any copies of this correspondence were sent to
                        the French Colonial office and there can hardly be any other way of preserving it.
            
            
            In 1719 the father died and his influence with the Miamis descended in large measure to the son. The
                    young man rose in reputation, and some time after 1720 Boisbrilliant, the commander at the 
                        Illinois
                    , apparently sought his services for 
                        Louisiana
                    . The correspondence between them has probably been lost,19 but it
                    is likely that the energetic commander of Fort de Chartres was planning to carry through the
                    construction of the long-contemplated 
                        Wabash
                     post, and desired the help of 
                        Vincennes
                     in this undertaking. In 1724 Vaudreuil, the governor of 
                        Canada
                    , knew of Boisbrilliant's schemes and wrote him a letter of protest. He
                    declared that the 
                        Wabash
                     country in no way belonged to 
                        Louisiana
                     and objected to Boisbrilliant's efforts to draw 
                        Vincennes
                     away from the service of 
                        Canada
                    . He declared that if the efforts were continued he would appeal to the king.19
            
            This correspondence probably brought to a head the dispute over the 
                        Wabash
                     country which had been dragging along for a quarter of a century and had become acute
                    after the annexation of the 
                        Illinois
                     to 
                        Louisiana
                     in 1717.20 Vaudreuil claimed the 
                        Wabash
                     as a part of 
                        Canada
                     and its trade had hitherto gone by the Maumee to the St. Lawrence. The 
                        Wabash
                    , however, was naturally an outpost of the 
                        Illinois
                     country and was on the route by which the English were marching towards the 
                        Mississippi
                    .
            The Company of the Indies which had succeeded the 
                        Mississippi
                     Company in control of 
                        Louisiana
                    , hesitated to begin the fight for the territory in question. It was handicapped,
                    moreover, by lack of funds and in 1724 decided to reduce the post of 
                        Illinois
                     to eight men and to form no new posts.21 Boisbrilliant saw the
                    danger and informed the officials of the company that the English would win over the Indians unless
                    the French were quick to supply their needs.22 Boisbrilliant was probably acting
                    under instructions from his cousin, Bienville

                     governor of 
                        Louisiana
                    . Bienville had doubtless been carrying on a correspondence with the Company of the
                    Indies regarding the 
                        Wabash
                     post and apparently his recommendations were looked upon with favor. It appears that he
                    had already obtained sanction to start a post in this region, for in 1725 he wrote that he had
                    delayed its construction for fear of not having enough merchandise to carry on a trade with the
                    Indians. He declared at the same time that the small garrison maintained by Vaudreuil on the upper 
                        Wabash
                     (near 
                        Ft. Wayne
                    ) could not keep out the English who had free access to the 
                        Mississippi
                     by way of the Ohio, the Cumberland, and the
                        Tennessee rivers. He urged as a further reason for assistance in building
                    this post that there were a number of French families already settled on the 
                        Wabash
                     who needed protection.23 These settlers traded directly with the
                    natives while the English still had to carry on their commerce through the Iroquois tribes that
                    wintered on the upper 
                        Ohio
                    .24
            
            The urgings of Bienville and Boisbrilliant apparently brought the Company of the Indies to the point
                    of making 2 decision. In May, 1725, it asked the governor of 
                        New France

                        Wabash
                     country. It suggested the construction of new posts to preserve communication between 
                        Canada
                     and 
                        Louisiana
                    ! and one of these posts was to be placed on the 
                        Wabash

                            constructing one there. I have myself sent a plan to the company saying In it that I am very
                            anxious to build it because of the fear of not being able to carry on my enterprise for lack

                                Canada

                     to co-operate with 
                        Vincennes
                    , who was still in command among the Miamis, in an effort to exclude the English.26 It was probably due to the promptings of company officials that the king
                    shortly after this instructed the governor general of 
                        Canada
                     to order 
                        Vincennes
                     to act with Boisbrilliant for the same purpose.27
            
            Boisbrilliant apparently opened negotiations with 
                        Vincennes
                     at once. His efforts were hastened by the information that the Dutch from 
                        Albany
                     had established posts on the upper 
                        Ohio
                    , where they had built two mills "de Bates", a fort, and several store
                    houses, abundantly supplied with goods. Since the French were short of merchandise and what they had
                    was not of a kind to attract the Indians, Boisbrilliant feared that the newcomers would get most of
                    the trade.28 Bienville, however, urged that the fort be built, and recommended
                    that 
                        Vincennes
                     should command it.29
            
            Boisbrilliant's report regarding English activities probably stirred the Company of the
                    Indies to action. In September, 1726, a letter was sent by the company to Perier, who had succeeded
                    Bienville as governor of 
                        Louisiana
                    , stating that the 
                        Wabash
                     country was not yet occupied by any nation of Europe; but that if the English should
                    establish themselves on any of the great rivers of this country, they could not only threaten the 
                        Illinois
                     but could break communications between 
                        Louisiana
                     and 
                        Canada
                    . The company also gave orders to Perier to establish a post on the 
                        Wabash
                    , if this danger was still threatening; and asked the governor of 
                        Canada
                     to direct 
                        Vincennes
                    , who was still among the Miamis, to co-operate with the commander of the new post.30

                        report.
               
                  30"La Compagnie a ordonné l'Establissement
                        d'n poste sur la Rivière de Ouabache, et a prié M. Le Gouverneur
                        de Canada de donner ordre de son costé au Sr. de Vincennes Qui commande chez Les
                        Ouiatanons Miamis Etablis vers le haut de Ouabache de S'entendre avec le Commandant du
                        nouveau Poste." Ibid. The company has ordered the establishment of a
                        post on the Wabash River and has asked the Governor of 
                            Canada
                         to give the command of his poste to Mr. Vincennes who commands the Ouiatanons
                        Miamis established near the source of the 
                            Wabash
                        , to extend it with the commandant of the new post.
            
            
            The company even expressed its willingness, if the English were becoming too formidable, to build two
                    posts; one on the 
                        Wabash
                     and one on the 
                        Ohio
                    . The instructions to Perier, however, suggested that 
                        Vincennes
                     might be induced to enter their service for a gratuity of three hundred livres in
                    addition to his pay. The company ended the letter by expressing the hope that if the English did not
                    appear too dangerous and 
                        Vincennes
                     could be bought over, it might be spared the expense of building even one post. It
                    asked Perier to decide whether 
                        Vincennes
                     and his Miamis with the assistance of eight or ten soldiers, might not be counted upon
                    to hold the country.31
            
            Perier apparently acted quickly in seeking art understanding by which 
                        Vincennes
                     was to enter the service of 
                        Louisiana
                    . In October, 1727, the company approved an arrangement by which he was to receive three
                    hundred livres in addition to his salary.32
                    
                        Vincennes
                    , however, did not resign his Canadian commission immediately, for as late as October
                    15, 1729, he was still listed as an officer of 
                        New France
                    .33 The next year, however, the governor and intendant of 
                        Canada
                     wrote: "The Ouyatonons have been led into the government of 
                        Louisiana
                     by Sr. de Vincennes, who is entirely separated from this government."34
            
            The long delay before the new arrangement was fully understood may be explained by the slowness of
                    communication. The news that the company approved his salary could

                            l'Entretine de la garnison font un objet de Conséquence." Ibid. M. Perier will think over this affair carefully and see if on giving
                            eight or ten soldiers to 
                                Vincennes
                             with the Missionaire destined for the 
                                Wabash

                        Vincennes
                     before some time in the spring of 1728. In the fall of 1727 Perier, in accordance with
                    the company's suggestion, had sent goods to supply a post on the 
                        Wabash
                     and another on the 
                        Ohio
                    ,35 but the boat in which they were shipped was stopped by the ice
                    before it reached its destination and was compelled to return.36 Furthermore, in
                    the spring of 1728 
                        Vincennes
                     was taken seriously ill37 and was unable to undertake any work
                    until well into the summer.38
            
            On account of these delays the fort could not be started before the company had had time to lay down
                    full instructions. In October, 1727, the company complained to Perier and to de la Chaise, the
                    intendant of 
                        Louisiana
                    , that it had received no ‘recommendations regarding the site of the proposed
                    post. The communication then proceeded to discuss in detail the available locations, pointing out
                    that the purpose was to keep the English out of the 
                        Wabash
                     country and to keep open communication between 
                        Louisiana
                     and 
                        Canada
                    . In view of these purposes the writer declared that the post must not be located at the
                    junction of the "Ouabache" with the 
                        Mississippi
                    , nor at the mouth of the Casquinaubous (
                        Cumberland
                    ). Either of these locations would be too far down the river to attract the Miamis or
                    receive their support. If the Miamis could be persuaded to move from their homes to

                            Vincennes who was sick at the home of Sieur Petit de Levilliers has come down to his

                     the new post, continued the writer, the English would have no
                    one to oppose them on the upper 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Wabash
                     and could easily get possession of the country and its trade. Owing to these
                    considerations the company urged that the post should be established in the country of the Miamis.
                    It suggested further that 
                        Vincennes
                     should be under the direction of Desliettes who was then commander of the 
                        Illinois
                    .39
            
            The new post was to be manned by ten soldiers and two officers. The company allowed 300 livres for
                    construction of the fort and 1,170 livres for the subsistence of the men during the first year. It
                    also allowed 800 livres for presents to the Indians. The pay of the soldiers and other expenses
                    brought the total allowance for the year up to 3,230 livres.
            Perier objected to the smallness of the company's allowance. He wrote that labor was high
                    and that it would cost 600 instead of 300 livres to build a suitable fort. He declared also that for
                    presents to the Indians not less than 3,000 livres should be set aside. He promised to go ahead with
                    the project, however, and informed the company that he would leave the selection of a site for the
                    post to 
                        Vincennes

                        Vincennes
                     was still too sick to undertake the expedition and it was four months after Perier
                    promised to follow the company's instructions before he was able to set out.41
                    
                        Vincennes
                     apparently thought it best not to build a fort at once

                            . "La première, que ce fort ne peut se soutenir que par le
                            secours des sauvages Miamis, et qu'il n'y a pas d'aparenee
                            qu'on puisse les déterminer a venir se placer dans un lieu si eloignw du
                            pais qu'ils occupent. La seconde, que quand ce fort seroit bien solide et
                            appuyé par les Miamis au bord de la Rivière de Ouabache, non seulement
                            cette disposition n'empecheroit pas les Anglois de S'Btablir sur celle des
                            trois Rivières en question qu'ils jugeroient à propos; mais
                            encore Elle leur en procureroit les moyens, parce que n'y aiant plus de sauvages
                            dans le haut des Rivières qui pussent s'oposer a leurs desseins ils
                            pourroient si fortifier, s'extendre, et se mettre en Etat de tomber tout
                            d'un coup sur l'Etablissement de Ouabache …" First,
                            this fort cannot sustain itself except by the aid of the savage Miamis, and it Is not likely
                            that we can persuade them to come, settle In a place so far from the country which they
                            occupy. Second, when this fort will be very solid and supported by the Miamis on the banks
                            of the 
                                Wabash
                            , not only this disposition will not prevent the English from establishing on
                            these three rivers in question which they will justly judge, but still it will procure for
                            them the means, because no longer having the savages at the source of the rivers which
                            opposes their plans, they can fortify, extend, and place themselves In a position
                            to' suddenly fall on the

                     but to resume his residence among the Miamis.42 He gave as his reason that it would avoid a useless expense because the Indians would not
                    move down to the place where he wished to locate the post. It is probable, too, that he did not feel
                    that he had enough money to undertake the building of a fort, for the next spring Perier was still
                    declaring that the project could not be carried through with the allowance the company had made.43
            
            
               
                        Vincennes

                     post during the next three or four years,44 but in 1733 Salmon
                    wrote that he did not know whether or not 
                        Vincennes
                     had yet built his fort.45

                        Vincennes

                    one there if he had had the force. He complained that he had no

                            expense which would become useless because, surely, other, than the Miamis would not all
                            settle on the three rivers, those who while remaining would be able to press the hand of the
                            English in place of remaining among them as is loved and esteemed by that nation.

                    He believed that every year furs to the value of 30,000 livres could be obtained at this post.48 About the same time, 
                        Vincennes
                     wrote another letter "Du fort de Ouabache ce 21e mars 1733."49
            
            It appears evident that 
                        Vincennes
                     lived among the Miamis for at least four years before building his post. It could not
                    have been before late in 1732 or early in 1733 that the foundations for the new establishment were
                        laid.50
            
            Every French post was supposed to be a mission, but there were many difficulties and delays before
                    there was a mission on the 
                        Wabash
                    . Every plan, however, for establishment of the post included provision for a
                    missionary. In 1716 Crozat, who then held a patent for 
                        Louisiana
                    , suggested that since the Jesuits were already in the 
                        Illinois
                     country, they should furnish a priest for the 
                        Wabash
                    .51 In 1724, provision was made for a mission as soon as the post
                    should be established.52 The next year the Jesuit order in 
                        Louisiana

                             because there is always a lack of merchandise. In this place the fort which I
                            have built is 80 leagues up the 
                                Wabash
                             above the river where the English could have gone down and traded with the

                    "chapel" and materials for building a house and church. The boat in which he was
                    traveling ran into ice above the mouth of the

                    the sum of two thousand five hundred livres. The governor and intendant also relieved Beaubois from

                     losses, Father Doutreleau was sent to the Chickasaw post57 but in
                    1729 he was still listed as attached to the 
                        Wabash
                    . This project for a mission apparently was allowed to drop for nothing more is said of
                    it. An official list of missionaries in 
                        Louisiana
                     drawn up in 1731 made no mention of the

                    .58
            
            In 1734 the governor and intendent of 
                        Louisiana
                     wrote that a father de Guienne was at the 
                        Wabash
                     on business for the Jesuits. A missionary there was badly needed and they requested
                    Father de Beaubois to keep de Guienne there until they could hear from the company.59 After this no mention of a missionary at the 
                        Wabash
                     appears in the reports of the post until after the death of

            In 1732 Bienville returned as governor of 
                        Louisiana
                     and he at once renewed his plans for destroying the power of the Chickasaw and other
                    Indian tribes friendly to the English. He ordered St. Ange, who was still in command at Fort de
                    Chartres, to organize the Indians of the north to help in the proposed attack.60
                    St. Ange reported, however, that the Indians of his territory were in bad humor and 
                        Vincennes
                     declared that the tribes around his post were no less dissatisfied. The 
                        Wabash
                     tribes were complaining because the French failed to supply them with the goods they
                    wanted and were trading actively with the English.61

                     that his garrison was too small to control the Indians. He
                    asked for a force of thirty men and an officer.62 Although the fort at this time
                    was in good condition it needed a veneer of stone to make it strong enough to withstand any attack
                    and it would have to be made larger to accommodate any reinforcements. It contained barracks for the
                    small force detached there and a house which 
                        Vincennes
                     had built at his own expense.63

                        Vincennes
                     at once. He planned, furthermore, to use every effort to restore French authority on

                     himself stood high in the confidence of Bienville who frequently praised him for his
                    energy, wisdom, and general usefulness.65 His great influence among the Miamis
                    also told heavily in his favor.66

            In the spring of 1733 war broke out between the French and the Chickasaws. These Indians had long
                    been friends of the English and they were the most dangerous obstacle to Bienville's plans.
                    They expressed a desire, however, to remain at peace with 
                        Vincennes
                     and his Miamis, and sent a Frenchman whom they had captured, to 
                        Vincennes
                     with direct proposals for peace.67
            
            
               
                        Vincennes
                     was in difficult straits. He was without Indian trading goods and the English were
                    getting all the Indian furs. The Miamis were becoming insolent and 
                        Vincennes
                     reported that he feared some evil among them. The Chickasaws soon renewed their
                    hostility and were even threatening his post.68
            
            Beauharnois, the governor of 
                        Canada
                    , was urging the northern Indians to begin war upon the Chickasaws. He sent a pipe and
                    belt to the 
                        Illinois
                     Indians to urge them to join in the attack. In the spring of 1733 many Indians were
                    journeying south for the great attack.89 The expedition, however, came to
                    nothing. Bienville opposed the plans of Beauharnois to begin active fighting in the spring. The
                    autumn, he argued, would be a more suitable time for the attack, for then the invading armies could
                    live upon the provisions the Chickasaws had stored for the winter.70
            
            In spite of the threat of a general Indian war which would make the exposed 
                        Wabash
                     post one of the most probable points of Indian attack, 
                        Vincennes
                     decided, in the spring of 1733 to go to 
                        Canada
                    . He had permission to make the trip from the governor of 
                        Canada
                    , but apparently did not even take the trouble to ask for leave from his superiors in 
                        Louisiana
                    . He informed Bienville that he was going to look after

                     began his journey in the spring of 1733 and did not return until the following winter.
                    He came back with a complaint that Beauharnois required "habitants" of 
                        Illinois
                     to buy a conge before he would allow them to return to their
                        homes.71 He also reported to D'artaguiette that more than a hundred
                    Canadian families were ready to migrate to the 
                        Wabash
                     and 
                        Illinois
                     countries but were detained by the governor.72
            
            The spring of 1734 brought renewed activity in affairs of the 
                        Wabash
                    . Bienville promised to furnish the thirty men that 
                        Vincennes
                     had requested a year before, and ordered D'artaguiette to supply them from his
                    troops. He wrote that he regarded the 
                        Wabash
                     post as one of the most important in the colony and that it must by all means be
                        maintained.73
                    
                        Vincennes
                     also had in mind to strengthen his position by bringing other Indians to reinforce
                    those already at the post. There was a village of Piankishaws on the 
                        Wabash
                     some sixty leagues above the post and these had been trading with the English. If 
                        Vincennes
                     could bring them down to his post he would thus not only make his position more secure

                     but would also deprive the English of a source of considerable
                        trade.74
            
            The English were continually increasing the volume of their trade in the Ohio
                    valley and it was doubtless to check these activities that the French were giving so much
                    attention to the 
                        Wabash
                     fort. The English had two trading depots on the 
                        Ohio
                     from which they were pushing to the southwest and the northwest.75
                    
                        Vincennes
                     was entrusted with the task of keeping the Miami nations safe from the line of these
                    invading rivals.
            There were two difficulties in the way of the French plans. 
                        Vincennes
                     lacked the trading goods the Indians loved and which they could buy cheaply from the
                    English, and the French soldiers were discontented and undependable. 
                        Vincennes
                     complained bitterly that his superiors failed to send him the necessary trading goods
                    and in one letter gave a long list of missing articles.76 In the spring of 1735,
                    five men deserted the 
                        Wabash
                     post and joined the English.77 Desertions from Fort de Chartres
                    were frequent. Bienville declared that the English were trying to win over the Choc-taws and other
                    Indians friendly to the French and form a great Indian confederacy under their control.78
            
            The danger was so threatening that Bienville resolved upon war. 
                        France
                     and Great Britain were at peace but this did not deter him from forming plans to
                    destroy the Indian friends of the rival nation.
            His first objective was the Chickasaws who lived to the south of the 
                        Ohio
                    . They had long been intercepting the P'rench who were trading along the 
                        Mississippi
                    . They dealt exclusively with the English and their destruction would seriously cripple
                    English trade west of the Alleghanies.
            Bienville, as a pretext for war, demanded the surrender of some Natchez Indians who had taken refuge

                     Chickasaws after a disastrous war with the French. This demand
                    was promptly refused and war began.
            With an army of Frenchmen and Choctaws, Bienville planned to march north. D'artaguiette with
                    a force composed of soldiers, habitants, and Illinois Indians, and Vin-cennes with
                    his Miamis and a small band of Iroquois, were to march south. The rendezvous was fixed for Ecors a
                    Prud-homme on the tenth of March, 1736.79 At the same time, another expedition
                    was to destroy the Shawnees.80
            
            For some reason Bienville did not leave Mobile until April l,81 and it was the
                    last of May when he reached the Chickasaw villages. D'Artaguiette arrived at Ecors a
                    Prudhomme the last of February or the first of March.82 A few days later 
                        Vincennes
                     joined him. Here they built a fort of stones and sent scouts to locate Bienville. They
                    returned with no information but some runners came down from the 
                        Illinois
                     with news that Bienville had sent word he could not arrive at the rendezvous before the
                    end of April. D'Artaguiette called a council of war. The Indians declared that their
                    provisions were nearly gone and they could not remain long. They proposed to attack a Chickasaw
                    village which they had discovered some distance from the main camp. If they could capture enough
                    provisions, they declared, they would then be willing to await the arrival of Bienville.
            D'Artaguiette agreed to this and on the night of March 24, the party stole to within a short
                    distance of the village. Early the next morning the French and Indians made their attack. The fight
                    had hardly started when four or five hundred Chickasaws came to the rescue of the village. The
                    French and the Iroquois and Arkansas Indians stood bravely

                     80 Ecors à Prudhomme was located on the east bank of the 
                                Mississippi

                            La Salle built a fort here. It received its name from a Canadian who died there. Relation de la Louisiane par Penicourt, 403.

                     but the other Indians ran away. D'Artaguiette was
                    killed in action and possibly St. Ange, junior, his first lieutenant. 
                        Vincennes
                    , Father Senat, and several other officers and men were taken prisoners and most of them
                    were burned the same day; one account says "From three in the afternoon until towards
                        midnight."83 The remnant of the French forces was met by some
                    reinforcements with whose assistance they succeeded in getting back to Ecors a Prudhomme on the
                    twenty-ninth.
            When Bienville arrived in the Chickasaw country two months later he found no trace of this party
                    which he expected to join him. His scouts reported that the only Europeans of whom they could find
                    any trace were English traders. He retreated without making a serious attack and blamed
                    D'Artaguiette for his ill-success. He, however, suffered a serious loss of prestige from
                    this failure.84 It was not long before he was planning another campaign to
                    retrieve his reputation, but the English had already gained a firm foothold on the 
                        Ohio
                    .85
            
            A son of the old St. Ange who had commanded at the 
                        Illinois
                    , and a brother of the lieutenant who was killed at the Chickasaw village, succeeded 
                        Vincennes
                     in command of the 
                        Wabash
                     post. He was appointed at the solicitation of his father, but Bienville commended him
                    as one who knew the savages and was known by them.86 St Ange was promoted in
                    1749 to the rank of captain with half pay87 and

                            contré les Chicachas. Ibid. C13 C4, 202. Rickarville says he
                            was held prisoner hy the Chlckasaws for eighteen months when he and another Frenchman,
                            assisted to escape by an English trader, of whom there were a number among the Chickasaws,
                            got away. He first reached 
                                Georgia
                             and met Oglethorpe who allowed him to go north through the English colonies to 
                                Canada
                            .
                  
                     84 Some time after this, February 15, 1737, Bienville wrote a rather
                            lame letter of excuses to the Minister of Marine. Ibid. C13 A22, 70.
                  
                     85 Besides the accounts of the Chlckasaws war mentioned above,
                            Grandpré, who commanded among the 
                                Arkansas
                             and led a body of reinforcements that arrived to cover the retreat, wrote a
                            report dated "24 Xbre, 1728" [1738(7)]. This agrees in detail with the
                            others.
                  
                     86 Bienville, 29 juin, 1736, wrote of him "il commande
                            actuellement un petit poste sur le missoury. Bt il y a Longtemps que Mr.
                            D'artaguiette, m'en avoit parlé comme d'un garcon
                            brave et d'un grand merite. Ibid. C13 A21. At present, he is
                            commanding a small post on the 
                                Missouri
                            , and a long time ago Mr. D'artaguiette spoke to me of him, as being a
                            brave boy and of great merit. Bienville again recommended him on October 30. Ibid. D2 C51, 142.
               
                     remained commander of the post until it was surrendered to the
                    English.
            His position was not an easy one. The Piankeshaws who had lived around the post left it and joined
                    other kinsmen higher up the river at 
                        Vermillion
                    .88 This left the fort without adequate protection and cost it much
                    of its usefulness as a trading post. It could no longer be regarded as a barrier to the English who
                    were now working down the 
                        Ohio
                    . The Cherokees and Chickasaws, apparently under English tutelage, had established their
                    villages on the 
                        Ohio
                    .89 In view of all these circumstances Bienville soon ordered that
                    the fort be moved to the junction of the two rivers.90
            
            For some reason Bienville's orders were not carried out. Perhaps it was because the removal
                    would cost too much, perhaps because the next year the Cherokees and Chickasaws withdrew from their
                    threatening position on the 
                        Ohio
                    .91 Perhaps there was opposition to Bienville's choice of a
                    location, for the site he had selected was low and unprotected. The next year Bienville wrote that
                    Buissonniere, who commanded at Fort de Chartres, would go in the spring of 1739 to find the most
                    suitable place for the new post. In 1740 the location had not yet been decided upon, but Bienville
                    was still planning to send an engineer to examine the ground.92 He and Salmon
                    had decided that it was best also to abandon the 
                        Illinois
                     fort and build a great stone fort on the 
                        Wabash
                     as an effective barrier against the English. They estimated the cost of this at 130,000
                        livres.93 In 1741 Bienville decided that the mouth of the Cherokee
                        river was the best

                            wrote of the fort, "Je pense qu'Effectivement II est plus Couteux
                            qu'il n'est utile Cependant II seroit de Conséqence de le
                            conserver pour Empecher les Anglois de s'y Etablir, ce quils feront certainement si
                            nous l'abandon nons." Ibid. C13 A21, 192. I shall send
                            him orders for this change which will not be of a great expense. –I certainly
                            think that it is more costly than it Is useful. However, it will be Important to keep it in
                            order to prevent the English from settling it, which they will certainly do if we abandon
                            it.

                     place for the new fort. The 
                        Wabash
                     Indians, however, refused to remove there because, they said, the region was subject to
                    inundation. Bienville suspected that Canadian traders were responsible for their objections94 which put an end to his schemes.
            In 1743 Vaudreuil succeeded Bienville as governor of 
                        Louisiana
                    . He planned at once to send traders among all the Indian nations of his province and to
                    do all in his power to make the fur trade flourish. He hoped by this means to increase French
                    influence among the Indians, and thus to weaken the English. Another and very important part of his
                    plan was to establish a fort on the 
                        Ohio
                    , to stop the incursions of the Cherokees, and to check the ambition of the English.95 This fort was to be of stone and would become the key to the colony. Without
                    it he declared the English would cut the communications between 
                        Louisiana
                     and 
                        Canada
                    . He hoped to bring down to this fort the Kickapoos and Musquotins who had expressed
                    their willingness to abandon their homes at "terre haute".
               96 Vaudreuil further hoped to add to these tribes the Shawnee who, he wrote, had
                    promised Beauharnois, three years before, to settle with them at "terre
                        haute".
               97 Soon after he wrote that the Shawnees had actually
                    come down the 
                        Ohio
                     and were ready to fall in with his plans.98 A year later, however,
                    he had come to distrust them because of the proximity of the English to the 
                        Wabash
                     and urged that they be kept at 
                        Detroit
                    .99
            
            De Bailly, who apparently had the confidence of the government, supported Vaudreuil's
                    proposals by pointing out the many advantages of a post at the mouth of the 
                        Ohio
                    . He declared that there the soil was rich, that buffalo were numerous, that it was an
                    excellent place both for trade with the Indians and to hold communication between 
                        Louisiana
                     and 
                        Canada
                    . He maintained that the French could deliver goods by water to this post much more
                    cheaply than the English

                     could transport them across the mountains.100 Apparently the king gave some sort of approval to Vaudreuil's plan and permission
                    to establish the new post but no action was taken because the permission was not positive enough.101
            
            During King George's war the English penetrated far into the 
                        Wabash
                     country. In 1751 an English hunter was captured only a short distance from the 
                        Wabash
                     post.102 The danger from the English became so great that in 1753
                    it was planned to send three thousand men to hold the 
                        Wabash
                     and 
                        Ohio
                    .103 Kerlerec, who succeeded Vaudreuil, felt as keenly as his
                    predecessor the danger from English invasions of the 
                        Wabash
                     country.104 He, too, believed that it was necessary to build a fort
                    at the mouth of the 
                        Ohio
                    .105 He declared also that the French must supply more goods for the
                    Indian trade. The Indians were complaining at the lack of attention, while the English had
                    established six posts among the Cherokees.106 All of these proposals apparently
                    assumed that the 
                        Vincennes
                     post should be abandoned and a new fort constructed in a better location.107 Nothing was done, however, and 
                        Vincennes
                     passed intact out of French hands.
            Although Post 
                        Vincennes
                     was always regarded by the French as a military post, yet it developed a civic life, of
                    which we have only fleeting glimpses. The records of the

                    insects," while they were in transport to 
                        Illinois
                     after the surrender of the post to the English.108 The habitans, however, sought to maintain their title to their lands by affidavits. One title
                    was derived from a grant by 
                        Vincennes
                     and confirmed by Bienville, though no date was given. Haldimand states that St. Ange
                    apparently made about seventy grants during the twenty-eight years he commanded the post. Most of
                    these were confirmed by Kerlerec who was governor of 
                        Louisiana
                     from 1753 to 1763. Some, however, were confirmed by Vau-dreuil who was governor for ten
                    years preceding Kerlerec. D'abadie who succeeded Kerlerec, confirmed twelve titles.
            The earliest dated title was 1749.109 In 1758, Kerlerec reported that there were
                    eighteen or twenty habitans beside the fifty men who composed the garrison. They
                    supplied themselves, according to him, by the cultivation of wheat, corn and tobacco.110 These habitans were also much interested in trade. In 1754, they had
                    threatened to abandon the settlement because restrictions had been placed on their trade. They
                    protested, and received the support of Kerlerec.111
            
            There were probably seventy families living around Post 
                        Vincennes
                     at the time of its surrender to the British.112 Some

                             and St. Ange are planning to abandon both these posts that the inhabitants
                            ought to be free in their commerce and enjoy the fruit of their work in order to maintain
                            them there.
                  
                     112 There were fifty-six heads of families who signed a memorial to
                            General Gage, September 18, 1772 (0. O. 5, 90, 265). As already noted, there were about
                            seventy grants of land made by St. Ange. An enclosure with the letter of General Gage to
                            Hillsborough dated January 6, 1769, stated that at "St Vincents on the Ouabache
                            there were 232 inhabitants." Ibid. 87, 75.
               
                     of them doubtless left with St. Ange to join their brothers who
                    had crossed the 
                        Mississippi
                    . In 1768, there were reported as still remaining 232 inhabitants besides 168 strangers.
                    They possessed ten negro slaves and seventeen Indian slaves. They had two hundred and sixty head of
                    horses, two hundred and ninety-five hogs, and'nearly a thousand head of cattle. Their grain
                    in the field was estimated at more than ten thousand bushels, and their tobacco at 36,360 pounds.
                    They were also provided with three mills.113
            
            Agriculture was probably not the chief means of livelihood of the men settled about the post. One
                    officer reported that"at Post Vincent, there is no other Money
                        passes but Peltry and generally Furrs, but I can Assure Your Excellency that no other person
                        Except Bayntin & Company have given Bond that their Peltry shall be landed at a British
                        Market. And it is certain that their is not one Twentieth part of the Trade in this Country, all
                        the rest must of Consequence go to the French Markets."
            
            He further declared that great quantities of French goods were daily introduced.114
            
            General Gage was alarmed at the great number of strangers who had come to 
                        Vincennes
                    . He declared that "Strollers and Vagabonds from 
                  Canada, Detroit, Illinois
                and other Places, have assembled there, to live a
                    lazy kind of Indian Life or taken Shelter there from Justice."115
                    Apparently numerous reports came to him of French violations of rules regarding trade, for in 1772,
                    he issued a proclamation ordering all the inhabitants of 
                        Vincennes
                     and the 
                        Wabash
                     country to abandon their homes and to go at once to some of the English colonies.116
            
            The habitants responded in a spirited memorial that they were not vagabonds but peaceful cultivators
                    of the soil. They protested that they had no means of transporting their wives and children to the
                    other colonies, "with only a vain hope of

                     116 8 April, 1772. Gage gave as his reason that "lis raSnent
                            une vie vaga-bonde sans Gouvernement et sans Loi, interrompent le cours libre du Commerce,
                            detruisent le Gibier, et causent des Brouilleries infernales dans le Pais." Ibid. 90, 281. They lead a vagabond life without government and without
                            law, interrupting the free course of commerce, destroy the game, and cause infernal
                            confusions in the peace.
               
                     being received as other subjects." They declared that
                    their land titles were derived from the French king while he reigned over the country, and that they
                    were protected by the treaty of peace. They furthermore denied all the charges that Gage had made
                    against them.117
            
            Gage was apparently impressed by the reply of the inhabitants of 
                        Vincennes
                    , for he wrote to Dartmouth that he could not "venture to decide whether they
                    are People settled under legal Titles or Strollers who have taken Land without authority."
                    He believed that there might be some of both kinds.118
            
            Gage soon left for 
                        England
                     and Haldemand was left to handle the situation. He informed Dartmouth that the plan of
                    removal was not feasible and that most of the accounts of 
                        Vincennes
                     had come "from Jealous and self-interested Traders".119 He wrote to the people of 
                        Vincennes
                     that the king would protect their rights under the treaty and would grant them every
                    opportunity to prove title to their lands. Those that appeared just he would confirm.120 With this promise, the inhabitants of 
                        Vincennes
                     were apparently content. In accordance with the proclamation of 1763 no more grants of
                    land were made121 and 
                        Vincennes
                     doubtless went to sleep until the coming of George Rogers Clark.
            The British never established any government of their own at Post 
                        Vincennes
                    . When St. Ange left in 1754, the Iwubitans apparently chose their own
                    rulers. A. M. Chapart was cammandant in 1768, and St. Marie took the position probably about 1770
                    and held it for several years. A statement to Haldemand in 1774 was signed by Pertheille
                    "depute de la part des habitants du poste Vincene", and Phillibert
                    "notaire Royal".122
            
            The British, however, paid little attention to 
                        Vincennes
                     and it was not until the expedition of George Rogers Clark that the post became for a
                    brief period again an object of importance.

            A Journal of Travel from 
                        New York
                     to Indiana in 1827
            By DR. SAMUEL BERNARD JUDAH
            
            The author of this little journal, Dr. Samuel Bernard Judah, was born in 
                        New York City
                     in 1777, and was the son of Samuel Judah, the immigrant, who, coming from 
                        London
                     about 1760, was a leading merchant of 
                        New York
                     thereafter. This first Samuel Judah is mentioned in the Jewish
                        Encyclopedia as an ardent supporter of the American Revolution, to which indeed he devoted
                    the greater part of a not inconsiderable fortune. The only recompense he ever received for this was
                    a personal letter of thanks and appreciation from George Washington, and that also was afterwards
                    lost in a fire.
            Dr. Judah lived in 
                        New York city
                     all his life except a few years spent at 
                  New
                            Brunswick, New Jersey
               , where
                    his son Samuel Judah (later of Indiana) was a student at Rutgers college. This last named Samuel
                    Judah graduated from college in 1816, studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1818, and shortly
                    thereafter made his way to Indiana, locating in 1819 at 
                        Vincennes
                    , then one of the most important towns in the state. By 1827 Samuel Judah had made for
                    himself a professional reputation throughout the southern and central parts of the state, and for
                    two years had been married. To visit his son was the principal object of Dr. Judah's trip.
            The traveller was no longer young, physically rather delicate, and accustomed to what are called the
                    comforts of life. One is amazed at his acceptance of rigors and hardships of travel which would
                    appal and exhaust a strong man of today.
            The Journal was written solely for the use of the writer himself, for future
                    reference, statistics and recollections, without any thought of form or care to avoid repetition.
            The only interest that these notes con now claim is as data of a long journey into our own west
                    nearly a century ago; and as a description of life and conditions that happened to attract the
                    writer's rather discursive attention. And it contains here and there personal touches
                    disclosing the distinctive qualities of "types" whom the writer met, as well as
                    something of the sophisticated attitude of an elderly city-man for the first time in a new country.

                                    hurricane.
                        Oct. 21st–Still at

                                    –Pretty place–took no dinner, did not like the
                                    provision. Still rainy, stormy, disagreeable weather–6 barbers, 3,000
                                    inhabitants–mostly Jacksonians. Slept here, the stage not arriving as
                                    expected. Supped as ordered by myself–pretty good.
                        Oct. 22nd–Weather still disagreeable. Stage arrived & I left here
                                    at 3 p. m., arriving at Canandagua at 7 p. m.–still raining.
                        Oct. 23rd–Canandagua is a beautiful place–Steam mill and
                                    windmill–steamboat on the lake, which is 20 miles long. There are 2
                                    banks, Female Seminary, Academy, Court House, Arsenal, Jail–8 a. m. left
                                    this place–12 o'clock reached Bushnels, New Presbyterian Church
                                    building. Here whisky began to appear. Two very pretty girls got in here to go as
                                    far as 
                                        Rochester
                                    –very agreeable. At 3 o'clock arrived at 
                                        Rochester
                                    . To say anything in its favor would be needless– Very busy
                                    life–3 new churches building, and new houses in
                                    abundance–muddy over shoe tops–no rain, but cloudy with high
                                    winds. Put up at Noye's–good, genteel house. Delivered my
                                    letters to S. M. Smith–very polite–showed me the town, ec. I
                                    dined with him–7,000 inhabitants–Town is 3 miles from
                                        Lake Ontario–considerable trade with upper 
                                        Canada
                                    . There is a Roman Catholic Chapel and a 
                                        Quaker
                                     meeting, 4 very good public houses. Wool, Cotton, Pail and Sash  factories–8 acres given by an
                                    individual for a college. A beautiful aqueduct on a bridge over which the canal
                                    boats pass and repass–Astonishing! Met Billy Van Dorn–much
                                    altered.
                        Oct. 24th–Left 
                                        Rochester
                                     at 5 a. m. Traveled with a very clever fellow named Dibble–a
                                    lawyer–passed Gainsborough, Bridgeway, Hartland–here commenced
                                    the Ridge road. I never saw a more perfect road. At ½ past 9 p. m.
                                    arrived at Lewiston–a village of Tuscarora Indians, upper 
                                        Canada
                                     opposite. Placed burned during the last war. Now rebuilt.
                        Oct. 25th–Left Lewiston at ½ past 7 a. m.–arrived at 
                                        Niagara Falls
                                     at 9. Falls grand beyond description. Large paper mills. I do not like
                                    the village. At 2 p. m. arrived at 
                                        Tonawanda
                                    , on Niagara River–roads very bad. ½ past 4 p. m.
                                    arrived at 
                                        Buffalo
                                    . I suppose there are greater prospects of increasing commerce here than
                                    at any place in the State of 
                                        New York
                                    . Lake Erie–a beautiful prospect. The
                                    Steamer Superior left here at noon. The Henry Clay does not leave until the
                                    30th–So I left Buffalo on the Steamboat Pioneer for Dunkirk. Owing to
                                    shaft breaking put back to Buffalo.
                        Oct. 26th–Left Buffalo at 6 a. m. in a common wagon with oil cloth cover
                                    with 6 passengers over a railroad–fine view of the lake. Breakfast at 
                                        Hamburg
                                     10 a. m.–4 p. m. arrived at Cataraugus Creek. Here I came
                                    near to getting into a hobble. From Buffalo to this place there was a foot traveler
                                    who kept ahead of us. On getting here he was here before us. He was meanly dressed
                                    and carried a pack on his back. On stopping at the Tavern I spoke to him and offered
                                    him a drink, commending his spirit in walking. He declined and took a seat in the
                                    stage. I now learned that he was a Judge of 
                                        Cataraugus County
                                    , a drover–had been to 
                                        New York
                                    , was rich. I was mortified–a good lesson to me. Traveled 30
                                    miles along the Lake Shore to this place. A fine bridge owned
                                    by Rufus S. Reed, who receives toll. Here we took post coaches and at 9 p. m.
                                    arrived at Freedonia 3 miles from Dunkirk on Lake Erie. Baptist
                                    and Presbyterian Churches here-Nasty, dirty bed and bedding. Left this place with
                                    pleasure– never disliked a place so much in my life.
                        
                        Oct. 27th–Left Fredonia at 9 a. m., and at 12 arrived at 
                                        Westfield
                                     where we had a good breakfast–and then to 
                                        Ripley
                                    . This finishes my tour in the good and great State of 
                                        New York
                                    –587 miles to 
                                        New York City
                                    . At 3 p. m. entered the State of 
                                        Pennsylvania
                                     at the village of North East, where an Irishman keeps a tavern in a log
                                    cabin. Says he has been here 28 years–happy and contented. Says he is a
                                    prince. Has a farm of 150 acres, with everything plenty about him. At ½
                                    past 7 p. m. arrived at 
                                        Erie
                                     on the Lake–still rainy and stormy. At 9 p. m. passed the
                                    line, into 
                                        Ohio
                                    . Rode all night.
                        Oct 28th–At 4:30 a. m. arrived at 
                                        Salem
                                     and at 8 at 
                                        Ashtabula
                                     for breakfast. A bood wholesome girl traveled with with us the last 43
                                    miles, hunting her husband who had left her–poor thing–get
                                    another! Crossed Grand River–2 Forges, 4 Furnaces,
                                    Grist Mill–beautiful meadows here to be seen–pretty village.
                                    Mr. Bayard, of 
                                        Princeton
                                    , NJ., joined me at Erie–Town at Chaplin. Thus far, through 
                                        Pennsylvania
                                    , it is common for the farmers to have their barns on the front of the
                                    road and their log cabins behind. Common for the women to break and hackle the flax
                                    and work in the fields. Plenty of buckwheat raised. At 8 p. m. arrived at 
                                        Cleveland
                                     –still rainy & very stormy–waters very
                                    high & dangerous to cross–very bad roads. 
                                        Cleveland
                                     is a very handsome place. 
                                        Ohio
                                     canal completed 38 miles to Akron. Prospects of business here are very
                                    great.
                        Oct. 29th–Had to remain at 
                                        Cleveland
                                     this day for want of a stage. 4 packet boats & 8 canal boats on
                                    the canal. Living is cheap–foreign goods low priced–people
                                    well informed –log cabins planty–good orchards–7
                                    lawyers.
                        Oct. 30th–It having rained & stormed to such a degree that bridges
                                    were carried away, I left 
                                        Cleveland
                                     at 7 a. m. Breakfast at 
                                        Bedford
                                    –Mrs. King got in–passed through a large
                                    stream–very high water–Misery in all its shapes here began to
                                    make its appearance–Children naked–mud up to their knees
                                    & appeared not to have been washed for a month. Whisky more & more
                                    drank. Plenty appeared to be in the hands of every one & independence in
                                    reality. Passed Town of Hudson–a new college used as an Academy, Handsome
                                    country–miserable roads–rainy & stormy. Then

                                     –a neat town in a swamp. Arrived at 7 p. m. and stopped at
                                         pretty good house kept by a
                                    Yankee–2 weeks in this country –yet a real clever
                                    Yankee–has a son, a minister, and 2 handsome daughters, kept out of view,
                                    but peeking to see the passengers.
                        Oct. 31st–Left Middleburg at 6 a. m., very bad roads– drunken

                                    to proceed to Wooster. Jovial landlord, good supper, poor bed, dirty house, fine
                                    country, plenty & cheap. Cornstalks 10 ft high. Still stormy &
                                    rainy.
                        November 1.–At 7 a. m. left Wooster. Commenced with bad roads & up

                                    Fine weather at last. Spent a pleasant time. Visited the Medical School with Dr.

                                    18,000 to 20,000. Fine State, happy people, independent and easy in every

                                        Cincinnati
                                     for

                                 1 It may be interesting to notice the conditions of
                                            travel between 
                                                Cincinnati
                                             and 
                                                Louisville
                                             a few years before Dr. Judah's trip. In the fall of
                                            1816 Armstrong Brandon removed from 
                                    Piqua, Ohio
                                 , to Corydon the new state capital of Indiana. His
                                            family consisted of his wife and little daughter, Harriet, 8 years old, who
                                            afterwards became the wife of Samuel Judah of 
                                                Vincennes
                                            . She thus describes their trip:
                              "We traveled by land to 
                                                Cincinnati
                                             and there with Mr. Lodge's family embarked in a small
                                            flatboat called a family boat. When the boat landed, to stop for any length
                                            of time, I followed my father in his rambles over the country. My d3light
                                            was greatest first seeing an orchard of rosy apples. I suppose it was not a
                                            strange thing to see orchards about 
                                                Cincinnati
                                            , but in the vicinity of Piqua the orchards were still young. We
                                            landed at 
                                                Jeffersonville
                                             and hired wagons to take us to Corydon–passing
                                            through 
                                                New Albany
                                             where there were 2 or 3 cabins, one with a coonskin nailed on
                                            the outside.
                              Two years after, in the summer of 1818 we made a visit to our friends in 
                                                Ohio
                                            . We went from Corydon to 
                                                Jeffersonville
                                            . On examining the boats they were found to be so inconvenient
                                            that my father thought it best to go by land. The boats to go up the 
                                                Ohio
                                             called barges, were propelled by oars and sometimes sails, when
                                            the wind was favorable. The time from 
                                                Louisville
                                             to 
                                                Cincinnati
                                             averaged 2 weeks. As yet there was not a steamboat plying the
                                            river above the falls at 
                                                Louisville
                                            . To go by stage we had to go up to 
                                                Georgetown
                                            , Ky., and from there to

                                            . On the Indiana side the mail was carried on

                                  states that
                                            beginning in 1811 three or four steamboats built on the upper 
                                                Ohio
                                            , descended to

                                            , but their engine power was insufficient for returning aeninst
                                            the current. He fixes the fall of 1817, as the date of the commencement of
                                            steam navigation in the Mississippi valley, more
                                            powerful engines having been invented and then first employed between 
                                                New Orleans
                                             and

                                            , where the falls were an obstacle. He does not give any date as
                                            to steam navigation of the upper 
                                                Ohio
                                            . Probably it should date from 1819. J. M. J.

                                        Vincennes
                                    . Very disagreeable ride. Supped at Clark's Tavern, and at 8
                                    went to Samuel's he being at 
                                        Indianapolis
                                    , attending the Supreme Ct. Received by Mrs. Judah and her mother Mrs.
                                    Brandon.
                        Nov. 14–Today at 4 p. m. Samuel returned–I have spent my time
                                    very pleasantly the last two days–Had a view of the prairies on fire at
                                    night from Samuel's piazza. I am now 1,260 miles from 
                                        New York
                                    . 
                                        Vincennes
                                     is a melancholy-looking place. Good brick Court House–brick
                                    seminary–a few good brick houses, Genl Harrison's the most
                                    attractive. Samuel lives in a 2 story frame. 26 ft front 20 deep, 3 rooms below,
                                    also Kitchen & Smoke house, poorly built–Indeed all the houses in
                                    the west are so. There are 1600 inhabitants–7 stores well
                                    stocked–trade for 40 miles around–profits large.
                                    $10,000 worth of goods is a full stock for the largest merchant  for a year. The principal inhabitants get their
                                    groceries from 
                                        New Orleans
                                    . There is a cotton factory on a small scale operated by an Ox-mill, and
                                    a good public Library of 1800 vols. Very few of the houses are painted. Town lots
                                    are $35 to $50 the acre. Soil is sandy loam. Horticulture not
                                    much attended to. Samuel has the best garden here, tho only 1 year old. He has
                                    asparagus & celery, which are not common. His lot is 2½ acres,
                                    fine well–sheep; 2 horses, 2 cows, bee hives.
                        Emigrants pass daily, the poor to 
                                        Illinois
                                    , the richer to 
                                        Missouri
                                    , the middle class of emigrants go to Indiana and 
                              Michigan, Illinois
                            has a bad name, bad roads and bad public
                                    houses.
                        Indiana now has a population of 270,000; and this County (
                                        Knox
                                    ) has 5000. Laborers wages are 37½C a day and found.
                        Was present at Samuel's offce at an examination of some witnesses, sworn
                                    without book. Their words were written down by Saml and repeated by a Judge Moon.
                                    They were Canadian French. These people resemble the Canadians of Upper 
                                        Canada
                                     & have all their ways & customs, and are the
                                    descendants of those employed here by the fur traders 60 or 70 years ago.
                        The County Clerk is Homer Johnson. He is also Major-General of Militia, tavern
                                    keeper, schoolmaster, surveyor, doctor, & singing master.
                        This being Sunday I went with Mrs. Brandon to the Methodist Meeting. 25 women, 18
                                    men–considering all things it was pretty good. A raw young countryman
                                    exhorted–bad singing. Mr. Perrin, the Presbyterian preacher, said to be
                                    good. The people here are generally more on the moral order than given to priest
                                    craft; ministers are not much encouraged.
                        Nov. 20th–Winter has commenced very early here. Indian Summer is ended.
                        Nov. 21st–Fine morning–bright sun, but very cold. Flour
                                    $2.00 cwt, corn 10c bushel–cows $6–Beech
                                    & Sugar wood 75c cord. The plain people live on cornbread & hominy.
                                    Children are fed on mush & milk, economy is the custom. People are generally
                                    poorly clad–many blacks, poor miserable race. So much can be raised that
                                    the people in general labor but little. They have a great dnal of pride.
                        
                        Was introduced to a lawyer, General Johnson–not a military
                                    man–looked like anything but his name–poorly clad–
                                    summer pantaloons, shabby clothes & a cloak to hide all.
                        Though Whisky is drunk like water, considering the large population of 
                                        Ohio
                                     and Indiana, I have seen fewer drunkards than I expected. Men drink it
                                    by the quart & even the wealthy prefer it to any of the foreign liquors.
                                    Orchards and fruits are abundant. The apples about 
                                        Louisville
                                     were fine.
                        I have been makeing up my accounts. I spent 13^ days on the way when not
                                    traveling–delayed by storms & alterations of stage-days, viewing
                                    different places and a stop of 3 days in 
                                        Cincinnati
                                    . Including washings and postage, the total is $75.85.
                                    Generally I have ridden until 10 or 11 o'clock at night:–often
                                    up by 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning–but had only 2 whole
                                    night's rides, and only slept 2 nights in log Cabins.
                        Nov. 24th–It seems that the prevailing desire in the Western States is to
                                    have land, rather than money, tho land is very cheap. Yet I do not think a man of
                                    family can live cheaper in 
                                        Vincennes
                                     than in 
                                        New Brunswick
                                    , N. J. Fine farms near Vin-cennes can be bought at $2 or
                                    $3 the acre. A hard working man can buy the best of land from the U. S.
                                    at $1.25 the acre & in a very few years by industry can become an
                                    independent farmer and be what is called a good liver–that is, eat plenty
                                    of corn-bread–and pork into the bargain–but no molasses.
                                    Deliver me from their cookery.
                        I have been perfectly well since I have been in 
                                        Vincennes
                                     –look & feel better. I can not drink whiskey. Saml
                                    has some which is old, though it smells somewhat like bedbugs. I must say that I
                                    have eaten more than I did during the time I was coming from Buffalo here. The food
                                    at Samuel's is very good, tho, they have too much of
                                    everything–because it's plenty & cheap.2
                        
                        Nov. 26th–I have now been 15 days in

                                     and have concluded to start home tomorrow morning–have taken

                                 2 It was told afterward that the young mistress of
                                            house, in her desire to offer something fine to her father-in-law, procured
                                            with difficulty some salt codfish, which she served to the guest with modest
                                            pride–much to the secret amusement of her husband, who later in
                                            private explained to her that codfish to a man from the seaboard was not so
                                            much a delicacy as the quail, venison and wild turkey which were so
                                            frequently part of their own fare. J. M. J.

                                    Transylvania College, my name is Peter Breckinridge, with an M.D. to it. I am going
                                    to 
                                        Philadelphia
                                     with my horse and gig to attend the Medical Lectures, and after that
                                    with my horse & gig to 
                                        New York
                                    , and thence to 
                                        New Orleans
                                     and then home." He wished my advice as I was an eastern man. I
                                    told him to take his horse & gig home & return & go up the
                                    river and take stage to 
                                        Philadelphia
                                     & 
                                        New York
                                    , and in the spring return and take one of the packets to 
                                        New Orleans
                                     and return. He was thankful, said it was the best advice he  had rec'd. He was full of cash, and appeared
                                    to be everything but an M.D. He returned to Ky. with his horse & gig, and I
                                    saw him no more. At 
                                        Louisville
                                     I was offered a passage on a packet to 
                                        New Orleans
                                     for $20.
                        Went to Reading Room & read the 
                                        New York
                                     papers. Made various calls–Dr Price–Dr
                                    Wright–Robt F Lydell, who took me to the Criminal Court where we saw 2
                                    trials–1 for theft and 1 for assault & Battery. Mr De Young and
                                    Miss Joseph were married on the 21st. I called on them–Cakes &
                                    wine. They gave me a packet of Bridescake to be delivered to Piexotto at 
                                        Philadelphia
                                     for distribution to the damsels there.
                        Met Dr Asher a quack who was in 
                                        New Brunswick
                                     8 or 9 years ago & who did commit a theft by taking Joe
                                    Dunn's silver spoons. Had a very agreeable day & at 5 p. m. went on
                                    board the Fairy again, & at 6:15 we bade adieu to 
                                        Cincinnati
                                    , with 11 new cabin passengers, 3 of them ladies & I
                                    don't know haw many deck passengers–Played a rubber of whist,
                                    Fine evening.
                        Dec. 1st–Most of the Kentuckians are gamblers. The Ken-tuckians generally
                                    seem full of cash. Seven of the passengers played at cards till 1 a. m. Most of the
                                    passengers are Jack-sonians. In the night one of the Deck passengers made off with
                                    the boat. We stopped at Limestone, the proper name of which is
                                    Maysville–pretty town.
                        Dec. 2d–Got up at 6 O'clock–found the men unloading 40
                                    tons of lead on to the bank at 
                              Portsmouth, Ohio
                           . The boat being now light we go faster. 11 a. m. stopped
                                    to repair one of the wheels. Went ashore & walked–After an hour
                                    the repair being made, we proceeded. 6 p. m. passed mouth of the Big Sandy
                                        River. At 9 we overtook the steamer 
                                        Pennsylvania
                                     aground. She left 
                                        Cincinnati
                                     2 days before us. We took her passengers.
                        Dec. 3rd–Cloudy morning–Big Kanawha
                                    River–Coal mines. We have dragged on bottom several times.
                                    Moonlight night–Unwell.
                        Dec. 4th–Rainy & disagreeable–I am better, Views on the
                                    River are beautiful. The Indian name 
                                        Ohio
                                     signifies beautiful stream & it deserves this title. It is a
                                    grand and novel sight for one who had no idea of the western States to hourly see
                                    boats ascending & descending the inland river–besides the  great number of flat or keeled boats loaded
                                    with produce for 
                                        New Orleans
                                    . In the east it would be considered a dangerous navigation, but nothing
                                    is thought of it here, tho many strikes sawyers & sink & great loss
                                    is sustained. This trade gives employment to hundreds of men. These flatboatmen
                                    return up the river in steamboats as deck passengers which costs them nothing. Deck
                                    passengers are required to help loading & unloading. Ten years ago the
                                    flatboatmen returned on foot & experienced great hardships. Case is now
                                    altered. The advancement of the West is surprising. Happy people; all they want is
                                    the ambition of the East–Too little labor.
                        The morning fogs are very disagreeable, & unless you take some liquor you
                                    feel the effects. Of course, say the people of the west whisky, is the first of all
                                    good. I have not however, seen an habitual drunkard, tho whisky is drunk like water.
                                    The 
                                        Tuscaloosa
                                     & Monongohala whiskies are the best. The wine of 
                                        Vevay
                                     may rank as good summer wine, but I do not like it.
                        Arrived at

            By J. WESLEY WHICKAR
            
            I found recently a description of the Battle of 
                        Tippecanoe
                     by Sho-bonier, an 
                        Ottawa
                     Indian, who became a Potawatomi chief, and this with the description by Judge Isaac
                    Naylor, whose home was in Crawfords-ville, gives two good accounts of the Battle of 
                        Tippecanoe
                    . One from a white soldier, the other from an Indian brave, both participating in the
                    battle. In a publication entitled Me-Won-I-Toc, which was written in 1864 by Solon

                    OF TIPPECANOE.1
            
            It was fully believed among the Indians that we should defeat General Harrison, and that we should
                    hold the line of the

                     , July 17, 1859. His father was an 
                                Ottawa
                             who fought under Pontiac. The son, who was a man of fine parts and magnificent
                            presence, and was one of Tecumseh's Lieutenants, fought by his side when he was
                            killed at the battle of Thames. Becoming incensed at the treatment of the Indian allies by
                            the British commander, he with Sauganash transferred their allegiance to the Americans.
                            Joining the Potawatomi, among whom he married, he was chosen peace chief of the tribe, and
                            was their spokesman at the council with the representatives of the Government at 
                                Chicago
                             in August 1836. In the Winnebago and Black Hawk wars he performed invaluable
                            service for the. white pioneers, time and again saving the settlements from destruction by
                            timely warnings. When the Winnebago rose in 1827 he visited the Potawatomi villages to
                            dissuade them from taking up arms, and at the village on Geneva Lake, 
                                Wisconsin
                            , he was made a prisoner and threatened with death. As the white man's
                            friend he encountered the ill will of a large part of the Indians, but his influence over
                            his own tribe was sufficient to restrain it from joining in a body of forces of Black Hawk,
                            who twice went to Shabonee in person and tried to enlist him in his cause. Shabonee held his
                            tribe and remained true to the whites. As a council of the allied tribes in February 1832,
                            Shabonee espoused the cause of the whites and endeavored to convince Black Hawk that his
                            proposed uprising would only bring disaster to the Indians. Unsuccessful in his endeavor, he
                            and his son mounted their ponies at midnight, and starting from a point near the present
                                    
                        Princeton, Illinois
                     , warned the settlers both east and west of
                            the intended outbreak, Shabonee finally reaching 
                                Chicago
                             in time to put the inhabitants on their guard. The Sauk and Foxes in revenge
                            attempted many times to murder him, and killed his son and his nephew. In 1836 the
                            Potawatomi migrated beyond the 
                                Mississippi
                            , Shabonee went with them but returned shortly to the two sections of land at
                            his village, at the Pawpaw Grove in 
                        De Kalb
                                County, Illinois
                     , which the
                            Government had awarded him under the treaties of July 29, 1829 and October 20, 1832, as a
                            reward for his services. At the solicitation of his tribe he joined them again, but pined
                            for civilization, and in 1855 again returned to find that speculators had bought his two
                            sections of land at public sale on the grounds that he had abandoned it. The citizens of
                                    
                        Ottawa, Illinois
                     , then bought him a small farm on the South
                            Bank of the Illinois River, two miles above Seneca, 
                                Grundy County
                            , on which he passed his remaining
               
                    
                    
                        Wabash
                     and dictate terms to the whites. The great cause of our failure, was the Miamies, whose
                    principal country was south of the river, and they wanted to treat with the whites so as to retain
                    their land, and they played false to their red brethern and yet lost all. They are now surrounded
                    and will be crushed. The whites will shortly have all their lands and they will be driven away.
            In every talk to the Indians, General Harrison said: 
                        Lay down your arms. Bury the hatchet, already bloody with murdered victims, and promise to
                            submit to your great chief at 
                                Washington
                            , and he will be a father to you, and forget all that is past. If we take your
                            land, we will pay for it. But you must not think that you can stop the march of white men
                            westward.
                    
                
            There was truth and justice in all that talk. The Indians with me would not listen to it. It was
                    dictating to them. They wanted to dictate to him. They had counted his soldiers, and looked at them
                    with contempt. Our young men said: 
                        We are ten to their one. If they stay upon the other side, we will let them alone. If they
                            cross the 
                                Wabash
                            , we will take their scalps or drive them into the river. They cannot swim.
                            Their powder will be wet. The fish will eat their bodies. The bones of the white men will
                            lie upon every sand bar. Their flesh will fatten buzzards. These white soldiers are not
                            warriors. Their hands are soft. Their faces are white. One half of them are calico peddlers.
                            The other half can only shoot squirrels. They cannot stand before men. They will all run
                            when we make a noise in the night like wild cats fighting for their young. We will fight for
                            ours, and to keep the pale faces from our wigwams. What will they fight for? They
                            won't fight. They will run. We will attack them in the night.
                    
                
            Such were the opinions and arguments of our warriors. They did not appreciate the great strength of
                    the white men. I knew their great war chief, and some of his young men. He was a good man, very soft
                    in his words to his red children, as he called us; and that made some of our men with hot heads mad.
                    I listened to his soft words, but I looked into his eyes. They were full of fire. I knew that they
                    would be among his men like coals of fire in the dry grass. The first wind would 
                  years. He received an annuity of $200 from the Government for his services in
                            the Black Hawk War, which, with contributions from his friends, kept him from want. A
                            monument consisting of a large granite bowlder, was erected over his grave at Evergreen
                            cemetery, at Morris, 
                                Illinois

                     raise a great flame. I feared for the red men that might be
                    sleeping in its way. I, too, counted his men. I was one of the scouts that watched all their march
                    up the river from Vin-cennes. I knew that we were like these bushes–very many. They were
                    like these trees; here and there one. But I knew too, when a great tree falls, it crushes many
                    little ones. I saw some of the men shoot squirrels, as they rode along, and I said, the Indians have
                    no such guns. These men will kill us as far as they can see. "They cannot see in the
                    night," said our men who were determined to fight. So I held my tongue. I saw that all of
                    our war chiefs were hot for battle with the white men. But they told General Harrison that they only
                    wanted peace. They wanted him to come up into their country and show their people how strong he was,
                    and then they would all be willing to make a treaty and smoke the great pipe together. This was what
                    he came for. He did not intend to fight the Indians. They had deceived him. Yet he was wary. He was
                    a great war chief. Every night he picked his camping ground and set his sentinels all around, as
                    though he expected we would attack him in the dark. We should have done so before we did, if it had
                    not been for this precaution. Some of our people taunted him for this, and pretended to be angry
                    that he should distrust them, for they still talked of their willingness to treat, as soon as they
                    could get all the people. This is part of our way of making war. So the white army marched further
                    and further into our country, unsuspicious, I think, of our treachery. In one thing we were
                    deceived. We expected that the white warriors would come up on the south bank of the river, and then
                    we could parley with them; but they crossed far down the river and came on this side, right up to
                    the great Indian town that Elskatawwa had gathered at the mouth of the 
                        Tippecanoe
                    . In the meantime he had sent three chiefs down on the south side to meet the army and
                    stop it with a talk until he could get the warriors ready. Tecumseh had told the Indians not to
                    fight, but when he was away, they took some scalps, and General Harrison demanded that we should
                    give up our men as murders, to be punished.
            Tecumseh had spent months in traveling all over the country around Lake
                    Michigan, making great talks to all the warriors, to get them to join him in his great
                    designs upon the palefaces.  His enmity was the most bitter of
                    any Indian I ever knew. He was not one of our nation, he was a Shawnee. His father was a great
                    warrior. His mother came from the country where there is no snow, near the great water that is salt.
                    His father was treacherously killed by a white man before Tecumseh was born, and his mother taught
                    him, while he sucked, to hate all white men, and when he grew big enough to be ranked as a warrior
                    she used to go with him every year to his father's grave and make him swear that he would
                    never cease to make war upon the Americans. To this end he used all his power of strategy, skill and
                    cunning, both with white men and red. He had very much big talk. He was not at the battle of 
                        Tippecanoe
                    . If he had been there it would not have been fought. It was too soon. It frustrated all
                    his plans
            Elskatawwa was Tecumseh's older brother. He was a great medicine. He talked much to the
                    Indians and told them what had happened. He told much truth, but some things that he had told did
                    not come to pass. He was called "The Prophet." Your people knew him only by that
                    name. He was very cunning, but he was not so great a warrior as his brother, and he could not so
                    well control the young warriors who were determined to fight.
            Perhaps your people do not know that the battle of 
                        Tippecanoe
                     was the work of white men who came from 
                        Canada
                     and urged us to make war. Two of them who wore red coatss were at the
                    Prophet's Town the day that your army came. It was they who urged Elskatawwa to fight. They
                    dressed themselves like Indians, to show us how to fight. They did not know our mode. We wanted to
                    attack at midnight. They wanted to wait till daylight. The battle commenced before either party was
                    ready, because one of your sentinels discovered one of our warriors, who had undertaken to creep
                    into your camp and kill the great chief where he slept. The Prophet said if that was done we should
                    kill all the rest or they would run away. He promised us a horseload of scalps, and a gun for every
                    warrior, and many horses. The men that were to crawl upon their bellies into camp were seen in the
                    grass by a white man who had eyes like an owl, and he fired and hit his mark. The Indian was not
                    brave. He cried out. He should have lain still and died. Then the other men fired. The other Indians
                         were fools. They jumped up out of the grass and yelled.
                    They believed what had been told them, that a white man would run at a noise made in the night. Then
                    many Indians who had crept very close so as to be ready to take scalps when the white men ran, all
                    yelled like wolves, wild cats and screech owls; but it did not make the white men run.
            They jumped right up from their sleep with guns in their hands and sent a shower of bullets at every
                    spot where they heard a noise. They could not see "us. We could see them, for they had
                    fires. Whether we were ready or not we had to fight now for the battle was begun. We were still sure
                    that we should win. The Prophet had told us that we could not be defeated. We did not rush in among
                    your men because of the fires. Directly the men ran away from some of the fires, and a few foolish
                    Indians went into the light and were killed. One 
                        Delaware
                     could not make his gun go off. He ran up to a fire to fix the lock. I saw a white man
                    whom I knew very well– he was a great hunter who could shoot a tin cup from another
                    man's head–put up his gun to shoot the 
                        Delaware
                    . I tried to shoot the white man but another who carried the flag just then unrolled it
                    so that I could not see my aim. Then I heard the gun and saw the Delaware fall.
                    I thought he was dead. The white man thought so, too, and ran to him with his knife. He wanted a 
                        Delaware
                     scalp. Just as he got to him the 
                        Delaware
                     jumped up and ran away. He had only lost an ear. A dozen bullets were fired at the
                    white man while he was at the fire, but he shook them off like an old buffalo bull.
            Our people were more surprised than yours. The fight had been begun too soon. They were not all
                    ready. The plan was to creep up through the wet land where horses could not run, upon one side of
                    the camp, and on the other through a creek and steep bank covered with bushes, so as to be ready to
                    use the tomahawk upon the sleeping men as soon as their chief was killed. The Indians thought white
                    men who had marched all day would sleep. They found them awake.
            The Prophet had sent word to General Harrison that day that the Indians were all peaceable, that they
                    did not want to fight, that he might lie down and sleep, and they would treat with their white
                    brothers in the morning and bury the hatchet. But the white men did not believe.
            
            In one minute from the time the first gun was fired I saw a great war chief mount his horse and begin
                    to talk loud. The fires were put out and we could not tell where to shoot, except one one side of
                    the camp, and from there the white soldiers ran, but we did not succeed as the Prophet told us that
                    we would, in scaring the whole army so that all the men would run and hide in the grass like young
                    quails.
            I never saw men fight with more courage than these did after it began to grow light. The battle was
                    lost to us by an accident, or rather by two.
            A hundred warriors had been picked out during the night for this desperate service, and in the great
                    council-house the Prophet had instructed them how to crawl like snakes through the grass and strike
                    the sentinels; and if they failed in that, then they were to rush forward boldly and kill the great
                    war chief of the whites, and if they did not do this the Great Spirit, he said, had told him that
                    the battle would be hopelessly lost. This the Indians all believed.
            If the one that was first discovered and shot had died like a brave, without a groan, the sentinel
                    would have thought that he was mistaken, and it would have been more favorable than before for the
                    Indians. The alarm having been made, the others followed Elskatawwa's orders, which were,
                    in case of discovery, so as to prevent the secret movement, they should make a great yell as a
                    signal for the general attack. Ail iof the warriors had been instructed to creep up to the camp
                    through the tall grass during the night, so close that when the great signal was given, the yell
                    would be so loud and frightful that the whole of the whites would run for the thick woods up the
                    creek, and that side was left open for this purpose.
            "You will, then," said the Prophet, "have possession of their camp and all
                    its equipage, and you can shoot the men with their own guns from every tree. But above all else you
                    must kill the great chief."
            It was expected that this could be easily done by those who were allotted to rush into camp in the
                    confusion of the first attack. It was a great mistake of the Prophet's red-coated advisers,
                    to defer this attack until morning. It would have succeeded when the fires were brighter in the
                    night. Then they could not have been put out.
            
            I was one of the spies that had dogged the steps of the army to give the Prophet information every
                    day. I saw all the arrangement of the camp. It was not made where the Indians wanted it. The place
                    was very bad for the attack. But it was not that which caused the failure. It was because General
                    Harrison changed horses. He had ridden a grey one every day on the march, and he could have been
                    shot twenty times by scouts that were hiding along the route. That was not what was wanted, until
                    the army got to a place where it could be all wiped out. That time had now come, and the hundred
                    braves were to rush in and shoot the "Big chief on a white horse," and then fall
                    back to a safer place.
            This order was fully obeyed, but we soon found to our terrible dismay that the "Big chief on
                    a white horse" that was killed was not General Harrison. He had mounted a dark horse. I
                    know this, for I was so near that I saw him, and I knew him as well as I knew my own brother.
            I think that I could then have shot him, but I could not lift my gun. The Great Spirit held it down.
                    I knew then that the great white chief was not to be killed, and I knew that the red men were
                    doomed.
            As soon as daylight came our warriors saw that the Prophet's grand plan had
                    failed–that the great white chief was alive riding fearlessly among his troops in spite
                    of bullets, and their hearts melted.
            After that the Indians fought to save themselves, not to crush the whites. It was a terrible defeat.
                    Our men all scattered and tried to get away. The white horsemen chased them and cut them down with
                    long knives. We carried off a few wounded prisoners in the first attack, but nearly all the dead lay
                    unscalped, and some of them lay thus till the next year when another army came to bury them.
            Our women and children were in the town only a mile from the battle-field waiting for victory and its
                    spoils. They wanted white prisoners. The Prophet had promised that every squaw of any note should
                    have one of the white warriors to use as her slave, or to treat as she pleased.
            Oh how these women were disappointed! Instead of slaves ahd spoils of the white men coming into town
                    with the rising sun, their town was in flames and women and children were  hunted like wolves and killed by hundreds or driven into the river and
                    swamps to hide.
            With the smoke of that town and the loss of that battle I lost all hope of the red men being able to
                    stop the whites.
            I fought that day by the side of an old 
                        Ottawa
                     chief and his son, the brother of my wife. We were in the advance party, and several of
                    those nearest to me fell by the bullets or blows of two horsemen who appeared to be proof against
                    our guns. At length one of these two men killed the young man and wounded the old chief, and at the
                    same time I brought him and his horse to the ground. The horse ran, before he fell, down the bluff
                    into the creek, quite out of the way of the whites. The man's leg was broken and he had
                    another bad wound. I could have taken his scalp easily, but Sabaqua, the old chief, begged me not to
                    kill him. He wanted to take him to his wife alive, in place of her son whom the white brave had
                    killed.
            I was willing enough to do this for I always respected a brave man, and this one was, beside, the
                    handsomest white man I had ever seen. I knew him as soon as I saw him closely. I had seen him
                    before. I went to 
                        Vincennes
                     only one moon before the battle as a spy. I told the governor that I came for peace.
                    This young man was there and I talked with him. He was not one of the warriors but had come because
                    he was a great brave. He had told me, laughingly, that he would come to see me at my wigwam. I
                    thought now that he should do it. I caught a horse–there were plenty of them that had
                    lost their riders–and mounted the white brave with Sabaqua behind him to hold him on and
                    started them off north. I was then sure that we should all have to run that way as soon as it was
                    light. The Indians were defeated. The great barrier was broken. It was my last fight. I put my body
                    in the way. It was strong then, but it was not strong enough to stop the white men. They pushed it
                    aside as I do this stick. I have never seen the place since where we fought that night. My heart was
                    very big then. Tecumseh had filled it with gall. It has been empty ever since.2

                        163–184, journals of Judge Isaac Naylor and Col. John Tipton. The account is also
                        printed in the Report of the Tippecanoe Monument Commission, by Alva O. Reser,
                        1909.
            
            
            Solon Robinson gives the following account of Tecumseh's return, in Me-Won-I-Toc:
            
            This chieftain was in 
                        Georgia
                     or 
                        Florida
                     at the time of the battle and knew nothing of it or its results until late in the
                    winter. He did not meet with the success that he had hoped for upon his mission and he returned sad
                    and dispirited with the little body-guard that accompanied him on his trip south. He crossed the
                        Ohio river near Shawneetown and kept up the edge of the Grand prairie, thus
                    avoiding all the settlements on the 
                        Wabash
                    . Opposite the point where the river bends eastward from its general north and south
                    course, the party struck off east and crossed over to the south side of the river to visit some
                    friends at Shawnee prairie. [He crossed the Wabash river at the
                        Baltimore hill, north of 
                        Covington
                    , at what is now known as the Bend.]
            It was night when they crossed the army trail, or Tecumseh would have read in it the explanation why
                    he did not find his friends where he expected to meet them. He thought that for some reason the
                    Prophet had called in the scattering families, concentrating them around his town. He did not dream
                    of the great disaster that had fallen upon that town. He did not look about him the next day with
                    the usual sagacity of an Indian, who reads a long history in a few little signs such as a white man
                    might pass unnoticed. He arrived after dark in the evening on the site of the Prophet's
                    town, without having met a single soul to give him any information. His heart had begun to misgive
                    him. How it must have sank down to the zero of despair when he neither saw a light nor heard one
                    sound of life, where but a few months before he had left such a stirring community.
            "In a single moment," as he afterward told Shobonier, "I realized that I
                    was a ruined man. My mission to my mother's native land and her brothers had failed. I
                    could not induce them to come where the water turns to stone and the rain comes from the clouds in
                    showers of white wool and buries every green thing out of sight. I had shut my eyes all the way so
                    as not to see the beautiful country that would soon be trampled under the feet of the hated white
                    men. I was going from a sunny clime to one of ice and snow, and I thought that although it might lie
                    deep and cold upon the roof of my wigwarn,  I should find a warm
                    fire within. And that thought kept me warm through all the. chilly nights of that long journey. If I
                    was hungry, I said I can bear it, for I know that my people on the 
                        Wabash
                     have plenty of corn, and my friends, the English, give them great stores of cloth,
                    blankets, guns and powder for their furs. But when I came to this land of plenty and looked for my
                    warm home and my young wife to welcome me, I heard no voice and saw nothing but darkness. Then my
                    heart was black. I knew at once the cause of all this desolation. I saw the marks of the great white
                    general that I had defied in his own council house, in every blackened brand of the burned town. I
                    stood upon the ashes of my own home, where my own wigwam had sent up its fire to the Great Spirit,
                    and there I summoned the spirits of the braves who had fallen in their vain attempt to protect their
                    homes from the grasping invader, and as I snuffed up the smell of their blood from the ground I
                    swore once more eternal hatred–the hatred of an avenger. I am now going to strike these
                    foes. Will my red brethren go with me?"
            A few went, not all, for the charm that had held them fast to the great chief was broken. He might
                    swear vengeance over his ruined wigwam and all the homes of his people, but he could not wipe out
                    the blood of that battle-field, nor heal the festering wounds of a hundred disabled warriors. Nor
                    could he regain his lost prestige. If in a single moment he realized that he was a ruined man, he
                    continued to realize it all his life.
            He no longer declared that Elskatawwa was a Prophet and possessed of supernatural powers and
                    knowledge. He called him by a most degrading epithet, that means far more than
                    "fool."
            The next summer after the battle of 
                        Tippecanoe
                    , war was declared between the 
                        United States
                     and 
                        England
                    , and then Tecumseh appeared in a new character–a brigadier general in the
                    British service, and commander-in-chief of all the Indian allies of that power. He fought a severe
                    battle at Fort Meigs, 
                        Ohio
                    , May 5, 1812, and another, perfectly desperate, at the Moravian Towns, on the
                        River Thames, 
                        Canada
                    , in the Autumn of 1813, where he laid down his life fighting for his country, and to
                    avenge wrongs which he felt had been inflicted upon him by the Americans.
            
            He was still a young man at the time of his death, strong and hearty, well-formed in body, limb and
                    features. His height was about five feet ten inches and always erect.
         
         
         
            Historical News
            By JOHN W. OLIVER
            
            The fall meeting of the Indiana Southwestern historical society was held October 11 in 
                        Rockport
                    . The meeting was the largest in the history of the "pocket"
                    organization, more than 300 persons being present. Mrs. Calder D. Ehrman, vice-president of the 
                        Spencer County
                     historical society, was chairman of the committee on arrangements, and no detail had
                    been overlooked to make the meeting an interesting one, both from the standpoint of the program and
                    from the standpoint of entertainment to the numerous visitors. 
                        Rockport
                     only recently dedicated its new courthouse, a model from the architectural standpoint,
                    in which the historical society meeting was held.
            Judge John E. Iglehart, president of the society, made a talk in which he outlined the nature of the
                    historical work being conducted by the eight counties in southwestern Indiana. He laid special
                    emphasis on the importance of compiling the biographical history of the early leaders in that
                    section of the state. A paper on "Old Gilead Church and the Rev. Charles Polk" was
                    read by Thomas J. de la Hunt of 
                        Cannelton
                    . Mrs. Kate Milner Rabb made a talk on "
                        Spencer County
                     During the Fifties." An outline of the historical work that is being conducted
                    throughout the state was presented by John W. Oliver, and the "pocket counties"
                    were urged to take the lead in this special work, which the Indiana historical commission is now
                    promoting.
            Following the historical program, the visitors were tendered a pioneer reception by Mr. and Mrs. A.
                    J. Cook, who had fitted up a two room pioneer cabin, which was filled with interesting historical
                    relics. A special display of Lincoln relics had been arranged, and among others was an old cupboard
                    made for Elizabeth Crawford by Thomas and Abraham Lincoln during their residence in 
                        Spencer county
                    . The old cupboard now belongs to a descendant, Mrs. Charles F. Brown. Beside the
                    fire-place sat Mrs. Margaret Wright, ninety-one years old, the grand-daughter of Daniel Grass, one
                    of 
                        Spencer county
                    's  first settlers. A spinning wheel which
                    belonged to James A. Gentry, Sr., and which had been in the family for more than two hundred years,
                    was another relic that caught the visitor's eye. Col. James S. Wright, ninety years old,
                    colonel of the 25th Indiana volunteers, reported as the only living colonel in Indiana who went out
                    and came back with his regiment, was also present, and greeted the visitors. The first marriage
                    record of 
                        Spencer county
                    , dated 1818, a license for Aaron Grigsby to Sarah Lincoln, an old paper printed in
                    1800, a poster bed 104 years old, a brick-mould used by Abraham Lincoln when he helped lay the
                    bricks for the first church built in Gentryville, and numerous other relics were on display.
            A souvenir, distributed during the meeting as a reminder of Lincoln's residence in the city,
                    was a page from the book of the Pigeon Baptist church near Gentryville, to which Thomas Lincoln
                    belonged, and which showed the day in June, 1828, on which Lincoln "now joined by
                    letter." Seventy-six new members from 
                        Spencer county
                     were added to the Southwestern Indiana historical society. An excellent collection of
                    historical relics has been installed in the 
                        Spencer county
                     courthouse, and rooms have been provided permanently for the county historical society
                    in which the relics will be kept on exhibit.
            The annual meeting of the 
                        Lake County
                     historical society, and Old Settlers reunion was held in 
                        Crown Point
                    , August 27, 1921, attended by the largest crowd in the history of the organization. The
                    newspapers report that more than three thousand people were present. During the afternoon program, a
                    marker erected on the site of the homestead of Solon Robinson, first settler in 
                        Crown Point
                    , was dedicated. A. F. Knotts of Gary read a paper on the "Life of Solon
                    Robinson," pioneer, abolitionist, advocate of prohibition and women suffragist.
            Solon Robinson, who is said to have been the founder of 
                        Crown Point
                     and 
                        Lake county
                    , was born in 
                        Connecticut
                    , October 21, 1803. He moved to 
                        Jennings county
                    , Indiana, about 1830 and in 1834 settled as a "squatter" in what is

                        Lake county
                    , Indiana. In 1837, he began contributing articles to the Cultivator,
                    published at 
                        Albany
                    , N.Y., and in the early forties he began to write for the 
                        New York
                    
                    Tribune. In 1841, he originated the National agricultural s'ociety at 
                        Washington
                    ,.  D.C. In 1850, he become editor of the
                    agricultural department of the 
                        New York
                    
                    Tribune and was associated with Horace Greeley and Charles A. Dana, which position
                    he held until his death at 
                  Jacksonville, Florida
               , November 3, 1880. He was the author of
                    a number of books, including The Will, Man-irto-woc and The Last of
                        the Buffalo, which were written when he lived at 
                        Crown Point
                    . A copy of the address read by Mr. Knotts together with portraits of Robinson and a
                    picture of the early home in 
                        Lake county
                    , have been filed in the Indiana state library.
            The Indiana historical commission was specifically authorized by the last session of the state
                    legislature to co-operate with local and county historical societies, and with patriotic societies
                    in the movement to erect markers and tablets on historic sites and spots in Indiana, Representatives
                    of several organizations interested in preserving local history, and in marking historic sites, were
                    called together in the office of the Historical commission on Friday afternoon, September 30, and a
                    definite program was agreed upon which will be followed throughout the state. The Historical
                    commission will issue a bulletin within the near future which will give, county by county, a list of
                    all historic sites and spots within the state that have been marked. This is only a preliminary step
                    to the larger campaign that will be inaugurated throughout the state, calling attention to the
                    numerous sites and spots that should be designated by appropriate markers. The Historical commission
                    will co-operate with each community in the work of selecting sites and spots of historical value,
                    and will advise with the local committees in charge as to the nature of the tablet, boulder or
                    monument that should be used in designing the local historical event.
            A bronze memorial tablet marking the spot where Henry Clay delivered his famous address, October 1,
                    1842, at the corner of North A and 7th streets, 
                        Richmond
                    , Indiana, was dedicated, October 14, 1921. The Kiwanis club of 
                        Richmond
                     presented the granite boulder to which a bronze tablet containing the following
                    inscription was affixed: 
                        On October 1, 1842, in what was then an open tract in this city square, Henry Clay, the
                            leader of the Whig party, delivered an address to an immense multitude, and Hiram
                            Mendenhall, a 
                                Quaker
                             Abolitionist,  presented to him on behalf
                            of the Indiana Anti-Slavery Society, a numerously signed petition, asking his to free his
                            slaves. 
                                Clay
                            , in an eloquent reply, criticized this act as a breach of hospitality,
                            described the difficulties and perils of immediate emancipation and advised Mendenhall to
                            begin his work of benevolence at home.
                        
                     
                                Clay
                            's rejoinder was then overwhelmingly applauded, yet the incident was
                            afterwards an important factor in the growth of the Liberty party; in the defeat of 
                                Clay
                             for the presidency in 1844; and in the spread of an anti-slavery sentiment,
                            which contributed to the dissolution of the Whig party, the organization of the Republican
                            party and finally to the Civil war and ultimate emancipation.
                    
                
            Addresses were made by William Dudley Foulke and Professor Harlow Lindley of Earlham college.
            
                    Just 100 years ago the 
                            Bloomington
                         firm of Seward & Company, iron foundry, was organized and has been
                        continuously in business here ever since. It is probably the oldest business in the state which
                        has continued under the same firm name and by direct descendants of the same family for 100
                        years. The business was started by Austin Seward, who came to 
                            Bloomington
                        , September 14, 1821, and immediately set up a log cabin shop near the public
                        square. A brick building, a part of which is still standing, soon afterward was erected on the
                        same site. The concern has passed through the hands of four generations and is now conducted by
                        Fred and Austin Seward, graduates of Indiana university.

            The Indiana Historical commission, co-operating with the division of geology of the department of
                    conservation, is conducting an archeological and historical survey of Indiana, county by county.
                    Blue print maps of each county are being prepared and a special questionnaire issued by the two
                    departments are supplied to the counties which undertake the survey. Included in the archeological
                    list of material will be found a reference to mounds, earthworks, enclosures, specimens and
                    collections, descriptions of which are to be given as to size, shape and state of preservation. The
                    exact location is to be noted and charts, pictures and drawings are to be made of the mounds and of
                    the remains. Also the earliest settlements within the county, sites of historic buildings, old
                    cemeteries, boundary lines, birthplaces of noted people, markers, old trails, trade routes, and
                    other points of historical interest will be designated on the map. The historical material called
                    for includes a list of old books, diaries, ledgers, letters, newspapers, historic documents,
                    pamphlets, and other sources of  state and local history. It
                    will require two or three, or even perhaps four, years to complete the survey of the entire state,
                    but when the counties have made a careful examination of their historical and archeological
                    material, Indiana will then be in possession of the first and only systematic survey that has been
                    made of its rich archeological remains and historical records. The survey has already been started
                    in 
                        Ripley
                    , Jefferson, Johnson and Owen counties.
            The 
                        Allen County
                     historical society recently unearthed what is believed to be an old Indian battle
                    ground some sixteen miles north of 
                        Fort Wayne
                     in Smith township, about one mile across the 
                        Allen county
                     line from Eel River township. On the brow of a hill rising above
                        Eel river is what appears to be the ruins of a circular stockade some
                    thirty feet in circumference. Opinions have been advanced by the members of the society that Chief
                    Little Turtle used this place for protection and stored his supplies there. Another theory is that
                    the massacre of LeBalme, an early French cavalry officer who served with the American army occurred
                    here in 1780. LeBalme and his followers were on their way to 
                        Detroit
                     to capture this place after the capture of 
                        Vincennes
                     by George Rogers Clark. Further explorations of the mound are being made.
            
               
                        Wabash county
                     claims the honor of having the oldest pioneer society of any county in Indiana. The
                    society was organized October 30, 1870, at which time Elijah Hackelman, president, and John L.
                    Knight, secretary, were elected. An article appeared in the 
                        Wabash
                    
                    Times-Star, August 11, 1921, in which a description of the first meeting was
                    given, relating the account given by Major Stearns Fisher of his journey to 
                        Wabash county
                     in 1843, when there were only twelve white families living in the county. The
                    membership in the pioneer society during this first year numbered 244 persons. In 1909 the society
                    erected a Lincoln centennial log cabin in the city park, and the logs used in the cabin were first
                    used in an old cabin constructed by one John Correll in Liberty township in 1848. In the cabin
                    numerous relics possessing historical interest and dating back to the first families in 
                        Wabash county
                     are to be found.
            The Society of Indiana pioneers selected the historic city of 
                        Vincennes
                     as the object of its annual fall pilgrimage in October.  1921. A special car was placed at the disposal of the society, and upon
                    arriving in 
                        Vincennes
                    , a reception committee met the society and conducted them through the city, pointing
                    out the places and buildings of historic interest, and visits were made to the historic spots and to
                    the Harrison home. The Society of Indiana pioneers is doing much to stimulate interest in pioneer
                    history, and its historical pilgrimages always awaken an interest in the community visited.
            The 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    
                    Press, September 22, 1921, issued a Beecher club edition in memory of Henry Ward
                    Beecher, who began his ministry in that historic town in May, 1837. The Beecher club consists of a
                    young men's Bible class in 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    , organized to keep alive the name and honor of Henry Ward Beecher. The interesting
                    issue of the Press for September 22 contains several biographical sketches of
                    Henry Ward Beecher, a history and picture of 
                        Hanover
                     college which received much support from Mr. Beecher, an article by Vice-President
                    Thomas R. Marshall on the "Duty of the Church," an article by the editor, D. Paul
                    Ziegler giving a history of "Journalism in Indiana," an article on "James
                    B. Eads," one of the world's greatest engineers, referred to as the master of the
                    Father of Waters, and an article on the public schools of 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    . Pictures of the Presbyterian church where Beecher began his ministry, the tomb of
                    William Henry Harrison at 
                  North Bend, Ohio
               , not far from 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    , the first Presbyterian church in 
                        Aurora
                    , organized April 14, 1844, the Tousey house erected in 1820 by Captain Samuel C. Vance,
                    and a picture of the old 
                        Dearborn county
                     courthouse, were included in this edition.
            On Tuesday, October 11,1921, the Ouiatenon club of Craw-fordsville, numbering fifty members, headed
                    by Prof. Lawrence H. Gipson, made a trip to the site of the old fort, four miles south of 
                        Lafayette
                    , and held an historical meeting. Alva 0. Reser, president of the 
                        Tippecanoe County
                     historical society, presided at the meeting, and a paper was read by Dr. John N.
                    Taylor, of 
                        Crawfordsville
                     on "A Glimpse of Old Fort Ouiatenon in 1719–64." After
                    giving a history of Fort Ouiatenon during the French and English colonial period, Dr. Taylor made a
                    plea for setting aside the site of the fort as a state  park,
                    and suggests that it be connected with the 
                        Tippecanoe
                     Battle Ground near 
                        Lafayette
                    .
            Not often is it permitted a man to serve continuously as a minister of the same church for fifty
                    years. But this unusual honor has come to Dr. Charles Little, pastor of the Presbyterian church in 
                        Wabash
                    , Indiana, who on November 6 started upon his fiftieth year of the ministry in the same
                    church. Dr. Little was born December 1, 1845, at 
                  Granville, Ohio
               . After
                    studying in Dennison university, Marietta college, and in the Lane Theological seminary in 
                        Cincinnati
                    , he came to 
                        Wabash
                    , Indiana, in November, 1872, at which place he has since resided continuously. Dr.
                    Little served as clerk of the state synod for twenty years, and was one time moderator of the
                    national general assembly.
            On August 21, the Ninth annual community meeting of Pierceville, 
                        Ripley county
                    , co-operating with the newly organized 
                        Ripley County
                     historical society, held an all-day program on the Pierceville school grounds. Among
                    the historical papers read was one by Mrs. Grace A. Robinson on "Colonel
                    Laugh-rey"; a paper by Carl E. Wood of 
                        Indianapolis
                     on "The Early History of 
                        Ripley County
                    ", with special reference to the late Stephen S. Harding, and a paper by W. D.
                    Robinson on "Arend H. Meyer", who endowed the Prattsburg school of 
                        Franklin
                     township with $1,000 to enable the school to prolong its sessions over the
                    prescribed minimum fixed by law. An attendance of over one thousand people was reported.
            On October 22, a statute of Major General Henry W. Law-ton was unveiled at Lakeside park in 
                        Fort Wayne
                    . The statute, which is the work of Frederick Cleveland Hibbard of 
                        Chicago
                    , is ten and one-half feet high and is mounted on a solid block of Mt. Airy granite. On
                    the reverse side of the base of the monument is a bronze tablet bearing the following inscription:

            General Lawton was born March 1, 1843, and, when still an infant, came to 
                        Allen county
                     from 
                        Ohio
                     with his parents, who erected a log cabin in a little clearing. It was from this home
                    that Lawton at the age of eighteen enlisted in the Union army in 1861. As another tribute to his
                    memory, a movement has been started to purchase and preserve this old cabin home.
            A 
                        Clinton County
                     historical society was organized September 23, 1921, with the following officers:
                    president, Dr. Charles A. Zinn; vice-president, Miss Laura Bayless; secretary, Jerome Epstein;
                    treasurer, J. F. Dreyer. The executive committee consists of D. F. Maish, Mrs. H. C. Sheridan, and
                    Mrs. R. N. Wallace. The week preceding the organization of the county historical society, one of the
                    most interesting relic exhibits ever displayed in Indiana took place in 
                        Frankfort
                    . The movement was sponsored by the 
                        Frankfort
                    
                    Daily Times, under the direction of Ed. N. Thacker and Max Fowler. A collection of
                    historical relics was brought together which has not been surpassed in any city within the state.
                    The merchants of 
                        Frankfort
                     donated their show windows for an entire week to a display of these relics, and upon
                    invitation from the 
                        Frankfort
                    
                    Times, citizens from four corners of the county brought from out their hiding
                    places relics and mementos which when assembled formed a museum difficult to equal. More than a
                    thousand individual relics were on exhibit for an entire week, and the interest in this display
                    brought several thousand visitors to the city. Plans for making an intensive membership drive and
                    for the erection of a public building for the county historical society and museum purposes have
                    been made in 
                        Clinton county
                    .
            The annual meeting of the 
                        Brookville
                     historical society was held on Labor day, September 5, 1921, at the Little Cedar
                    Baptist church. An all day program was carried out which included a picnic dinner, a trip to the

                    State historical commission, Dr. E. E. Booth of 
                        Cincinnati
                    , both of whom were natives of 
                        Franklin county
                    . Both of the speakers emphasized the importance of interesting school children in the
                    subject of local history and of compiling and preserving the rich history of 
                        Franklin county
                     before it is forgotten.

            Down in that part of the state known as the Gore another county has taken its place in the list of
                    counties with newly organized historical societies. October 13, the 
                        Dearborn County

                        Dearborn County
                     historical society was due to the efforts of the twelve members of the Indiana
                    historical society now credited to that county.
            
               
                        Jennings county
                     has to its credit a new state park, ten members in the Indiana historical society, and
                    a local historical society. A renewal of interest in local history was the outcome of the visit of

                    Canyon Club picnic held in the McCormick's Creek state park. At that meeting sixteen of
                    those present signified their willingness to become members of a society organized for the purpose
                    of collecting and preserving local history. Mr. 0. E. Dunn, a descendant of the second settled in
                    the county, was elected president. He also has the further distinction of representing the counties
                    of 
                        Clay

                    R. L. Beem, was appointed. It is the purpose of the society to increase this committee by adding one
                    member from each township. A program was planned for the next meeting to be held at the home of Mrs.
                    Louise Cochrane, October 28.

                        Henry county
                    . Pursuant to this announcement an all-day program was given, consisting of
                    reminiscences, the singing of old-time songs, the reading of papers appropriate to such a theme, and
                    a picnic dinner. An exhibit of gowns, manuscripts and other articles of historical interest was
                    arranged in addition to the exhibits already housed in the building. A representative and
                    enthusiastic audience, in which all parts of the county were represented, filled the rooms of the
                    building to over-flowing. The home of the society is owned by the county, and is the only home so
                    owned in the state. As a centennial memorial of real value to the work of the historical society in
                    the future, a member of the county council of 
                        Henry county
                     announced that acting under the authority given to that body by the legislature of
                    1921, an appropriation had been made providing sufficient funds for the employment of an all-time
                    curator, and the improvement of the home of the society so as to make it a real educational center

                    has placed itself in the lead in the work of local historical societies. All hail to the 
                        Henry County
                     historical society!
            Under the direction of the Indiana historical commission many of the counties in the state have
                    prepared and published a comprehensive history of the part their citizens played in the World war.
                    The county war history committees include in their reports records of the men who entered service, a
                    report of the activities of the county council of defense, the selective service boards, the liberty
                    loan drives, the Red Cross work and all other organizations that actively participated in war work.
                    More than 60 of the 92 counties have completed their work, and the other 32 counties are expected to
                    prepare their reports within the next year.

                        United States
                     has a more complete collection of war history records than the one prepared under Miss
                    Wilson's direction for 
                        Dubois county
                    .
            Major David I. McCormick, superintendent of the Indiana Battle Flag commission, has completed a
                    catalogue of the flags in the state house. These flags were carried by Indiana organizations in the
                    Mexican, Civil and Spanish American wars. There are 166 national colors and 142 regimental colors,
                    81 of which have been incased and are on exhibit on the fourth floor of the state house. The
                    remaining flags have been stored carefully in the basement. It is hoped that all may be on exhibit
                    at some time in the proposed War Memorial building. Major McCormick is now making a search for any
                    flags which still remain in private hands. Also he is getting from the contemporary newspapers and
                    from the soldiers themselves any stories which relate to particular flags.
            Mrs. Edna B. Felter, the former state regent of the D. A. R., has placed in the Indiana state library
                    reports for 1919–1920 and 1920–1921 and also the secretary's book
                    which contains the minutes of the meetings of the Indiana chapter of the D. A. R. from 1901 to date.
            The 100th anniversary of the founding of the Meridian Street M. E. church in 
                        Indianapolis
                     was fittingly celebrated by a two day centennial program on Sunday and Monday, October
                    30 and 31, 1921. Dr. Frank B. Wynn, representing the Indiana historical commission, read a paper in
                    which he traced the growth of the church from the date of its first meeting in a rude log cabin,
                    erected on the spot near where the state house now stands, on down to the present day. Church
                    centennials are occurring with increasing frequency throughout Indiana, and the history of these
                    religious institutions adds much to the state's collection of historical material.
            DANIEL WAIT HOWE (October 24,
                    1838–October 28, 1921)
            Daniel Wait Howe, president of the Indiana historical society from 1901 to 1920, Civil war veteran
                    and writer of  Indiana history, died at his home in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , October 28, 1921. Mr. Howe was born in 
                  Patriot, Switzerland county
               , Indiana,
                    October 24, 1838, the son of Daniel Haven and Lucy Hicks Howe. He was the descendant of one of the
                    oldest and most prominent families in our early history. He was educated in 
                        Franklin
                     college where he graduated with the class of 1857. He served in the Civil war,
                    participated in the battle of Carrick's Ford, Stone's River,
                    Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, the East 
                        Tennessee
                     and 
                        Atlanta
                     campaigns. He rose to the rank of captain. In 1867 he graduated from the 
                        Albany
                     law school of 
                        New York
                    . In 1873 he came to 
                        Indianapolis
                     and three years later was elected judge of the Superior court, where he served for
                    fourteen years. He was elected president of the Indiana historical society in 1901, was a member of
                    the 
                        New England
                     historical-genealogical society, and was once the president of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     bar association. He was the author of 
                  
                            Puritan
                         Republic, published in 1899, and Civil War Times, published
                    in 1902.
            JOHN HAMPDEN HOLLIDAY (May 31,
                    1846–October 20, 1921)
            John Hampden Holliday, son of Rev. William A. and Lucia Shaw Holliday, philanthropist, editor and
                    banker, died at his home in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , October 20, 1921. Few men have done more to promote a study and interest in the
                    subject of Indiana history than did Mr. Holliday. It was he who rescued from the possessions of John
                    B. Dillon, after the latter's death, the journals of John Tipton, one of the rarest
                    historical documents in our state archives. Mr. Holliday was the first to publish these journals. He
                    was long a member of the Indiana historical society, the chief sponsor of the society of Indiana
                    pioneers, as well as its president, up until the time of his death. As editor of the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    News, and the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Press it was part of his policy to give generous space to historical articles and
                    new items possessing historical interest. Many of the historical feature articles which he sponsored
                    in the newspapers of which he was the editor have since found their way into the historical
                    literature of the state as part of its permanent collection. Splendid descriptions of pioneer life
                    are found in  the New Purchase; The Pioneer
                        Schools, by D. D. Banta, and from excerpts taken from the Fletcher diaries, all printed by
                    Mr. Holliday's papers. As a collector of books he was most active, and only recently turned
                    over to the Indiana state library a rare collection of his personal books, the largest individual
                    collection that has ever come into the possession of the state.

                    News, Friday, November 25, 1921: George Pence, a veteran examiner for the state
                    board of accounts, has found a law applying to Indiana, when it was only a territory, that made a
                    man working on a road liable to a fine of $1 if he should halt a stranger on the highway
                    and ask him for a drink.

            Mr. Pence, after 3,000 hours of work on his own time, has just completed what is now an extraordinary
                    exhibit in the State library. It consists of ninety-two volumes written in long hand and indexing
                    the laws specifically applicable to counties from territorial times to 1852 when the present
                    constitution was adopted. In those days the legislature enacted all kinds of special laws providing
                    how specific and individual things should be done in counties. For instance, Mr. Pence found where
                    the legislature authorized about 100 couples to obtain divorces. But nowhere did he find a law so
                    destructive of the personal rights of a liberty loving people as the one prohibiting a man working
                    on the road on a hot, dusty day from stopping a galloping traveler to ask:
            "Brother, would you gimme a drink?"

                        United States
                    . Comparatively few citizens of Indiana know how well these orders are represented in
                    Indiana or the importance of the work they have done and are doing.

            During the early years there lived in 
                        Washington county

                    were nearly all southerners, their average height was about six feet, their weight about 250 and
                    their strength remarkable. The tallest man in the Union army according to the story was one of this
                    group, Capt. David V. Buskirk, 8214 inches in stocking feet. It is an interesting story far out of
                    the ordinary.

                    , 1921.
            This volume is made up of two parts; the first consisting of six lectures delivered by Judge David D.
                    Banta, on successive Foundation days from 1889–1894. These have previously been published
                    in the Indiana Alumni Quarterly, beginning with the first issue of the magazine,
                    January, 1914. The second part is an account of the series of addresses delivered at the Centennial
                    Educational conference, held at Indiana university, May 5–7, 1920, including the address
                    delivered by  Jacob G. Schurman on Foundation day, January 20,
                    1920, together with an account of the Centennial commencement. The first one hundred pages of the
                    volume deal with the growth and early development of the university, from its beginning in 1820,
                    through its transformation into the Universtiy (1832–1838), and the final safeguarding of
                    its endowment by a constitutional provision in 1850. The first period of the university was the
                    seminary, 1820-'28. As early as 1816 an act of congress provided for a "seminary
                    of learning" and the many difficulties in obtaining professors, and the trials of the few
                    students are related. In 1828 by a legislative enactment the seminary was raised to the dignity of a
                    college to meet the needs of a growing community. After a few months of anxiety on the part of the
                    founders of the college, Dr. Andrew Wylie accepted the presidency. The fourth lecture is concerned
                    with the "Faculty War of 1832," which finally resulted in the employment of a
                    number of new professors. The fifth lecture deals with the last stages of transformation, by which
                    the college became the university. The sixth and last lecture in the first part of the volume,
                    explains the changes brought about by President Wylie. All of the lectures are written in an
                    entertaining style, containing personal references to former professors and anecdotes of interest to
                    students and graduates of the school. The first address in the second part is "The American
                    University: Today and Tomorrow," by J. G. Schurman. Although a scholarly discourse, setting
                    forth the highest ideals of a university, it contains too much of the idea of a selective training
                    for the exceptional. Of the eleven addresses published, which were delivered at the Educational
                    conference, one of the most clear-cut and suggestive was, "The University and its Service
                    to Business," by Evans Woolen. He sets forth the main purpose of the State university as
                    follows: first, to train men of character to think, and second, to develop in them a habit of work.
                    Other papers in this volume are: "Researches on Spirocleacta Pallida," by Aldred
                    S. Warthin; "The University Medical School and the State," by A. S. Warthin;
                    "Graduate Medical Education, Expereince with the 
                        Minnesota
                     Plan," by Elisa P. Lyon; "The Thomas Jefferson Theory of
                    Education," by Samuel M. Ralston; "The State University at the Opening  of the Twentieth Century," by Edward A. Birge; "The
                    Functions of the State University," by Paul Shorey; "The Obligation of the State
                    toward Scientific Research," by Roscoe Pound; "A Present Need in American
                    Professional Education," by Robert A. Millikan; "Spiritual Frontiersmen,"
                    by Francis J. McConnell and "The Spiritual Ideal of the University," by Sir Robert
                    Alexander Falconer. This latter part of the volume, unlike the first, deals with topics of general
                    interest, outlining the broad underlying principles of the relations of a State university to such
                    professions as law, medicine and business. The last fifty pages of the book give a detailed account
                    of the Centennial commencement, written by Ivy L. Chamness. It closes with a fitting address by
                    Doctor Bryan to the Senior class. It is scarcely conceivable that such a valuable volume, the only
                    one of its kind published by the university, should have neither title page, nor index. The paper is
                    poor and the binding worse.

                        Topeka
                    , 1920, pp. 235.
            This is a personal account of the writer's life in 
                        Kansas
                     from 1855–1872. Shalor Winchell Eldridge, a native of Southhampton, 
                        Massachusetts
                    , left his home for 
                        Kansas
                     in the early days of the struggle. He was a free state man of sterling character and a
                    great leader in the 
                        Kansas
                     movement. He settled with his family in 
                        Kansas City
                     where he took charge of the American House. He concealed several free state men for
                    months. Among them, was Governor Andrew H. Reeder, whom he protected at the danger of his life and
                    that of his family. He aided Reeder in making his escape out of 
                        Kansas
                    . He removed his family to Lawrence for a year as the society there was more congenial
                    to them than the border ruffian element of 
                        Kansas City
                    . The sacking of Lawrence occurred during their stay. In 1856 Eldridge made a trip to 
                        Washington
                     on a mission to the President, to acquaint him of conditions in 
                        Kansas
                    . He was appointed as one of the delegates to the national Republican convention which
                    met in June at 
                        Philadelphia
                    . He returned  to 
                        Kansas
                     in the late summer with a company of northern emigrants by the 
                        Iowa
                     route. After his return he figured prominently for the free state side in the Lecompton
                    movement and the first free state legislature. He tells his experience In a very graphic and
                    interesting way. The personal element makes the account more valuable.

               The Owl Sacred Pack of the Fox Indians, Bulletin 72, Smithsonian Institution,
                    Bureau of American Ethnology, By TRUMAN MICHELSON, 
                        Washington
                    , 1921, 83 pages illustrated.
            The text was written by Alfred Kiyana some seven years ago for Dr. Boas and by him placed in the
                    Berlin Museum of Ethnology. It was translated into English by Horace Poweshiek and has been
                    corrected by the editor, Mr. Michelson. Both the original and the translation are printed, in
                    parallel columns. Those interested in the Fox language will find the text one of the best sources of
                    that language extant.
            The text starts out with a description of how the gens festival is conducted; it will be noticed that
                    there is mostly dancing and smoking of the Catlinite pipe which every one
                    uses–"even a child, or a woman is given a smoke–all maidens, little
                    girls, men, youths, boys." After the word "o'no id tci" was
                    pronounced all conversation ceases and all sit quietly. One reads an account of the winter festival
                    at which time there is dancing and the bones are taken and "thrown at the foot of an oak
                    tree on the north side where no sunlight will strike."
            In a brief description of the ceremony preceding a war party, we read of the various war songs,
                    dances, their eating and their medicinal and wailing songs.
            The proceedings of the warrior, who is now on the warpath, is given; the marvelous powers of the
                    medicine in the sacred pack in causing death, and the effect that the flute has upon the enemy who
                    "would be unable to move" are recorded. "The heads of the enemy would
                    continue to be cut off while they were still alive." If the enemy made a sudden assault, or
                    if the enemy is attempting escape, instructions are given: wide rivers can be made narrow and again
                    wide by the mystic powers hidden in the sacred pack.
            
            Now as to what happened to the one blessed. It is said that "Black Rainbow" was his
                    name. And his niece was named "Deer-Horn" so it is said. They were both blessed
                    together. An account of their meeting the owl is given and we read of the blessings which the owl
                    bestowed upon "Black Rainbow:" he will be able to wade a deep and wide river, and
                    if any one is wounded he will be able to heal them. Elaborate explanations came next. The one
                    blessed will "instruct those who will take care of the sacred pack in the future."
            A gens festival is held. The virtue of the sacred pack is revealed by those who had poor eyesight and
                    they were made to have good eyesight. And those who had various diseases were led around in a circle
                    four times. After they had been led around four times they were healed. More elaborate instructions
                    followed.
            Black-Rainbow and his niece Deer-Horn were captured by the Sioux. Black-Rainbow used his power upon
                    them making them beat his drum. Many a Sioux came. All were captured. All were killed but one woman
                    who was sent home to tell the story of this capture. A captured Sioux warrior was sent home to
                    narrate the same story. The last episode is the turning to granite of both Black-Rainbow and
                    Deer-Horn.

                     Historical Commission, Raleigh, N. C, 1921, pp. 486.
            The Manual is printed every two years by the 
                        North Carolina
                     Historical Commission and is used to furnish in compact form information about the
                    state and its government and institutions. Similar manuals were issued by the state in 1903, 1905
                    and 1907, after which the historical commission took over the work of publication. The work of the
                    state is taken up in the manual under the following heads, Legislative department; Executive
                    department; Judicial department; Administrative department, Boards and Commissions, State
                    educational institutions and State charitable institutions. A complete official register for the
                    year 1921 is given and, as is the custom, the senators and representatives along with the governor
                         are given publicity thru the section devoted to
                    biographical sketches. The editor has compiled a very helpful and handy reference concerning the
                    election returns both for the state and nation. The platforms of the leading political parties are
                    set forth along with a copy of the Declaration of Independence and state and national constitutions.
                    The editor has in a complete yet concise way presented reports of all the branches of government of
                    the state and has included some new material of value. The average reader would find the book more
                    easily usable if an index were furnished, on account of the wide difference in the character of the
                    subjects taken up in the book.

                    Of special interest is the catalogue of the soldiers of the Champlain valley,

                    list of the members, with account of  their service. This
                    collection should prove of great value to the descendants is tracing ancestors and by historians as
                    well. Besides these there are fifteen illustrations, the majority being full page ones. Among them

            This is a most valuable document for American history. It lets us into the midst of the 
                        German
                     migration, beginning about 1689 and continuing till well after 1715, which filled up
                    the back country of the 
                  New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia
               , Carolina and 
                        Georgia
                     colonies. The descendants of these 
                        German
                     immigrants form a substantial part of the American population today. Without them one
                    cannot account for the American institutions, especially our social customs. The volume opens with
                    an historical account of the European causes of the 
                        German
                     migration, covering the iirst 100 pages. Graf-fenried was a Swiss, born in 
                        Bern
                    , 11561. He received the A. M. degree at 
                        Cambridge
                     in 1682, shopping that he stood well with the Restoration. He became interested in
                    America and like Penn, 
                        Baltimore
                     and the Carolina grantees sought his fortune by promoting a colony in America. The Account here given is his own of the attempt and failure at 
                        New Bern
                    . He wrote the Account in both French and 
                        German
                    , the various editions differing somewhat. A French version from the library of Iverton, 
                        Switzerland
                    , was translated for the 
                        North Carolina
                     commission and published in Colonial Records of 
                            North Carolina
                        , I, 905. Dr. Goebel har. used other copies and has given us a corrected
                    edition in French, 
                        German
                     and in an English translation. A short vocabula ry or glossary of antiquated or
                    obsolete terms is given to aid in reading the original versions. In scholarship and mechanical
                    workmanship the volume is up to the high standard of the

            This is a fresh book. When one reads in a textbook on 
                        United States
                     history without finding long chapters on Puritanism and Slavery he has a right to be
                    surprised. Still more remarkable there is more about Edward K. Collins in this text than about
                    Daniel Webster; a portrait of 
                        Boone
                     but none of Calhoun. There is a chapter of 20 pages on the Civil War and one of 34
                    pages on Prices and Wages. On the other hand the title Economic History is
                    misleading. There are no technical discussions of economic theory, but a plain story of the people
                    at work. The book is a first class antidote to our present airy, idealistic moral fashion in history
                    without being offensively materialistic. The author divides his subjects into six parts, indicating
                    six periods in our development: the colonial period (to 1763), the New Nation (to 1819), the
                    American System (to 1840), occupation of the west (to 1873), large scale production and competition
                    (to 1893), industrial combination and government regulation. The period since 1873 covered by the
                    last two sections of the text is the most troublesome to the teacher of American history. The author
                    has stated his facts acceptably and described conditions fairly, and avoided dogmatic interpretation
                    on his own part. He very wisely refrains from telling us what the long industrial struggle means and
                    offers no nostrums. The text is well-made and beautifully illustrated. It seems as a school text it
                    will be preferable to the old style politico-military text. At any rate it seems a relief to be free
                    of glory, grandeur and moral platitudes and get down to the ground.
         
         
            
               The Story of a Poet: Madison Cawein. Publication Number 30 of the Filson Club, 
                        Louisville
                    . By OTTO A. ROTHERT. John P. Morton &
                    Co., 
                        Louisville
                    , 1921, pp. 545.
            This is a memorial volume by the secretary of the Filson Club. It is unnecessary to say it is a
                    sumptuous volume. There are 63 half-tone illustrations, nearly all full-page, of the poet himself,
                    his haunts, houses, fancies and friends. His life, occupying about 100 pages, is told by letters,
                    clippings and reminiscences of his associates. Pages 167–329 contain his  letters, the chapter being headed A Posthumous Autobiography. Pages
                    340–353 contain reviews of his books. Pages 353–454 contain reminiscences by a
                    score or so of his friends. The last 90 pages contain a list of his books–36 volumes of
                    poetry, 6 brochures and 8 prose sketches–an index to his books, bibliographical
                    references and an index.
            The poet Cawein was born in 
                        Louisville
                     March 23, 1865, lived with his parents there and at Brownsboro, 20 miles east of 
                        Louisville
                    , till 1876. From 1876 to 1879 the family lived on the Knobs back of 
                        New Albany
                    , Indiana. The father was a physician and patent medicine manufacturer at 
                        Louisville
                    . Here, also, the poet lived till his death, December 8, 1914. There is no serious
                    effort on the part of the author to estimate Mr. Cawein's work. The critics had given him a
                    place in the first rank of American poets before his death. Before his death, 1907, The
                        Poems of Madison Cawein, in five large volumes, had been issued. Since his death no
                    complete or definitive edition of his poems, numbering in all about 1,500, has been printed. The
                    volume is a repository of practically all the biographical data extant on Mr. Cawein's
                    life.
         
         
            
               Art and Artists of Indiana. By MARY Q. BURNETT. (
                        New York
                    , Century Company. 1921. 448 p. $6.00.)
            A most readable and delightful work as well as a valuable contribution to Indiana history has been
                    made by Mrs. Burnet in her book on Indiana artists. The publication shows years of careful and
                    patient research and contains more information on the subject than has ever appeared elsewhere. The
                    author, always interested in art herself, has encouraged the art movement in the state for years.
                    She was state art chairman of the Indiana federation of women's clubs for some time and at
                    present is director of prints in the general federation of women's clubs. Although well
                    qualified to handle the subject critically, she has preferred to treat it historically. As stated in
                    the preface: 
                        The present work is the gathering together of material that will be helpful to the future
                            historian, of things accomplished by the artists who have lived and hoped and struggled in
                            Indiana. No attempt has been made to give a critical analysis of motifs or technique. The
                            artists of Indiana belong to the future, not to the past. Time will prove the value of their
                            work, and coming generations may condemn or approve.
                    
                
            
            The author has included in the work many interesting incidents and biographical notes which give it
                    character and atmosphere.
            The chapter headings are Pioneers and Itinerant artists;

            Probably the most useful part of the book is the addenda of eighty-nine pages. This includes an
                    alphabetical Who's Who in art, giving brief biographies of over three
                    hundred Indiana painters, sculptors and illustrators; the names of Indiana illustrators; the names
                    of Indiana designers of bookplates; a list of Indiana art schools, art associations, and art clubs;
                    the names of the painters of the portraits of the governors of Indiana; a list of Indiana monuments
                    and markers, including where possible the name of the sculptor; and a bibliography of Indiana
                    artists. This part of the book is a veritable dictionary of Indiana art and will be a joy to all
                    Indiana librarians. A durable cloth binding and quite a complete index make the book especially
                    valuable for reference purposes.
            The work contains eighty-one full page well chosen illustrations, a number of which are familiar to
                    those who visit the art collections in the state. Others are reproductions of pictures in private
                    homes and collections outside of Indiana.
            It is a satisfaction to be able to recommend such a useful and complete piece of work to those
                    interested in this subject. It would be of use in all art libraries in the country, in the larger
                    reference libraries, and of course in every public library in Indiana.
