            <p>Indiana, like other states of the Old Northwest, made an important contribution to the free-state population
          of territorial <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
               </placeName>. Among the emigrants from that state were men destined to become leaders in the struggle with
          pro-slavery forces. Chief of these was James H. Lane, eager for political advancement. The purpose of this
          study is to reveal Lane in transition from Indiana conservatism to <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
               </placeName> radicalism, and to indicate the forces that brought about his rapid evolution.</p>

               </placeName>, the father of James H., was an eminent lawyer of southeastern Indiana, and an ardent supporter
          of Andrew Jackson. He served in the state legislature, became speaker of the house, and represented his
          district in congress during Jackson's second term. James studied law in the office of his father, was
          admitted to the bar, and entered politics as a Democrat.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> In the Mexican War he served as
          colonel of the "Steadfast Third," and made a commendable contribution to Taylor's
          victory at Buena Vista.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Later he returned to Indiana where he raised the fifth Indiana
          regiment which was attached to Scott's command in the campaign for <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>As a member of the National House of Representatives, Lane stood firmly upon the doctrine that the duty of a
          representative was to follow closely the instructions of his constituency.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> In March,
          1854, he became involved in a controversy with certain southern members over this issue. Augustus R. Sellers,
          a <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
               </placeName> Whig, asserted that he would control his constituents by moulding public opinion, rather than be
          controlled by them.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Lane answered this declaration with a sarcastic reference to the
          nature of the people whom Sollers represented: "I do not doubt that the gentleman from <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
               </placeName> has the ability to mould the opinions of that portion of his constituency that requires five men
          to count as three. I am thankful that I represent no such constituency. I am here representing an independent
          constituency whose opinions cannot be moulded by any influences."<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Such a
          statement was naturally resented by southern members of the house. Especially was it offensive to Theodore G.
          Hunt, a <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
               </placeName> Whig, who rebuked Lane for using expressions tending to disparage members representing
          slaveholding states. This personal thrust brought the impulsive Hoosier to his feet, who amid cries of
          "order!" replied: "I will say to the gentleman from <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
               </placeName> that if he intends to apply the term rebuked to me for any sentiment I have uttered, I laugh it
          to scorn! Yes, Mr. Chairman, to scorn! I have uttered no expression intended to disparage members upon this

          said: "The gentleman <hi rend="i">may mould the sentiments of his curly-heads; but thank God I
            represent a constituency that does not require five men to count as three.</hi>"<hi rend="sup">11</hi> He then called upon Lane to state whether the language of scorn and defiance in reply to the rebuke
          were directed at him.</p>
            <p>The house agaín readily gave its consent to a personal explanation, for the clash was more than an
          individual affair. Partisan and sectional feeling were embodied in this war of words between an Indiana
          Democrat and a <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
               </placeName> Whig.</p>
            <p>Lane replied: "<hi rend="i">I did intend the language used by me on Friday last, to apply in
            response to the remark made by him on that occasion. He is to be the judge as to the
            application.</hi>"<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This sharp retort was preceded by a general statement in which Lane explained his attitude toward slavery.
          "I am no advocate of slavery," he said, "I am no slavery propogandist; and yet my
          history will prove that I have gone as far…to maintain the constitutional rights of gentlemen
          representing slave States upon this floor … as any man. I hail from a State that occupies the
          summit of the conservative position … I shall go as far as any of you in trampling out agitation in
          the North, and as far as any of you in trampling out agitation in the South, which is calculated to disturb
          the harmony of the Union."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> This statement demonstrates clearly that he was then
          in sympathy with the compromise policy of Douglas for the maintenance of friendship between the two sections.</p>
            <p>The outstanding measure before the session of 1853-54 was the <placeName>

          constituents he voted for it,<hi rend="sup">14</hi> although he recorded his opposition to the introduction of
          salvery into the new territories.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lane did not stand for reelection, declaring that feeble health prevented him from being a candidate.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> It is entirely probable that he had determined to emigrate to <placeName>

          man of the people. He sought to discover the trend of popular thought, and then used every resource he
          possessed to accomplish the results desired by the people. The same determination and courage which he
          displayed at Buena Vista also served him in contests with "border ruffians" from <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
               </placeName>. The daring but spontaneous assertions made upon the floor of the house in reply to the <placeName>

               </placeName> Whig, the readiness to defend his personal honor at the point of the sword, all reflect an
          impulsive spirit which became even more manifest in the "grim chieftain" of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
               </placeName> history.</p>
            <p>Yet when these analogies are pointed out the fact remains that there is little in his Indiana career which
          foreshadows his strenuous and spectacular course after 1855. The striking characteristics displayed in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
               </placeName> had for the most part lain dormant in the conservative Indiana politician. The need for an
          aggressive leader who could bring organization to a territory in chaos and disorder, brought out that
          imperious and dominant will that defied all opposition and pursued "objects with an energy and force
          that wrung success from adverse circumstances and reluctant fortune."<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A year's residence in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
               </placeName> territory wrought so many changes in the man that it may appropriately be called the transitional
          period in his career. During that time he became a recognized leader of the free-state movement, abandoned the
          party he had supported for twenty years, repudiated his former political associates, and acquired a radicalism
          which stamped itself plainly and indelibly upon the history of his adopted community.</p>
            <p>In emigrating to the frontier Lane had two objects in mind. First, it is entirely probable that he saw in
          territorial <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
               </placeName> a road which would lead to a seat in the <placeName>
                  <country reg="-us">United States</country>
               </placeName> senate. Second, as a means to that end, he desired to organize the Democratic party there,
          perhaps as the agent of Stephen A. Douglas.</p>
            <p>Contrary to his anti-slavery declaration as a congressman from Indiana, the rumor now became current that he
          had made a speech at <placeName>

            <p>Shortly after his appearance in the territory, Lane sought to organize the Democratic party with a view to
          receiving political preferment at its hands. On June 27, 1855, the "National Democracy"
          assembled in the office of Dr. John P. Wood at Lawrence.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Lane was called to the chair
          and explained the object of the meeting. It was resolved that in the opinion of those present, "the
          best interests of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
               </placeName> require an early organization of the Democratic party," and the originators of the
          movement pledged themselves "to use all honorable exertions to secure such a result."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two months later a Democratic mass meeting was announced to assemble at Tecumseh for the same purpose. The
          notice was signed by seventy Democrats, but Lane's name was not among them.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
          This convention assembled on August 30, but it succeeded no better than that of the preceding June. The
          movement touched "no responsive chord" among the setters of the territory, and was likewise
          opposed by the pro-slavery Democracy of <placeName>

          for he consented to join them upon condition that his participation should not be divulged. It was decided at
          this conference that the situation demanded a general convention "in which every locality should be
          fairly represented, and free from domination from local influences." No longer could a dangerous and
          radical policy such as that enunciated by the Lawrence abolitionists be im posed upon the masses without

            <p>Perhaps a fourth of the score of men present believed that a trap was being laid designed "to lead
          the unwary masses into the Democratic fold." The call for a general assemblage to meet at Big Springs
          was therefore duplicated by a Lawrence convention of August 14. This last mentioned meeting, the seventh

            <p>It is evident that Lane was already beginning to shift his position. Although he constantly watched the
          political horizon for signs of ultimate change, this speech demonstrates that his evolution could have been

              free-state men, announced that he would speak the evening of the adjournment of the Lawrence convention

                     </placeName> \V. Reynolds, thus described the meeting thirty years later: <p>"The crowd was
                immense. They came from their cabins on the prairies … from the valleys and the hills. They
                wanted to know from his own mouth the ‘Grim Chieftain's’ position on
                political questions …. Lane was in his best mood. He was prepared for a vituperative,
                sarcastic, ironical and intensely personal speech. Such the crowd usually likes, or used to in the early
                days, when men were walking arsenals and crept over volcanoes. Such an analysis of character was never
                before or since heard in <placeName>

                burlesqued, ridiculed and pilloried in a hysteria of laughter by an excited, cyclonic crowd. No one ever
                afterward doubted where Lane stood. He crossed with a leap the Rubicon of radical politics and burned
                all his bridges behind him. He was not baptized, —he was immersed in the foaming floods of
                radicalism. As the whitecaps rose higher on the stormy and tumultuous political sea, Lane contended the
                stronger and baffled them." Milton W. Reynolds, in the <hi rend="i">

                     <p>While there is truth in this description, the writer has evidently woven into his story much that
                occurred later. Lane had not yet acquired the sobriquet of "Grim Chieftain." Further,
                it is hard to believe, in view of the fact that he was posing as the agent of the National
                Administration, that he denounced his "late Democratic associates" in such unguarded
                terms. Finally, though Lane was shifting his position, he had not yet acquired that radicalism which was
                to make his political career distinctive. Reynolds told the story as it had taken shape in his mind
                through the years, but his memory was very faulty.</p>

          resolutions" is explained by Elliott, a secretary of the convention and an active participant in all
          its proceedings.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> The branch of which Lane was chairman was "charged with
          furnishing the necessary material for a broad and substantial platform;" and was by far the more
          conservative of the two. The second, technically called the committee on resolutions, with Emery as chairman,
          was designed "to furnish explosives and projectiles … too dangerous to be inserted in the
          platform and too radical to be imposed upon the masses." The purpose of such an arrangement was to
          accommodate Governor Andrew H. Reeder, who could thereby assert his indignation at removal by the President at
          the instance of the territorial legislature.</p>
            <p>The free-state platform reported by Lane is an important document in the annals of <placeName>

          organization for the recovery of their dearest rights guaranteed by the constitution and organic act. The
          coöperation of all, whether Whigs or Democrats, native or naturalized, was to be promoted, although
          without any sacrifice of their respective political creeds. The energies of the party thus created were to be
          devoted to the exclusion of the institution of slavery and to the securing of a free constitution for <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
               </placeName>. A reasonable and fair provision was to be made for all slaves within the territory, but upon the
          organization of a state, all negroes, bond or free, were to be excluded by stringent laws. Finally,
          "the stale and ridiculous charge of abolitionism, so industriously imputed to the Free-state
          party," was denied in forceful language.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>

            <p>While Lane's persuasive oratory was necessary to secure the adoption of the platform, the report of

              their judgment and bending them against their will.</p>

            <p>It was in this debate upon the report of the state organization committee that Lane revealed his affiliation

          strongly that he knew the mind of the Administration and again counseled moderation.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> He
          believed it impolitic to resist the territorial legislature. Governor Wilson Shannon had asserted that he

              staggering under their recent defeat and groping for some active policy for relief. He attested that it

              discarded by most, who were suspicious of its origin, as a scheme to entrap and democratize the free-state
              party. It was finally redeemed from disrepute by John Speer, who became sponsor for it before the 14th of
              August convention, with Lane in anxious readiness to support it and press it with all his force to

          animosity, and competed in paying suitable tribute, each to the other. "To the experience, skill and
          perseverance of the gallant Gen. Lane all credit is due," said Robinson, "for the thorough
          discipline of our forces, and the complete and extensive preparations for defense. His services cannot be
          overrated; and long may he live to wear the laurels so bravely won." Not to be outdone by his ranking
          officer, Lane said in the course of his speech: "From Major-General Robinson I received that council
          and advice which characterizes him as a clear-headed, cool and trustworthy commander. He is entitled to your

            <head>The Reservoir Regulators of the Canal Period</head>
            <byline>By Joseph E. Holliday</byline>
            <p>The "Reservoir War" in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Clay County</region>
               </placeName> is one of the interesting phases of Indiana history in the period of canal-building in the State.
          Aside from its local interest, it is an example of the spirit of the frontier which lingered in Indiana until
          the time of the Civil War. Individualism was one of the strongest traits of frontiersmen, and it was
          manifested in many ways. The so-called "Reservoir War" was one of them. It represented a
          tendency of persons to take the law into their own hands if the regular channels of justice, in their opinion,
          failed to do so. Occasional outbursts of this frontier spirit are still seen, one the most recent of which was
          the dynamiting, in the Far West, of the aqueduct which supplied the city of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>
               </placeName> with water, by a group of persons who believed that such a work would destroy the irrigation
          facilities of the <geogName>Owen river</geogName> valley.</p>
            <p>Much has been written on the <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wabash</region>
               </placeName> and Erie Canal, and it is not the purpose of this sketch to repeat the history of that public
          work in detail, but rather to emphasize the history of the "Cross-Cut", or that portion of
          the canal extending from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
               </placeName> to Point Commerce, now known as Worthington.</p>
            <p>In March, 1827, Congress granted to the State of Indiana a quantity of land for the purpose of aiding the
          State in opening a canal, "to unite at navigable points the waters of the <geogName>Wabash
          River</geogName>, with those of Lake Erie". In March, 1832, work was begun on that part of the canal
          which followed the Maumee River to Ft. Wayne and joined the <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wabash</region>
               </placeName> near LaGro. During the next ten years the canal was pushed farther down the <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wabash</region>
               </placeName>, through <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
               </placeName>. The "Mammoth Bill" of 1836 provided that this canal should extend through <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
               </placeName> and across country to connect with the Central Canal. This internal improvement measure launched
          a large undertaking indeed for such a young State. In the end, the total debt accumulated amounted to about
          $13,000,000.00. It was not until 1842 that the Legislature authorized actual building down to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>

          problem to the engineers, and was by far the most difficult piece of engineering along the entire line of the <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wabash</region>
               </placeName> and Erie Canal. Here the canal must cross the "summit" divide, where the water
          supply was scarce. The canal south of the <geogName>Eel River</geogName> divide was to be supplied with water
          entirely from the Splunge Creek Reservoir, which was to cover about four thousand acres of land, with a feeder
          at Rawley's Mill. For the north side of the "summit," the Resident Engineer
          determined to construct a reservoir in the <geogName>Birch Creek valley</geogName> in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Clay County</region>
               </placeName>, from which by a feeder two and one-half miles in length, the water could be carried to the
          summit level. The Chief Engineer reported: "I cannot too strongly recommend the immediate
          construction of this work, as without it, the Division south of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
               </placeName> must be comparatively valueless during the dry season. The cost of the reservoir and feeder is
          estimated at $24,358.00 exclusive of damages for the land occupied, and making provision for
          clearing off 250 acres of the timber".<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The citizens of the County, especially those living in the vicinity of the proposed reservoir, were opposed
          to its construction. When the surveys were being made, the people threatened its destruction if it were built.
          This opposition came because of fears that it would jeopardize the health of the community, since stagnant
          water would breed malaria. All of the timber was not to be cleared off the area covered by water. The Chief
          Engineer had recommended that only two hundred fifty acres be cleared, while the area to be covered by water
          was almost one thousand acres.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the most prominent opponents of the proposed reservoir was Jonathan T. Grimes of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Saline City</settlement>
               </placeName>. A meeting was held at his home, and a resolution passed that, "in view of the known
          danger of these works (reservoirs), we have heard with much regret … that the Trustees contemplate
          the construction of a further Reservoir in the Valley of Birch Creek, in the immediate vicinity of our houses,
          covering a dense forest of many hundred acres, the timber of which is contemplated to be left standing to die

          Green and Mr. John P. Usher of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>

            </p>
            <p>The action of the Governor in authorizing Hanna and Usher to uphold the people was instrumental in arousing
          and sustaining opposition to the reservoir. Of course it was good political strategy to take such steps as the
          people of the county desired, but he failed to hold to this attitude and changed his policy after the
          election.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the attempt of Hanna and Usher to prevent the construction was fruitless. Work was started on the
          reservoir, though in the face of threats by the citizens of the County. It was finished early in 1852. No
          further action was taken by the State government until March, 1853, when an act was passed by the legislature
          authorizing the appointment of a commission of physicians to examine the reservoirs of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Clay</region>
               </placeName> and Gibson counties and make a report to the Governor.</p>
            <p>This report did not recognize the prevailing idea that such bodies of water were detrimental to the public
          health. That on the Splunge Creek Reservoir stated that, "the water is pure and clear, with the
          exception of that which surrounds the timber" and even it "can in no wise contribute to the
          production of malaria … It is the opinion of this Committee, that any body of fresh water receiving
          and discharging the same amount that this Reservoir does … could not alone, under the most adverse
          circumstances become a source of disease". Likewise, the Birch Creek Reservoir was pronounced
          harmless, and it was pointed out that since this area was swamp, "an infinitely worse state of things
          would follow, if the timber be cut away and the direct rays of the sun let in upon its surface."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>The citizens of the county refused to believe such "tales" as those furnished by the
          commission. Were not many people suffering from chills, ague and fever? And what could cause it but the
          Reservoirs? A correspondent writing over the name of <hi rend="i">Truth</hi> claimed, "that we have
          some little confidence left in the office of governor; at least enough to cause us to hope that if he ever
          takes the trouble to read the report, he will see what a farce has been enacted".<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The health conditidns in the vicinity of the reservoirs was pictured very black by the local papers.
          "The land covered by water," ran an editorial, "is not the only lpss to the county,
          but thousands of acres adjacent thereto remain uncultivated, and men are forced to abandon their farms in
          order to save their lives". According to one oitter but facetious correspondent, the fish in the
          Reservoir had no scales, having been "shaken off by the chills".<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>Reports of disease in the vicinity of the reservoirs are clearly exaggerated. The papers do not show a larger
          number of deaths at this time than at any other period, and it is probable that the fear of cholera and
          malaria was a more potent force in arousing antagonism than the actual presence of the disease. Cholera was
          the terror that walked by day, and the fear that stalked by night, for it appeared in many parts of the
          country in this period. Moreover, the Irish workmen who had been employed in building the reservoirs, seemed
          especially susceptible to the disease. The Old Hill Cemetery in the southern part of the county, where many
          Irish laborers lie buried, bears evidence of this fact. In the spring of 1852, cholera broke out among the
          laborers on the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
               </placeName> division of the canal. Over one hundred deaths occurred during the summer, and work on the line
          was completely demoralized. The inhabitants had reason to fear the disease for a person contracting it would
          usually die within a short period of time. The people living in the vicinity of the reservoirs had what seemed
          to them excellent grounds for opposing the construction of a work which they believed to be so detrimental to
            health.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

          adopted a resolution that only legal means should be used in opposition to construction.</p>
            <p>Legal means, however, did not prove satisfactory to some persons and at mignight of June 22, 1854, the
          embankment of the reservoir was cut away, and all the water drained out This marks the beginning of many mob

               </placeName> papers. The <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> complained that, "everything that was reasonable

                  <region type="county">Clay County</region>
               </placeName> residents replied that the citizens had duly requested the Trustees to remove the timber, but
          argued their requests had been disregarded and the reservoir constructed "in such a manner that it
          would depopulate the whole surrounding country." The Canal Company was branded as an
          "overgrown, soulless, grinding monopoly".<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

          compromise by which the Trustees agreed to remove all of the timber from the Birch Creek Reservoir, and the
          citizens promised that no further outrages should be committed. The Trustees, true to their agreement, engaged
          men and began work to clear out the reservoir, at the same time repairing the cut in the embankment at a cost
          of over $1,000. All went well for two more months, when on the night of September 9, 1854, the
          Feeder Dam across <geogName>Eel River</geogName> was burned down to the water's edge. Whether the
          fire was of incendiary origin or not has never been determined, but credit for the deed was given to the
          "Reservoir Regulators," as they now began to be called. Because of the outrages, the
          Resident Engineer estimated the loss in revenue to the Canal Company to be as much as $20,000.00,
          besides "the loss of confidence [of shippers] in the stability of the canal".<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

            <p>On May 8, a force of from one hundred fifty to two hundred men, with blackened faces and armed with guns and
          pistols, broke open the embankment of the Birch Creek Reservoir. Again the precious water escaped. It is said
          that the perpetrators waved the American flag over the breach, thus, according to the friends of the Canal,
          "disgracing the flag of our country". The <placeName>

            <p>This was by far the greatest outbreak that had yet occured, and, on May 24, the Governor issued a

          keep inviolate "the sacred promises of the State of Indiana".<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Governor
          Wright then made a personal visit to the scene of the outrage, and it is claimed that he was warned by posters
          not to employ men to attempt to repair the breach, and workmen were warned off when they did appear.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Fast on the heels of the outrage of May 8, came another. Early in June, the aqueduct
          which carried the water of the canal across Birch Creek was partially destroyed and the
          "Regulators" burned all the buildings that were used by workmen on the canal, together with
          their implements. Such acts drove most of the laborers away, and it became impossible to continue any repair
          work on the reservoir.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

            <p>The people living in the neighborhood disclaimed any knowledge of the attacks, but it naturally reflected on

          promised to remove all of the timber as soon as possible. Seventeen arrests were made in the county and

            <p>Among the last outrages of the "Regulators" was an attempt to cut the bank of the Birch

          other attempts were made, but none of them succeeded. In August, 1857, the aqueduct was again torn down. The
          opposition of the local population; the freshets and breaks in the canal; the competition of the
          railroad—all these spelled the doom of the "Cross-Cut" Canal. In the year 1860,
          two men by the names of Miller and Hedges attempted to keep open the "Cross-Cut" from the

            <p>The action of Governor Wright in calling out the militia seems to have been rather hasty. As has been shown,
          he was at first in sympathy with the citizens in opposing the construction of the Birch Creek Reservoir. He
          engaged Hanna and Usher to begin suit in the courts to prevent the erection of such a reservoir, if it could
          be found that it was detrimental to the public health. The citizens firmly believed the reservoir was a source
          of malaria and cholera; the report of the committee of physicians did not bear out this belief, but the
          residents had no faith in the report. When outbreaks occured, the Governor ordered out the militia, without
          first resorting to the civil authorities. Mr. Hanna believed such action was unnecessary, that the civil

            <head>Origin of the Term "Hoosier"</head>
            <byline>By Oscar D. Short</byline>
            <p>There has been a tradition in our family, which I have known since boyhood, that Aaron Short, an older
          brother of my grandfather, gave to the inhabitants of Indiana the name "Hoosiers".<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So far as I know, my grandfather and his brother Aaron were the only members of the family present on the
          occasion in which Aaron used the word which later came to be applied to himself and other companions from the
          hills of Southern Indiana. They were then employed in construction work on the Canal at the falls of the
            <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> near <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Actual work on the Canal was begun in March, 1826. The first steamboat that squeezed through the Canal, the
            <hi rend="i">Uncas</hi>, made the passage on December 21, 1829, though the work was not yet completed. It
          was not in full operation till 1831.</p>
            <p>During the last year of work on the Canal, that is, 1830, the incident occurred which, trifling as it seemed
          at the time, was to put the label "Hoosier" on millions born in or residing within the
          boundaries of Indiana since that date or who may be born in the State through the coming centuries. My
          grandfather died in 1898. I will present the story as he told it as nearly as possible.</p>
            <p>John Short, a resident of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, migrated across the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> into the hills of southern Indiana in the
          year 1815, entered a farm four miles south of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
               </placeName>, known later as the Evans Wright farm. Here he lived and reared a large family of boys, some of
          whom had been born before he left <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. Among these sons were Aaron Short, one of the oldest, if not the oldest, in the family, and
          Jacob Short, who was born in 1812.</p>
            <p>Aaron and Jacob, the latter of whom was then only eighteen years of age, were employed on the Canal in 1830.
          The building of the project required the work of many laborers who were worked in gangs under separate bosses.
          In one of these gangs, there was a big Irishman who had made a reputation <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi> The writer of this sketch is a son of the late George W. Short of <placeName>

                     </placeName>, Indiana, whose father was Jacob Short, a brother of the Aaron Short, who is believed to have
              first used the word "Hoosier".</item>

               <pb n="102" id="VAA4025-025-2-028"/> as a fighter, and whose foreman sent the word along the canal that he had
          a man who could whip any one on the job.</p>
            <p>When the challenge came to the group where my grandfather and his brother Aaron were working, the latter
          accepted it promptly. The fight was arranged, and, although not carried on under the "Marquis of
          Queensbury's" rules, it proved to be a real fight. The battle was witnessed by quite a
          number of men, principally employees on the Canal.</p>
            <p>Aaron was a large man of powerful build, a giant in strength, who weighed about two hundred fifty pounds. The
          combatants proved to be about equally matched. After they had fought for some time, and while they were in a
          clinch, they rolled off an embankment falling on a pile of rocks several feet below. The fall gave Aaron an
          advantage and he came out winner in the fight. Being elated over his victory and being very active, he did one
          of his "stunts" which was to leap into the air and strike his feet together twice before
          touching the ground again. As he did so, he yelled, "Hurrah for the Hoosier." What he tried
          to say, perhaps, was "Hurrah for the Husher," as I understand some such word was in common
          use in those days to designate the champion fighter. The one who could <hi rend="i">hush</hi> up all comers.
          Or it has been suggested that he was thinking of the "Hussars", hired British soldiers.
          Being comparatively uneducated, as was the rule at that time in the back woods of southern Indiana, he
          mispronounced the word, calling it "hooser" in attempting to allude to the
          Irishman's connection with the English.</p>
            <p>In the first of these two hypotheses, he would have been alluding to himself, which would seem the more
          likely to be true. At any rate, whether he coined the word unknowingly, or whether he said what he meant to
          say, it seems that he and his crowd were, from that day forward referred to as "Hoosiers."
          The name spread to all others living on the Indiana side of the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName> and finally to all living within the boundaries of the State.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[The origin of the term <hi rend="i">Hoosier</hi> is one of the dark questions of Indiana history. Jacob P.
          Dunn, who loved to exercise his ingenuity on any historical problem that was characterized by an element of
          mystery, applied his skill to this one. The results of his investigation first appeared <list type="footnotes">

          the Indiana Historical Society in 1907 (<hi rend="i">Publications</hi>, Number 2, Volume iv), along with a
          short sketch of John Finley, by his daughter, Mrs. Sarah A. Wrigley. Finley was known as the "Hoosier
          Poet" before Riley's day. In February, 1907, prior to the printing of his paper, Mr. Dunn
          added a few paragraphs.</p>
            <p>In this interesting and carefully prepared study, various stories concerning the origin of the word <hi rend="i">Hoosier</hi> were critically handled. No satisfactory conclusion was reached by Mr. Dunn before
          1907. In his <hi rend="i">Addendum</hi> of that year (<hi rend="i">ibid.</hi>, iv, Number 2, pp. 28-29), he
          copied the following from <hi rend="i">The English Dialect Dictionary</hi>: "HOOZEB, Cum. 4 (huzer)
          said of anything unusually large." By way of explanation, he added that the "Cum.
          4" referred to <hi rend="i">A Glossary of Words and Phrases pertaining to the Dialect of
          Cumberland</hi> (ed. 1899). On the basis of this definition, Mr. Dunn was finally ready to state that in his
          opinion, this word <hi rend="i">hoozer</hi> is "the original form" or our word <hi rend="i">"hoosier".</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this opinion of Mr. Dunn is correct, it does not prove that Aaron Short did not use the term under the
          circumstances mentioned, nor that he was not the first to apply it in Indiana. It does, however, dispose of
          several older traditions as to the origin of the word, and it requires a new theory as to the reason for its
          use by the big canal laborer, Aaron Short, who had just overcome his antagonist.—<hi rend="i">Editor.</hi>]</p>

          the country, and the county was organized. We will, however, reserve a notice of the settlement in other parts
          than Concord and Newville Townships for future numbers. In our next, we will give some interesting incidents
          connected with these first settlements along the river.</p>
            <p rend="center">Chapter II</p>
            <p>Dear Reader, the settlements, of which we wrote in our last, were in Concord and Newville Townships. These,
          with Stafford, were then embraced in what was called "<placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">DeKalb</settlement>
               </placeName> Township". In the year 1836 several settlers located in Stafford (we shall mention some
          of them presently). Before proceeding to give incidents, perhaps it might be well (as suggested by a friend)
          to give some of the physical features of the three Congressional Townships, then embraced in one civil
          Township. Concord is intersected, very nearly diagonally from the Northeast to the Southwest corners, by the
          little <geogName>St. Joseph river</geogName>. The township is six miles square, embracing, of course,
          thirty-six sections of land. Along the river are rich bottoms from forty to eighty rods wide. Back of these
          are fertile, well timbered uplands-intermixed, occasionally with some poorer oak-timbered tracts, but all good
          wheat land. The river affords good mill privileges, and, at present, there are two grist and two saw mills
          erected thereon. Bear Creek also runs down from the Northwest corner of the township, through the center, into
          the river. On it a saw mill is now erected, near the centre of the township; and another on the
          "twenty-six mile creek," at the northeast corner. Taking all its natural advantages, perhaps
          Concord may be regarded as about the best township in the county.</p>
            <p>Newville is a fractional township, six miles long, and perhaps two and half wide. The <geogName>St. Joseph
            river</geogName> runs diagonally across the northwest corner. The lands are much the same as in Concord, and
          might be divided into the rich river lands. <pb n="106" id="VAA4025-025-2-032"/> The oak-timbered, wheat lands
          about the centre of the township, and the beech and sugar-timbered lands at the south end.</p>
            <p>Stafford is a fractional township also; and has the river above mentioned, running across the southeast
          corner, and "Big run," a considerable creek, across the north end from West to East. On the
          river and creek the lands are quite fertile. Between the two they are variable, but none too poor for wheat,
          when properly cultivated. John Webster was one of the earliest settlers in the bounds of the Township. He
          bought some hundreds of acres of very rich land on the river near the <placeName>

               </placeName> State line, and, in 1836, settled on it. He was a somewhat eccentric man; an ardent devotee of
          wealth; careless on religious subjects; and yet a good citizen and neighbor. He was very useful in supplying
          the early settlers with corn, potatoes, etc., at very reasonable rates for the times; and, of later years, in
          erecting a good saw and grist mill on his premises. He, and all his sons, three in number, have since left
          their valuable early possessions, and have gone to the "spirit land." His brother, Hazzard
          Webster, was also an early settler, respected by those that knew him. He died in a late year in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
               </placeName>. Jacob Gunsenhouser, John Rose and Rufus Coats, Esq., were also early settlers in this Township;
          all good Christian men, and highly respected citizens. Esquire Coats, has also gone from earth—The
          other two yet survive. S. W. Hackley, was also an early settler, and still lives honored by those who know
          him.</p>
            <p>Many difficulties had to be encountered in getting into the country, at that early day. If the emigrant came
          with wagons, he had to cut and make his own road. If by the river, he sometimes met with
          "shipwreck;" an instance of which we will now relate.</p>
            <p>Judge Widney was from Central <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>, and came by canal to the Alleghany Mountains; over the mountains by steam, ascending and
          descending those inclined planes then again by canal to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
               </placeName>; down the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> by steamboat to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
               </placeName>; then by canal to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Dayton</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>; thence by wagons through (not over) that horrible, horrible
          "Black Swamp" to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
               </placeName>. From thence he and his wife passed up the Indiana trail on horseback along the <geogName>St.
            Joseph river</geogName>, while the family, in the care of John P. Widney and wife, embarked in the pirogue
          of Judge Walden and Thomas Gorrell, who were down for some provisions. The craft was "poled" <pb n="107" id="VAA4025-025-2-033"/> safely (though the load was heavy) until they reached a ripple in the
          river, near David <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
               </placeName>'s when the bow of the boat being turned by the rapid current, the water struck the side,
          and capsized the concern. Down went the pirogue, leaving crew and passengers, small and great floundering in
          water waist deep to a common sized man; and the goods floating down the river in sublime confusion. Some of
          the larger children succeeded in paddling ashore, when the then wife of John P. Widney (now sleeping in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName> graveyard) seized his present wife, then a child of five years old, and upheld her in the water
          until the men succeeded in helping all ashore. The goods were then caught at different points down the river.
          A "trunk containing $800 in bank bills, floated down perhaps half a mile, and when the
          runaway was caught, the bills were completely saturated with the water and had to be dried at the fire.</p>
            <p>As another instance of difficulties in getting into the country, though perhaps not exactly in its proper
          place here, we will relate that Mr. Joseph Miller, the first county surveyor for <placeName>
                  <region type="county">DeKalb county</region>
               </placeName> and his father brought a part of their goods by way of Ft. Wayne to Shyrock's (now
          Stoner's) mill. And from thence to the farm, now owned by Mr. Ditmer, one mile below <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName>, they had to cut their way through dense forest. Having left the balance of their goods and their
          families on the Maumee, they struck through the woods, directly east, by means of a pocket compass, to the <placeName>
                  <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
               </placeName>—going round the worst swamps—and then cut a road all the way back (some 12
          miles) for their wagons to pass—having to bridge a tamarack swamp on the way. This road was known
          as "Miller's trace" for years afterwards, and served as a highway for many
          emigrants. It was where the road now runs, westward from the <geogName>St. Joseph river</geogName>, at Judge
          Widney's.</p>
            <p>Many of the settlers had never seen an Indian, before coming here, but they had heard, and read much of their
          savage barbarity. During the years 1835-8, many of these "Red men," still lingered in their
          native forests, generally in large companies or "camps." They were an object of terror to
          many of the settlers, especially to the women and children; as singly or in caravans, they passed from one
          camp to another. To add to the terror, at first, the hootings of a great owl, unknown in the East, but
          abounding in the western woods, were taken for the "whoops" of these savages. Well do I
          remember a night, in the fall of 1837, spent in terror of the Indians. I had been <pb n="108" id="VAA4025-025-2-034"/> in the country six months, but as yet had seen very few of them. My widowed mother
          with six children, younger than myself (and I not yet 17 years of age), bought, and settled on the farm,
          spoken of in my last, as belonging to Dr. Babcock. Here an Indian trail crossed the river, and on the other
          side was a house where liquor was sold. Soon after nightfall, the real "whoops" were heard
          away in the South woods. The sound drew continually nearer, and increased in volume, till our fears pictured a
          whole army of savages coming to murder us. We put out all the lights; fastened the doors, and concealed
          ourselves in different parts of the house. Soon the Indians were trampling around the house, and their torches
          gleaming through the window. We almost held our breath with fear. Soon however they passed by, down to the
          river, and taking our canoe, crossed over, and their whoops died away—drowned in the
          Indian's favorite beverage, "good old rye". But our rest was spoiled for the night,
          as we continually dreaded their return.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, however, we became better acquainted with the "poor Indian"—as a camp of some
          forty men, squaws and "papooses," spent four or five weeks in their tents, within twenty
          rods of the house—visiting us, or we them daily. The men spent their time in hunting, dressing
          their game, gambling, or lying around the fire like dogs. The women chopped the wood, made the fires, and
          waited on their lords and masters, while the children shot birds with their bows and arrows. Joe Richardville,
          son of the celebrated Chief, was in the camp, dressed partly like an Indian, and partly in the European
          costume. His college education failed to make any thing of him but an Indian.</p>
            <p>The nearest mill and market was Ft. Wayne, about twenty-six miles from the center of the river settlement, by
          land, and nearly as far again by the winding river. There was no wagon road, as yet, and the river was the
          great thoroughfare. It was navigated by means of "pirogues", that is, large canoes dug out
          of the huge towering poplars, abounding along the river. They were sometimes three or four feet wide, and
          seventy or eighty feet long, and would carry quite a burden. They were propelled by means of poles and
          paddles. Coming up the river with a load, when the water was high, was very hard work, especially if the river
          was too high to reach the bottom with poles of a convenient length.</p>
            <pb n="109" id="VAA4025-025-2-035"/>
            <p>Mr. Rhodes, of this village, informs me that, on one occasion, his father and Samuel Wasson, of Spencerville,
          had to pull a loaded pirogue, nearly all the way from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
               </placeName>, to where Spencerville now is, by laying hold of the willows and other bushes along the margin of
          the water. The entire voyage, occupied a week. John P. Widney states that he and some others came up with a
          load of provisions, late in November, 1836, when the river was swollen with the fall rains, and the
          "slush ice" was running. Ice froze on the poles whenever they drew them out of the water.
          These icy poles had to be used with bare hands, as gloves or mittens could not be used. In this way it
          required a full week to come up.</p>
            <p>Provisions were very scarce and dear at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
               </placeName>, at that time. Flour rose to $14 per barrel, and was sometimes
          "wormy" at that. Corn was $1.50 per bushel in the ear, and much of it rotten.
          Salt was $2.25 per bushel, and other things in proportion.</p>
            <p>Living thus distant from mill and market, and that market so high, it may be readily imagined that the
          settlers would all sometimes be reduced to straits in the provision line; and that those scarce of cash, must
          necessarily have seen very hard times, in that respect. Such was actually the case. There were but few
          families, I suppose, but that sometimes were pinched with hunger, without the immediate means on hands to
          satisfy it. Several days together, had nearly all of them sometimes, to subsist on potatoes instead of bread;
          and some would even have been glad to get potatoes. It was reported that one family, now in comfortable
          circumstances, had to live several weeks on vegetables, gathered from the woods, and cooked as <hi rend="i">"greens"</hi> with milk and <hi rend="i">beech bark.</hi> Imagine to yourself the cabin
          of the settler visited, in such circumstances, by severe fevers and agues, sometimes prostrating the whole
          family for weeks, and you will not wonder that some were discouraged, and wished themselves back again at
          their comfortable eastern homes.</p>
            <p>Are you a "new comer" into our country? And would you like a picture of the cabin of the
          early days? Well, you shall have a rough sketch of one. Say we have it sixteen feet by eighteen in size, and
          just high enough for the joists, below the first rib, and then "cobbed off" as usual. One
          man cuts the logs in perhaps half a day, or at most a day. Another, with a yoke of cattle and log-chain,
          "snakes" them out, as fast as cut, <pb n="110" id="VAA4025-025-2-036"/> to the spot cleared
          off for the cabin. The next day they cut a large white oak that will "rive" and, sawing it
          into blocks, four feet long these are split into "bolts," and these bolts riven into
          "shakes" or clapboards. Well, the next day the neighbors, come in, from five or six miles
          around, and throw up the logs, and "notch" them down in their natural rough state, and one
          man, perhaps, "scutches" down the inside of the logs as fast as they are put down in their
          place; while yet another cuts a straight grained ash, and splits puncheons, two inches thick, for the floor,
          and dresses off one side with his axe. Before night the house is cobbed off, the clapboards laid on the ribs,
          and the heavy "weight poles" laid on to keep them in place, and "knees"
          placed to keep these poles from rolling down; these knees commencing against the "butting
          pole" at the eave of the cabin, which butting pole is laid on the "eave bearer"
          (projecting some two feet on each side of the building) against large pins driven into these "eave
          bearers." The "raising" being now over, the owner next builds a
          "backwall" of "niggerheads" (as the rounded stones were called) gathered
          perhaps from half a mile around, as they are sparsely scattered over the surface, or out of the bed of the
          creek or river. Or perhaps, not taking the trouble to gather these niggerheads, the pioneer builds the wall of
          "mud" made of clay dug from the inside of the cabin, just in front of where he expects to
          have his hearth. The wall is, say, six feet wide and four feet high; built against the end wall of the cabin,
          equidistant from the corners. Now he seeks a small tree, with a "crook" similar to a sleigh
          runner, and cutting it of the proper length, splits it for the "arms" of his chimney. Those
          are placed, one at each end of his back wall, with one end of each arm in a crevice between the logs of the
          cabin, and the other lodged against the rough joist, the crook being downward, and entering the crevice a
          little below the top of the back wall. Spliting the "sticks" for his chimney, about the size
          of plastering lath, he now commences building alternate layers of sticks and mud on the arms, above described,
          about three feet by six, at first, but gradually drawing in until it is about two feet by four, and then
          running up, perpendicularly, until the top of his chimney peers above the roof, out of the hole there left for
          it. Making his hearth of clay, well beaten down, he next lays his puncheon floor; makes his clapboard door, or
          hangs up a quilt in place of it; puts in his six light sash, with glass or greased paper to <pb n="111" id="VAA4025-025-2-037"/> transmit the light; lays the chamber floor with clapboards, and behold he has a
          house. Now he must furnish it. Well, taking some puncheons left from the floor, he cuts them into square
          pieces; dresses off one side with his axe; bores holes for the legs; hews out rough sticks for those legs;
          drives them in, and his chairs are made. Cutting some straight iron wood poles, of proper length, for rails
          and posts; boring holes with a large auger in those posts; hewing off the ends of the rails with his axe to
          the necessary size, and then driving all together with his axe, he soon has a bedstead. Stripping a young
          bass-wood tree of its bark, and weaving it around and between the rails—Lo, the bedstead is corded!
          Boring holes in the wall, he dresses rough wooden pins, and lays a broad clapboard thereon—and
          behold his cupboard!</p>
            <p>By way of finishing up this dish of hash, let me tell an anecdote: John P. Widney had just erected such a
          cabin as above described, save that it had, as yet, no floor. His chimney had just been finished, and, in
          building it, he had dug a deep hole just between the door and hearth. He and his wife, seated on a sleeper, in
          front of the fire, were enjoying its genial warmth, on a cold December night. The earth was covered with a
          mantle of snow, and the wind whistled without; but what cared they, in their comfortable dwelling? Two land
          hunters, Mr. Lytle and] another, lost and benighted, were pushing through the snow and brush, when the light
          of the six-light [pane] window, on the tall bluff of the Twenty-six Mile Creek, caught their delighted vision,
          they made towards it, and plunged waist deep into the swollen creek, thick with snow and ice. Out again, on
          the other side, their eyes steadfastly fixed on the beacon light, they soon rapped on the logs at the side of
          the door, and were cordially bade "come in." Turning aside the quilt, they entered; and
          stepping toward the cheerful fire, they both plunged, together, into the "awful abyss" from
          which the substance of the chimney had been drawn. And there we will leave them for the present.</p>
            <p rend="center">Chapter III</p>
            <p>In addition to the difficulties and privations endured by the river settlements, as mentioned in our last
          chapter, was that of a scarcity of teams. Having, as yet, raised nothing to feed teams on in the winter, they
          were willing to make many shifts to get along without. I know a highly respected citizen <pb n="112" id="VAA4025-025-2-038"/> of this county, who has filled several offices, and is now considered wealthy, that
          between the first of January, 1837, and the first of May following, chopped off five acres of heavy timber,
          taking it nearly all down; burned the brush, rolled the logs, and burned them off; split the rails, and
          carried them to their place on the fence on his shoulder; and thus had his field cleared off, and well fenced
          by the time mentioned above, without having a team in the clearing, except perhaps one day to draw the
          remnants of the log heaps together. His wife was his sole help. He chopping and she often picking the brush.
          Many nights he worked by moonlight, until quite late. He "yankee'd" the largest
          logs together as he expressed it, having this in view in felling the trees; carried the smaller logs, or
          dragged them by one end, or rolled them with the handspike to the heap, as best he could. When I visited him,
          on the sixth of May, he and his wife were diggin' holes among the roots with hoes, and putting in the
          seed corn. The crop was attended entirely with the hoe; and in this way he raised a good crop of corn and
          potatoes, without having a plow in the field.</p>
            <p>It was said that William Mathews raised a good crop of corn, planted with a handspike, and tended with a hoe.
          His plan of planting was to strike a sharp handspike into the rich soil diagonally, draw it out, drop in the
          seed, and then press down the soil by stepping on it as he passed on to plant the next hill.</p>
            <p>The settler often found the season for planting on hand, before his clearing was all "burned
          off;" and then sometimes the corn or potatoes was planted between the log heaps. Sometimes the timber
          was thrown into "windrows," some three or four rods apart, and the crop planted between the
          rows, the logs being rolled each way to these "rows," and left to be burned when the crop
          came off.</p>
            <p>The first settlers were quite destitute of religious privileges. Benjamin Alton, of the Disciple or
          Campbellite church, preached the first sermon in the county, so far as I am now informed, in the fall of 1836.
          For some time, perhaps nearly a year, he was the only preacher. He had settled in the woods, and had to clear
          his own land, and get his provisions in the mean time, often by taking jobs of chopping; yet he generally
          preached on Sunday. He was a man of considerable talent, and died some years ago, much lamented. It was said
          that he used to preach in the summer, in his rough tow pants, <pb n="113" id="VAA4025-025-2-039"/> without a
          coat, and with a shoe on one foot and a boot on the other. This is not strange, when I remember that shoes and
          boots were so hard to be had, that John P. Widney and I, during the summer I lived with him (1837) could only
          get one good pair of shoes between us, which we wore on alternate Sundays, one going to meeting, and the other
          staying at home; and that John and Hazzard Webster, used to come down to the present site of Newville, even to
          elections, barefooted.</p>
            <p>The first Methodist two-days meeting was held near Orangeville, in 1837, by N. L. Thomas and Joseph Miller,
          both then residing on the Maumee. Prayer meetings had been held, previously, by religious persons of various
          denominations without any distinctions. The origin of the first one, is thus related by Judge Widney: <quote rend="blockquote">
                  <p>We had been in the country some time, without knowing that there was a praying person in the settlement,
              besides ourselves, when one Sabbath, Mr. R. R. Lounsbery and another man returning from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                     </placeName>, stopped at my house and informed me that Mr. Thomas L. Yates (afterwards Judge) was under
              conviction, and wished me to come and pray with him. I went, and found quite a number of persons in the
              house. I sang and prayed, and while praying, noticed that old father Rhodes was fervently responding to my
              petitions. I then sang again, and called on him to pray, and while he prayed, I noticed that the old lady,
              his wife, was also praying. I next called on her, and found that old mother Yates (Mother to the penitent
              man) was engaged, and so I called on her next, and this closed our meeting. Afterwards we held prayer
              meeting, nearly every Sabbath, at Father Rhodes, my house, Mr. Lounsbery's, Mr.
              Eakright's, etc.</p>

            <p>Rev. Messrs. Coleman and Warner were the first circuit preachers of the Methodist Episcopal church, who
          visited the settlement. I think it was sometime in the year 1838. They organized several classes, at different
          points. Early in the year 1839, sixteen persons, who had been members of the Methodist Protestant church in <placeName>

          was one of the members, and Samuel Widney, Sen'r., was our leader. He wrote to Rev. Joel Dalbey, then

               </placeName>, so far as I know. For sometime, the Disciple, Methodist Episcopal and Methodist Pro't
          churches were the only ones in the country, Jonathan Thomas and Bishop Kumler, were the first United Brethren
          preachers. They labored as missionaries through the country in 1841-1842, if I am correct. S. B. Ward, was the
          first regular Baptist minister in the county, Elders Cherry and Miner, the first Free Will Baptist, and James
          Cather the first Lutheran. Mr. Cather commenced his labors early in the year 1844, and the others several
          years earlier. We will give the dates more definitely when we come to speak of Wilmington Township in which
          Elders Ward and Cherry settled.</p>
            <p>The first person who was married, while a resident of the settlements, we are informed, was Jared Ball, to
          Miss Malinda Slater. The father of the bride resided in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Williams
            County</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, near the present village of
          Ederton, and there they were married; the eccentric bride-groom paying the marriage fee to Mr. Alton, the
          officiating minister, in pumpkins, according to previous contract. As an offset to this story of the pumpkins,
          and to keep it from being lonesome here, I will state that, in later years, a certain Judge performed a
          marriage, the bridegroom in which was the fortunate possessor of a tract of "oak opening,"
          and a "cranberry marsh". After the ceremony, the bland and courteous Judge was informed by
          the happy bridegroom that for his invaluable services, he could have the privilege of getting some cranberries
          in his marsh.</p>
            <p>The first marriage that took place in the settlement, as far as I know, was that of Nelson Ulm to Elvira
          Lockwood. I remember that it was said that the bride was too weakly to stand up during the ceremony. It was in
          the summer of 1837. The first marriage licenses taken out in the county, were those of Francis Smith and Maria
          Gunsenhouser and of John Platter and Ann Emmeline Walden. Both licenses were taken out on the 5th of
          September, 1837; and both marriages were performed by <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
               </placeName> Robinson, the first Justice of the Peace in the county.</p>
            <p>The first funeral, in the settlement, was that of Mrs. Barker, who died just above where Newville now is.
          Judge Widney was sent for to perform the funeral services, there <pb n="115" id="VAA4025-025-2-041"/> being no
          minister then in the settlement. He sang, prayed, and talked to the people a few minutes on the subject of
          death.</p>
            <p>The first store in the county, was opened where Orangeville now is, in the spring of 1837. John Platter, Wm.
          Rogers, a Mr. Savage and some other person, put in each $200, and brought on the amount in such
          goods as the settlers most needed. John P. Widney was employed to cut logs for the store
          house—receiving $2 for the job, and performing it in half a day. The house was sixteen
          by eighteen feet of round logs.</p>
            <p>The first "grist mill" or "corn cracker" rather, in the county, was built
          by Wm. Mathews, on Bear Creek, on the east part of the school section of Concord Township, at the same spot
          where there is now a saw mill, near Mr. Alpheus Draggoo's. It was a small affair truly. The stones
          were about two feet in diameter, and were turned by means of a "flutter wheel" on an upright
          post, set in a tub, through one side of which the water passed. The whole machinery was set in a small rickety
          frame, without weatherboarding. The corn dropped, a grain at a time, from the little hopper; so that perhaps
          in twenty-four hours, at a good stage of water, eight bushels might be "cracked." I remember
          carrying a half a bushel of corn from my brother's, at Newville, to this mill, a distance of four
          miles, on my shoulder, waiting a half a day to get it ground, and then carrying the meal back in the same way.
          Among the humorous tales told of this mill, the following will do to repeat. My brother James, in the fall of
          1837, took a bushel of corn to be ground, and after it had been grinding some time, went below to see how much
          meal was in the little store box, used for a meal chest, and, to his dismay, found a large yellow dog, eating
          the meal as fast as it came from the spout!</p>
            <p>The first election in the county, was held in July, 1837. The settlers on the river, and its vicinity, all
          voted at the house of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
               </placeName> Robinson Esq., at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Vienna</settlement>
               </placeName>, or Newville, as it is now called. Three county commissioners, two associate Judges, and a Clerk
          and Recorder were to be elected—and perhaps some other officers.</p>
            <p>On counting out the votes, a ticket came up that sorely puzzled the Judges, as to whether it should be
          counted or not So much of it, as I can remember ran thus: <pb n="116" id="VAA4025-025-2-042"/>
               <quote rend="blockquote">
                  <p>For commissioners I'll tell you sirs;— The old Major— Or Johnny Blair;
              William Roger And Peter Fair For Clerk, and Recorder too, John F. Coburn, sure will do;— Arial
              Walden for Judge, And James Bowman for a drudge.</p>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Much merriment was held over this ticket. The office of drudge was supposed to be intended to accommodate the
          court with whiskey; as some Judges, at that early day, took their drams. It was not then known who put in this
          ticket; but it has been supposed that it was one who has since filled the office of Judge himself. Who brought
          his liquor, the records say not. The gentleman voted for to fill the last office mentioned on the ticket, was
          not elected, and, if I mistake not, still lives in Newville Township, in better business.</p>
            <p>Samuel Widney, Peter Fair and A. F. Beecher, were elected county Commissioners; Arial Walden and Thomas L.
          Yates, Judges of the court, and John F. Coburn, Clerk and Recorder.</p>
            <p>John P. Widney, carried the returns of this election to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName> (as Wesley Park's cabin, and perhaps one or two others, were then called) and I
          accompanied him. We went on foot, and followed an Indian trail (s there was no road) wading all the swamps on
          the route. On returning, not being a very good Indian, I gave out, so as hardly to be able to drag my weary
          limbs home. This was my first and last experiment in carrying election returns.</p>
            <p>Mr. Yates, one of the Judges elected, was rather an odd genius of a backwoodsman. When he was elected, he
          dryly remarked that they were using up the buckeye timber first, and reserving that of a superior quality.
          This, however, was only his opinion, and, as he had not yet taken his seat on the bench, it did not amount to
          law.</p>
            <p>It is said that when called to his seat beside the president Judge, Hon. Charles Ewing, he was dressed in his
          coarse hunting shirt, and fox skin cap, and seemed much embarrassed in his new position. No doubt he would
          have felt more at home with his rifle on his shoulder, after a good fat "buck". He made a
          good Judge however, as did his associate, Judge Walden.</p>
            <pb n="117" id="VAA4025-025-2-043"/>
            <p>We would feel that we were derelict to duty, not to mention a few more of the early settlers along the river.
          As for instance, Solomon DeLong and Daniel Strong, of Newville, who have each filled the office of County
          Commissioner; H. Fusselman, one of the first Justices of Stafford; Christian and Samuel Wannemaker, who have
          also filled offices in the same township; Lott Herrick, of Concord, the first probate Judge of the county;
          Joseph E. Sawtell, the bland and polite salesman, who was, no doubt, the second man to sell goods along the
          river, and in the county; Rev. N. L. Thomas, the first one to open a store in Newville; Geo. Barney Esq., one
          of the first Justices for Concord [Township] and who still fills that office; James Hadsell, one of the
          earliest and most useful pioneers of Concord, who has filled several responsible offices; Cornelius Woodcox,
          one of the first supervisors for <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">DeKalb</settlement>
               </placeName> township, when it embraced three congressional townships, and but two road districts; and
          especially Hon. R. J. Dawson, who has since filled so prominent a place in public affairs. But space would
          fail us to speak of all, so we must close the list, though many respected pioneers are still unmentioned.</p>
            <p>I remember clear away back beyond "the flood." Shall I tell you something about that
          memorable event? Well I will. Many of the first settlers along the river built their cabins on the bottoms, on
          account of the rich deep soil, so inviting for corn and potatoes. Now it happened that St. Jo.,
          notwithstanding his saintship, had a naughty trick of "getting high" occasionally, and, on
          such occasions, took a regular "spree," transcending all the bounds of propriety, and
          scattering and destroying things in general. It was in the winter of 1838, about the first of January, when we
          were dwelling securely in the neighborhood of this mild looking saint, that he unexpectedly
          "imbibed" too largely, got high, and advanced upon us, raging and foaming terribly, without
          any provocation whatever. But, lest we should be guilty of what Dr. Clark calls making a figure go
          "all fours," we will drop it and say that the river rose until it overflowed it's
          banks, and surrounded the house. This alarmed us some, but it seemed to be nearly at a stand, and we hoped it
          would soon retreat. But instead of falling, it continued to rise, until the loose floor began to float. We
          then raised the floor about six inches, being sure that the water would rise no more. We were doomed however
          to be again disappointed. The water still rose. Being <pb n="118" id="VAA4025-025-2-044"/> mid-winter we had
          all our fire wood to "boat" in, with the canoe, which we kept cabled at the cabin, and we
          managed still to keep a fire above the water. The night after raising the floor, we retired to rest, and the
          next morning found the floor all afloat again. So we concluded to embark for safer quarters. Running the canoe
          into the door, we took the passengers from the bed, and packing every thing that the water could injure above
          its reach, we crossed the raging river, to sojourn with friends till "after the flood." The
          water rose until it was two and a half feet deep in the cabin, and then began to subside. Just then a severe
          freeze set in, leaving the entire bottoms covered with a sheet of thick ice. When the river got within its
          banks again, we returned, threw out the ice, and again took up our residence in the cabin. Other settlers,
          besides us suffered from this saintly freak, but we have not the particulars.</p>
            <p rend="center">Chapter IV</p>
            <p>We have learned, since writing our last chapter, that Colin Robinson and his brother Henry came to their half
          brother's (Mr. Gavin <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
               </placeName>'s), on the Maumee, near Brunersburg, in the year 1833, and that soon after their
          arrival, they went up the Maumee, to where William Rogers then lived, a little below where the village of
          Antwerp now stands; and from thence struck across the woods, by means of a pocket compass, some fifteen or
          twenty miles, through the unbroken forest, to the <geogName>St. Joseph river</geogName>. When in the midst of
          the wilderness, they lost the needle from their compass, and had to hunt a considerable time among the leaves
          before they found it. Following the direction pointed out by the slender finger of their magnetic guide, about
          dark they struck the bluff of the St. Jo., about where Henry Robinson now lives, and from thence made their
          way, amid the gathering shades of evening, down the river, more than a mile, to within a few rods of where the
          cabin afterwards stood, spoken of in the Indian story, and in that of "the flood" in our
          last chapter.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lytle then lived in a cabin over the river, and about forty rods back from it, and their object was to
          get over for supper and lodgings, as they had eaten nothing since early breakfast. It was the 24th of
          December, and, when they reached the river, they found it frozen in, about one fourth of the breadth of the
          river, and no way of crossing; so they <pb n="119" id="VAA4025-025-2-045"/> were under the necessity of
          camping for the night. A huge walnut, perhaps six feet in diameter, had been cut down probably by the Indians,
          and still lay with one end on the stump, at the time of the flood, four years after the time of which we are
          now speaking. Under this walnut, they took lodging for the night, having first struck up a fire. The night was
          passed very uncomfortably, in acute suffering from cold and hunger. The next morning, (Christmas 1833) they
          cut down the dry stump of a tree (for they had their axes with them) which broke in its fall. Tying the two
          parts together, side by side, with bass wood bark, they launched it, breaking the ice at the margin and on it
          crossed the river with their imaginations filled with visions of a plentiful warm breakfast. On arriving at
          Mr. Lytle's, they found no one at home but the children, and nothing to eat but a rabbit; and, while
          they were cooking this, a cat ran away with half of it. The Messrs. Robinson had intended to enter land and
          make "a beginning" on it, but they found provisions so scarce that they returned the next
          day; and, in the following spring, Mr. Colin Robinson entered the excellent tract of land on which he now
          resides, just across the river from Orangeville, in Concord Township. He did not settle on it however, for
          three years afterwards.</p>
            <p>It was perhaps in the summer of 1834 or 1835, that John Platter and Solomon DeLong crossed the same
          wilderness, and, getting bewildered in the midst of it, almost famished, for want of water and had to camp for
          the night. With their axes and hands, they dug a hole in a prickly-ash swamp, and found water, but it tasted
          so much like the decoction of gunpowder, that they could scarcely drink it, though suffering with thirst. The
          early settlers will bear me witness that mosquitoes in the summer, were no scarce article in that day of
          general scarcity. In fact, they were as plentiful as we can imagine flies to have been in the fourth Egyptian
          plague. You could not stop two minutes, in the woods, without having them by myriads singing their unpleasant
          song with treble voices about your ears, or poking into you their tormenting bills, almost as much to be
          dreaded as the doctor bills of the early day. Well, to protect themselves against these impudent serenaders,
          and to get rid of the presentations of their numberless bills put in the form of pressing duns, not for money,
          but for blood, these unwilling lodgers in the wilderness <pb n="120" id="VAA4025-025-2-046"/> cut bushes, then
          full of green leaves, and covered themselves deeply in these, until the mosquitoes were utterly at a loss to
          know how to get at them; and thus they passed the night.</p>
            <p>In the winter of 1836-37, in the month of January, the above named Mr. Colin Robinson, having lately married
          a wife, set out on a bridal (or bridle as you please) tour from the Maumee, to the cabin built on his land on
          the St. Jo., she on horseback, and he on foot. Coming to the Mer-del-arm, a considerable creek between the
          rivers, running through broad Cottonwood swamps, he found it swollen by recent rains and melted snow, until it
          spread over the swamps, about a mile on each side. Through this wide-spread water, he waded along the narrow
          trace, sometimes waist deep, and she followed on her horse. Coming to the main channel of the creek, he found
          it covered with thick ice, raised up several feet by the swollen waters, and that the ice was nearly on a
          level with the horse's breast as he waded up to it. Here Mr. Robinson got his wife off the horse on a
          stump; and prevailed on the horse to jump down on the other side of the channel. He then, by means of a pole
          placed from the stump to the ice, got Mrs. Robinson on the ice, and from the ice on the other side, on her
          saddle again, wading out as he had waded in.</p>
            <p>The next summer, Mr. Robinson and his brother went down the <placeName>
                  <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
               </placeName> to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
               </placeName>, and then down the Maumee, to near where Defiance now is, for seed wheat and corn to be ground.
          They performed the voyage in a considerable sized pirogue. Loading it with sixty bushels of grain, they
          started back. They had some difficulty in getting along, being both raw hands at
          "Piroguing", but succeeded tolerably well until they reached "Bull Rapids"
          near the State line, about eighteen miles below <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
               </placeName>. The wind ruffling the surface, they could not see bottom, ran on the rocks, and stuck fast.
          Getting out into the water, they shoved the pirogue over the rocks, and up the rapids;" wading
          sometimes in water to the waist. Getting aboard, they got along tolerably well, till they reached
          "Cole's Dam," about where Wines' mill now is, one mile below <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
               </placeName>. Here they had to unload, and carry the grain on their shoulders, up a steep bank about thirty
          feet high, go more than a half mile after a rope, and, tying this to the bow of the boat, pull it over the
          dam, coming very near sinking it in the operation. They then re-loaded, and <pb n="121" id="VAA4025-025-2-047"/> were overtaken by darkness at the mouth of the St. Jo. From this to John's mill they had much
          difficulty in getting along in the darkness and shallow water. Getting to the mill, they unloaded that part of
          the grain intended to be ground, and took their lodging for the night on the bare ground with no covering but
          the blue sky. In fact, during the entire route, they had the same bed and covering every night. From
          John's mill, the rest of the way home, they had to get out at nearly every ripple, and push the boat
          up; and sometimes it was necessary to unload and re-load, laying the bags on the large rocks in the ripples,
          until they got the boat over. Soon after his return, Mr. C. Robinson was prostrated with a severe attack of
          the pleurisy, brought on by exposure.</p>
            <p>We spoke, just now, of "Doctor bills" as compared with "mosquito bills."
          That you may have some idea of the force of the comparison, we will give one instance of the sickness of the
          early settlement.</p>
            <p>Mr. Isaac Meeks, now of Union mills, LaGrange county, is my informant. Says he: <quote rend="blockquote">
                  <p>I came into the Coburn settlement, Concord Township, soon after Mr. Asher Coburn (who was the first
              settler) and built a cabin fourteen feet square, and moved therein. Sometime after this Mr. Ebenezer
              Coburn and John H. Coburn, the one my father-in-law, moved into the settlement, and I offered them both
              the hospitalities of my cabin. We were now fourteen in number, in a cabin fourteen feet square, and one
              story high. In a little while, every one of us took down sick, and we had to swing up beds to the sides of
              the cabin, one above the other, to accommodate all the sick. I was sick four or five weeks, and the rest
              mostly as many months!</p>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>We spoke in our last chapter, of the difficulties and hardships of the settlers in getting to mill and
          market. We will now give another instance, exceeding in painful interest any yet mentioned. The sufferer was a
          resident of Hicksville, just over the State line, in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>; but the scene of his suffering was in this [<placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">DeKalb</settlement>
               </placeName>] county; hence we will relate the circumstances, so far as memory may not prove treacherous.</p>
            <p>It was in the winter of 1837-38 that Mr. Osburn started from where Hicksville had just been laid out, with an
          ox team, to go to mill at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
               </placeName>. Returning on the east side of the St. Jo. river, he was overtaken by night above where Leo now
          is. Having had to wade into the creeks, and break ice before his oxen, his clothes were wet, and it was
          freezing severely. <pb n="122" id="VAA4025-025-2-048"/> Onward, however, he made his way, through the snow and
          darkness, on a stormy winter night, until he began to feel that he was freezing. Leaving his slow team in the
          road, he then started, hoping to reach Mr. Brant's (across the river from where Spencerville now is)
          but soon found his legs becoming so stiff that he could no longer walk. Knowing that his life was at stake, he
          then crawled on his hands and knees about a mile, until he found that his strength was too far gone to proceed
          in this way. He now commenced crying for help and Mr. Brant's dog, hearing his voice, commenced
          barking, and some of the family going out to see what was the matter, were led by the dog to the poor
          sufferer, about a mile off, and he was borne into the house. Both his legs, however, had to be amputated just
          below the knees. He remained several days at Mr. Brant's and was drawn home on his sled.</p>
            <p>As mills were so scarce and distant, the pioneers had to tax their inventive powers to provide a substitute.
          So, in process of time, nearly every settler had a family hand-mill, made according to the following receipt,
          viz: Take a sound log of some hard wood, such as beech or sugar, about twenty inches in diameter. Saw it off,
          about three feet in length. Set on end and with an inch-auger, commence boring down, diagonally, into the
          upper end, from near the circumference to the center of the log, and continue until you have surrounded the
          end of the log with auger holes meeting in the center. Take a chisel and cut down between the holes until you
          get the block loose, that has thus been bored under, and it comes out in the form of an inverted cone. Trim
          out the funnel-shaped hole thus left with the chisel as well as you can, and then to make entirely smooth and
          to harden it, build a fire of coals therein. When sufficiently burned for the purpose mentioned, take out the
          fire and scrape the coals off as cleanly as possible, and you have a large mortar. Now take a stick about as
          thick as your wrist, and two and a half feet long, and splitting one end, insert an iron wedge with its edge
          in the split. Put on an iron ring and drive it over the iron wedge, so as to hold it fast. Trim off the stick
          small enough to handle conveniently and you have a pestle. Now you may put a little corn in your mortar, and
          beat it with your pestle as fine as you can. Sift out the finest, and you have corn meal. Blow the bran out of
          the balance, and you have "hominy."</p>
            <p>It is much to the credit of the pioneers of our county, that <pb n="123" id="VAA4025-025-2-049"/> amidst all
          the difficulties of the early settlements, they did not neglect the education of their children. I know
          settlements in the south part of this State, that had existed twenty years, without a schoolhouse. Not so in
          this county. No sooner had a few settlers got their cabins raised and fixed so that they could live in them
          than they raised their schoolhouse, rough and uncomfortable it is true, but on an equality with their
          residences. They were of round logs, with clapboard roofs, chamber floor and door also of clapboards. Ground
          floor was of puncheon, the benches of the same, or rather generally of small logs split in two and turned with
          the flat side up, with rough wooden pins driven into auger holes for "legs". The chimney was
          made of sticks and mud built as described in a former chapter, but generally larger than the chimneys of
          private residences, so that twenty or twenty-five children surround it in a semi-circle, while a burning
          "log heap" flamed on the hearth in the winter. They got light from its ample throat in the
          summer.</p>
            <p>The windows generally were made by cutting out a log nearly the whole length of the house, leaving a hole,
          say a foot wide and eighteen or twenty feet long. Into this a long sash was inserted, consisting of several
          single panes, joined together horizontally, until the long hole was filled. In some cases that came under my
          notice, however, this long hole was filled with a kind of lattice work of sticks, and upon this greased paper
          was pasted to transmit the light. Under this long window, large holes were bored into the log, rough wooden
          pins driven into these holes, and an unplaned plank laid on these pins. This was the writing desk. The writers
          sat on a long-legged bench, facing this plank and the window, and if they were many they prevented the light
          of the window, especially on a cloudy day, from reaching many scholars, sitting back from it, but on such
          occasions they drew near to the huge tunnel of the chimney and were <hi rend="i">enlightened.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In just such school houses, I taught several schools in an early day, and experienced the truth of
          Thompson's couplet: <quote rend="blockquote">
                  <p>"Delightful task! to rear the tender thought, And teach the young idea how to

            <p>Will you allow me to enliven this prosy chapter with another ancedote? Well, a <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
               </placeName> dandy better acquainted with books and pavements than with "backwoods" life or
            <pb n="124" id="VAA4025-025-2-050"/> character, concluded to visit the West and see "the
          natives." As he was riding along on a cold day in winter, when sleighing was good, in his fine
          sleigh, wrapped up in his "buffalo," with his greatcoat on, his fur cap tied down over his
          ears, and his fur gloves up to his elbows, he passed one of these frontier school houses. It was
          "recess," and the teacher and some of the "bigger" boys were out at the
          side of the school house knocking some squirrels off a tall hickory tree with a rifle. The dandy reined up his
          horse a few minutes, and as he saw the squirrels drop one after another, perpetrated the following parody on
          the above oft quoted couplet of Thompson: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Before proceeding with the Townships in succession, we will give a brief history of the organization of the
          County, and of the location and settlement of the County Seat—the goodly town of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName>. In this part of our duty, as chronicler, we are happy to be able to give the reader the
          narrative of Mr. Wesley Park, who laid out the town; and who, after filling many offices in the County is
          still among us, in the full prime of life and usefulness, respected by all: <quote rend="blockquote">
                  <p rend="center">WESLEY PARK's NARRATIVE</p>
                  <p>In the fall of 1835, George Stone, Hiram Johnson and myself, left <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Licking county</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                     </placeName>, in a two-horse
              buggy, to seek a home, in what was then called "the West." We went by way of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                     </placeName>, Sandusky, Maumee, Defiance, Fish creek and Lima to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                     </placeName>. We then returned to Lima, where Johnson and Stone settled, and started a tannery. I returned
              to Fish creek, and entered land joining John Holton's. I then returned to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                     </placeName>, and staid till February, 1836. Started to Indiana, then, with a drove of cattle, and a load
              of dried fruits. Got to Lima, sold out and started in company with John B. Howe, Esq., to the center of
              the New county, afterwards called <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">DeKalb</settlement>
                     </placeName>, to locate a site for a County Seat. We got to <geogName>Pigeon river</geogName>, and the
              canoe upsetting, I swam over the stream. Howe came over in the canoe, swimming his horse along side. Staid
              all night at Glover's. Started in the morning on our journey, and that night reached section 13,
              Tp. 34, Range 13 (Union Township) and lay out in the woods. The snow was four inches deep. We kindled a
              fire and I peeled bark to lie down on, but Howe being tired, or lazy, or both, lay down on the snow. In
              the morning, he had melted his whole <pb n="125" id="VAA4025-025-2-051"/> length in the snow, and was wet,
              but I was dry. I lay all night with my rifle at my side, to be prepared for the wolves that howled around
              continually. After hunting a day for the best site, decided on the piece of land where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
                     </placeName> now is. Entered the land, and laid out the town. I then put up a shanty ten by twelve feet,
              and cut a road through to Pleasant Lake, brought through a cart load of goods with a yoke of oxen and a
              milk cow. Afterwards, Joseph Miller and I started from William Miller's (where Mr. Ditmer now
              lives), I with my cart and oxen, and he with me to help cut the road. (The road spoken of in a former
              chapter as being cut through from Blair's mill, afterwards Shryock's, being nothing but
              a trace with the logs still in, was too narrow for a cart, as we shall notice hereafter). My object was to
              get through, by way of Blair's mill, to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                     </placeName> for a load of provisions. It was afternoon before we started, and night overtook us near the
              little creek that crosses the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                     </placeName> road beyond the county poor-house. We had no provisions along, as we expected to get through
              to Blair's. The cow, however, that I brought through from Pleasant Lake, being used to following
              the team, was, fortunately with us, and I milked her and told Miller that milk was good enough for me.
              Miller didn't like to drink the new milk, but there was no alternative, so he took a good
              draught. It did not lie well on his stomach, and he soon threw it up. The next morning, after lying out
              through the night, we cut through to the mill, and I went on to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                     </placeName>. Miller returned to get his breakfast, no doubt with a good appetite. Getting back with my
              provisions, I set up tavern in my shanty. I did my own cooking, and was crowded with travelers and land
              hunters, who came to have me show them land to enter. One night I kept fifteen men, who very nearly filled
              my hotel. Some lay on a shelf, and the rest on the ground under it; so there was plenty of bed room. After
              eating up the first load of provisions, I went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                     </placeName> for another. On my return, Little Cedar creek was so high, that I had to swim my oxen, and
              carry the load and cart by pieces over the creek on a log. I had adopted as my motto "go
              ahead." Got back again to the hotel. Kept travelers, showed land, and erected a cabin 18 by 20
              feet, 1/12 stories high, with a roof of rafters and clapboards. It stood on the lot where Hiram Griswold
              now lives, close to the saw mill. I then returned to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                     </placeName>, and brought out my wife Sophia and my son Amos, then a child. Lancelet Ingman and family,
              also came with me. We all arrived at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
                     </placeName>, on the 6th day of August, 1836. We laid down a few puncheons, and went to housekeeping. A
              few days work completed our cabin.</p>
                  <p>In the winter of 1836, the act passed the Legislature to organize <placeName>
                        <region type="county">DeKalb County</region>
                     </placeName>. Littlefield, of LaGrange; Gilmore, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Steuben</settlement>
                     </placeName>, and Robert Work, of Allen, were appointed Commissioners to locate the County Seat. I was
              appointed by the Governor or sheriff of the new county, with authority to appoint the place for the
              elections, in the few precincts in the county, and to receive and forward the returns. The result of the
              election has already been stated in these "Pioneer Sketches." After the organization of
              the county, my house served as Court house, Jail, Hotel, Church, Cooking-room, Sleeping apartment
              &amp;c. &amp;c. As sheriff appointed and afterwards elected, I had no jail but the upper chamber
              of my cabin. I used to put prisoners up, and then take away the ladder, and tell them <pb n="126" id="VAA4025-025-2-052"/> to stay there; and they always did so. The lower chamber was the courthouse.
              During the sitting of court, it had to suspend until dinner was cooked. This gave the judge time for a
              nap, which was very desirable, as he was generally fatigued and sometimes rather
              "boozy". Charles Ewing, was the president Judge. He was brother to the celebrated fur
              traders, W. G. &amp; G. W. Ewing. Judge Yates, has been spoken of as an odd genius of a backwoodsman.
              One day he got "tight," and sentenced Jo. Bashford, to receive a whipping, and swore
              that as he was the court, and had passed sentence, he would inflict the penalty. As the Judge was making
              toward the criminal, with this avowed intention, I seized him and giving him a whirl, told him plainly
              that if the court persisted in inflicting the penalty threatened, the sheriff would put the court
              "up the ladder." Upon this the court acknowledged the authority of the sheriff, and
              adjourned peaceably.</p>
                  <p>Will you allow me now to go back to the winter of 1837-38, and relate some incidents of that hard winter?
              There were now about thirty families in the county, and many of them suffered severely; having to bring
              all their provisions from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                     </placeName>, or the Northern prairies, with scarcely anything that could be called roads. At one time our
              corn cost $3.00 per bushel t I saw teams that had to travel seventy-five miles for provisions.
              I never drove more than sixty miles for corn, beyond <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                     </placeName> up the <geogName>St. Mary river</geogName>. It was a trying time for me and my wife, but she
              was always cheerful. I took the rheumatism and lay several weeks. In December the snow fell two feet deep.
              Emigrants were still coming in. A man, woman and child left Pleasant Lake, with a wagon and yoke of
              cattle, to go ten miles south of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
                     </placeName>. One of their oxen mired down, near where Isaac B. Smith now lives, in Smithfield Township,
              eight miles north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
                     </placeName>. There was then no house between Steubenville and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
                     </placeName>. The mired ox died, and they turned the other loose, and started for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
                     </placeName> afoot, carrying the child. The waters were then high, and they had to wade the small streams.
              About nine o'clock at night, they reached our cabin, with their clothes frozen above their
              waists. We gave them dry clothes, and a warm supper and kept them till the roads were broken. A few
              minutes after the arrival of these sufferers, a traveler came in, and told us that a man and boy were out
              in the trail about six miles, in a suffering condition; not being able to strike fire, and the man so
              frozen as to be unable to travel. On receiving this information, Wesley White and Wm. Palmer, got up the
              pony and started for the sufferers. They found the man on section nine, township thirty-four, range
              thirteen. (We always counted by sections as the trail was very crooked.) They got him on the pony, and
              brought him in, about midnight, frozen to the knees; yet he contended that he was not cold. We got his
              feet and legs into a tub of spring water, and thus drew out the frost. But the boy must yet be saved. The
              old man offered us <hi rend="i">fifty cents</hi> (!) to bring him in, which led me to administer to him a
              severe reproof. I told him if the boy was not worth more than fifty cents, he was not worth bringing in.
              He was then ten miles out, in snow two feet deep, among swamps filled with water and swollen streams. No
              money, however, was needed to induce us to go to his rescue. He had kept traveling, and was thus saved
              from freezing. They proved to be Mr. <pb n="127" id="VAA4025-025-2-053"/> Graden and son, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Noble county</region>
                     </placeName>. They had left home in pursuit of cattle. The snow commenced falling and they traveled on
              through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fairfield</settlement>
                     </placeName>, and until they struck the trace, and knew not which way to return. They were well provided
              for at our cabin, and in a few weeks, were able to return home.</p>
                  <p>Wesley White, who was so active in the above rescue, was a good man. He had come down from Lima to stake
              out some lots. He afterwards went to Sparta in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Noble county</region>
                     </placeName>. He was deputy clerk for Isaac <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                     </placeName>, and afterwards clerk of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Noble county</region>
                     </placeName>. After thus saving the life of others, he was drowned in <geogName>Elkhart river</geogName>,
              west of Albion. Wm. Palmer was a rather mischievous old bachelor who loved to play pranks on the Indians.
              They used to annoy us considerably, though they furnished us with venison, bear meat, turkeys,
              cranberries, &amp;c. for money, or such things as we had to exchange. They were honest, and some of
              them religious, before the whites gave them "fire water," and stole their ponies and
              blankets. They used frequently to apply to me to take away "bad Indian" when any of
              their number misbehaved. After the whites had created in them the unnatural appetite, they were very fond
              of whiskey. One day a poor squaw came to my house, and begged hard for whiskey. Palmer took the
              pepper-sauce bottle and handed it to her. She took a very hearty drink, but, as soon as she took the
              bottle from her lips, she began to spit, sputter, and hollow "pizen pizen," while Bill
              Palmer rolled and laughed to his heart's content. After her sufferings were over, I and my good
              Sophia took a little laugh at her, and she never troubled us again.</p>
                  <p>The Potawattomis and Miamis were the principal tribes in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">DeKalb</settlement>
                     </placeName>. Their manner of burying the dead was to dig a grave eighteen inches deep put in the dead,
              cover with leaves, and then build a tight pen of poles over the grave. Sometimes they cut down a tree,
              split off a piece from the top of the log, dug out a trough, put in the body, and then covered it up
              closely with poles. They burnt the leaves around these burying places every fall, to keep the fire in the
              woods from getting to them. They disliked very much to have their dead interfered with, yet it was done,
              by unprincipled whites. It was not uncommon to see their graves opened, the bones scattered around and the
              skull of an Indian set out on the log in full sight.</p>
                  <p>The spring of 1837, was very gladly hailed by the settlers after stemming the storms and suffering the
              privations of a hard winter. During this season, settlers began to come in more plentifully, and several
              cabins went up in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
                     </placeName>. I had given one third of the lots to the county; receiving no compensation but the assurance
              that it would be permanently the county seat. In most cases too, I gave a lot to every settler building
              thereon. This year (1837) I and Mr. Ogden built the saw mill. The town continued steadily to improve, and
              has been blest with good inhabitants, with but few exceptions. Much of the land in the county was taken up
              by speculators. This hindered its settlement to a considerable degree for some years. The crash of banks
              in 1837-1838 was severely felt and many suffered for want of food and raiment. 1836 and 1837 were healthy
              seasons. 1838 was more sickly, 1839 still more so, and from that <pb n="128" id="VAA4025-025-2-054"/> time
              till 1850, there was more or less of billious compaints every season. Since 1850, both town and country
              have been generally healthy."</p>

            <p>The first board of County Commissioners met in the same month in which they were elected, namely July 1837,
          and appointed the following county officers, viz: Clerk pro-tem., Wesley Park; County agent, Byron Baunel;
          County Assessor, John Blair; County Collector, Ingman; County road Commissioner, Samuel Eakright; County
          Surveyor, Joseph Miller; County Commissioner of the three per cent, fund, R. R. Lounsbery.</p>
            <p>At this session, the board allowed Wesley Park $50.84, for the following list of services, viz:
          For services as sheriff until this session; for services as commissioner, in running out the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
               </placeName> and Cold Water State road, and also the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
               </placeName> and Defiance State road. How would officers, now-a-days, like to do so many, and such laborious
          services, for so little pay?</p>
            <p>The commissioners, to lay out the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
               </placeName> and Cold Water road, were W. Park, G. Gilmore and Murray. Those to lay out the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
               </placeName> and Defiance were Park and Hostetter. The latter resided on the Haw Patch, in Noble Co., and
          never came to view the road. Park went on alone, and got the next legislature to legalize his act. The chain
          carriers on the last mentioned road were Henry Feigler and John Miller. Joseph Miller surveyed both roads.</p>
            <p>At this first session, the board organized <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
               </placeName> township, then embracing <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Troy</settlement>
               </placeName>; and at the September session Union township embracing Jackson, Richland, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fairfield</settlement>
               </placeName> and Smithfield. W. Park was appointed supervisor of the whole five Congressional townships with
          authority to work all the hands. Wonder how he would like to be supervisor of all this district now? At this
          fall session, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
               </placeName> and Wilmington townships were also organized; leaving <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">DeKalb</settlement>
               </placeName> Township still to embrace Concord, Newville and Stafford. The name was changed [from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">DeKalb</settlement>
               </placeName>] to Concord, in March, 1838.</p>

            <p>On the 6th of March, 1839, the county board appointed T. J. Freeman, Wesley Park, and Nelson Payne,
          commissioners to build a jail; and in April, 1840, they appointed the same persons commissioners to build a
          court house. When we come to write particularly of Union Township, we will give some more items in reference
          to the growth of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName>, the first business men &amp;c. For the present we will resume the plan proposed at the
          outset of taking each township separately.</p>
            <p>Jackson Township, lying in the same tier of Townships, east and west, with Newville, and Concord, and joining
          the latter, will first claim our attention, not from priority of settlement, but from its location. This is a
          full congressional township, and of course, six miles square. Taken as a whole, in point of natural
          advantages, it is inferior perhaps to most of the other townships, though there are parts of it fully equal to
          any other portions of the county. There is much swampy land on it, and a considerable amount of heavy clay
          soil. The swamps, however, are about all susceptible of being drained, and, when ditched, will make the best
          of grass or corn land; and the clay lands are very good for grass, and, when properly tilled, for wheat and
          rye. Cedar creek runs across the northwest corner of the township, and the two branches of Bear creek, rise in
          it, but are not living streams in very dry weather, until after they cross the township line.</p>
            <p>The first settler in the township, so far as I know, was <pb n="131" id="VAA4025-025-2-057"/> William Miller,
          whomoved in, in the spring of 1836. We have mentioned that he and his son Joseph Miller, cut the first wagon
          track from the river settlements through to Cedar creek, below <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName>. This road crossed Jackson Township, from its east line, very nearly to the west one. I have
          mentioned also, in the same connection, the cutting of a road from Shryock's (or as it was then
          called Blair's) mill. I am now informed, by Joseph Miller himself, that this was but a narrow track,
          with the logs still remaining in it, and that the articles brought through on it, were hauled by means of a
          yoke of cattle, and a "backwoods" sled, made in the following manner. A sapling was cut,
          having a fork at the top, consisting of two stout limbs, which were left several feet long. These limbs
          constituted the "runners" of the sled; and the body of the sapling, passing through the ring
          on the ox yoke, formed the tongue. On these uncouth runners a kind of box was fixed, on which the articles to
          be drawn were placed. This sled possessed a double advantage over the more civilized vehicles. 1st, being
          narrow before, where limbs united, and gradually widening backwards, it could "nose" its way
          through the bushes, gradually bending down, and over-riding those that were not too stubborn; and 2nd, it
          easily slipped over any logs that the oxen could surmount. The narrow track, cut for the passage of this
          "lizzard", "alligator", or whatever else you may choose to call it, was
          widened, and the logs cut out, by Park and Miller, for the passage of a cart, as mentioned in our last
          chapter.</p>
            <p>Other early settlers, in the northwest part of the township, were, T. L. Yates, who had sold his land on the
          river and settled where Alonzo Lockwood now lives; Leonard Boice and Adam Hartle, who occupied the tract of
          land now owned by Henry Feigler and said Hartle; the Phillips family, Benjamin Miller, and the above mentioned
          Alonzo Lockwood.</p>
            <p>In the southeast corner, were James Steward, Samuel Henderson, John Moody and his brother David, Wm. Watson,
          sr., John Watson, sr., and their families; Nathan Wyatt and his sons then forming three families; Jacob
          Mowrert (afterwards Justice of the peace) and Willis Bishop. Farther north, on the east side of the Township,
          were Wm. Means, (the first Justice elected in the Township) and his son James, now a township trustee; Samuel
          Tarney; who filled several offices in the Township; Henry Dove, Abram and Amarih Johnson, Wm. R. Moore, <pb n="132" id="VAA4025-025-2-058"/> Wm. McClure, Wm., Squires, Wm. and Mathew George, Henry <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
               </placeName>, Esq., Samuel Guisinger, and Nelson Griffith. Around the center of the Township, the first
          settlers were Mr. Essig, Joseph Walters and Wm. McNabb, Mr. Walters has served several years as County
          Commissioner, and Mr. McNabb in Township offices.</p>
            <p>The untimely death of two young men, brothers, the sons of Esquire Means, was a distressing incident in the
          early settlement of this Township. They were at work together in the clearing and one of them came to the well
          at the house for a drink and accidentally losing the bucket in the well, he went down to get it. There were
          damps in the well, and he fell senseless into the water. The women raised the alarm, and the other young man
          hastened to the well and perhaps not understanding the matter, went down to try to rescue his brother, and
          fell senseless with him. Before they could be drawn out, life was entirely extinct.</p>
            <p>The "hurricane" was another remarkable event of those early times. I think it occured in
          the summer or fall of 1841. A dark cloud arose seeming to threaten a heavy shower, but soon the rapid motion
          and wild confusion of the clouds betokened the approach of a wind storm. It struck the forest about where the
          western line of the farm of Joseph Woolsey, deceased, now is; and, from thence, leveled the timber, with
          scarcely any exception. William and Mathew George, Henry <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
               </placeName>, Nelson Griffith, and perhaps one or two other men, were working on the road west of where Mr.
          Karper now lives, about eighty rods from the residence of Henry <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
               </placeName>. The cabin of Mr. Karper had been raised, but he had not yet moved in. The men seeing the storm
          coming, and the air darkened with the limbs of trees which the wind was carrying towards them, and hearing the
          continual roar of falling timber, ran with all their speed to the house of Mr. Brown where his children and a
          daughter of Wm. Monroe were, and rushing in, they seized the children, and carried them into an open field; at
          once, the storm was upon them. They had to hold by stumps to keep from being blown away. In the hurry of the
          moment, one child and the young woman had been left in the house, and fortunately, by some means fell through
          the floor. The wind lifted the door from its hinges and threw it over them, and then the logs of the house
          came tumbling in, upon them, until the house was leveled, and even the foundation logs turned <pb n="133" id="VAA4025-025-2-059"/> over, yet the young woman and child were uninjured! Those in the field did not all
          escape so well. The cabin of Mr. Karper was leveled to the ground, and the weight poles were blown beyond Mr.
          Brown's house (some forty rods or more away). One of the knees from the roof of this cabin, it is
          supposed, struck Leander <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
               </placeName>, a boy of Henry <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
               </placeName>'s, making a dreadful gash in his head, which became a running sore for months. He is now
          a young man, and for years has been nearly blind from the effects of the wound, as is supposed. The storm,
          having thus demolished these houses, and scattered the fences like feathers over Mr. Brown's
          improvement, rushed on like a demon, tearing the heavy forest to shivers in its course, and carrying away the
          upper part of Wm. and Mathew George's dwellings, and totally demolishing all their fences. Again it
          struck the forest beyond these farms, and leveled it totally in its course, as before, until it reached the
          tract of land now owned by James Draggoo, where he formerly lived in Concord Township, when, either exhausting
          its force, or rising higher in the air, it ceased its work of terrific destruction. Articles of bed clothing
          from Mr. Brown's house were carried more than two miles by the tornado. The width of its path of
          destruction was about half a mile, and its length three miles.</p>
            <p>After the fury of the storm was over, Mrs. William George started to Mr. Brown's (about half a mile
          westward, with a plain road, before the storm) but was so bewildered by the wild confusion of fallen timber,
          that she lost her way, and, after exerting herself to the utmost of her strength—doubled by her
          terrible excitement, finally arrived at Geo. Moore's, one mile south of her residence. On reaching
          this house, she swooned away.</p>
            <p>Though much of this fallen timber has been cleared up on the farms of Mr. Woolsey, Mr. Brown, Mr. Karper, the
          Messrs. George and Isaac Culbertson, &amp;c., and though much of it has been rotted or burnt where the
          land has not been cleared up; and though a new growth of timber has arisen to hide the
          desolation—yet the pathway of this storm is still very plainly to be seen on the road from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName> to Spencerville.</p>
            <p>Jackson Township, has rapidly improved since its first settlement. Large farms are seen in every part of it.
          Good buildings have been erected as fast as could be expected, considering the dearth of saw mills, convenient
          to the most of the Township. Five churches have been erected within its bounds, <pb n="134" id="VAA4025-025-2-060"/> viz; two Episcopal Methodist, two Methodist Protestant, and one Lutheran. All
          however, excepting the Methodist Protestant churches, are log buildings. That one is frame. The school houses
          too are all log, and most of them rather inferior. Schools, however, are kept up in all the school houses,
          probably six months in the year. Quite a number of tracts of land were sold by the State, as swamp land, and,
          if the State would fulfill its agreement, and ditch them it would very materially benefit the Township, not
          only by draining these tracts, but also by giving the land owners near by an opportunity to drain theirs.</p>

                  <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
               </placeName> Township is the southwestern-corner township of the county. It is six miles square, and was
          organized as a civil township, September 5th, 1837. It has Cedar creek (the largest stream, except
            <geogName>St. Joseph river</geogName>, in the county) running across the northeast corner of the township;
          Little Cedar from the north down through the center; and Black creek a smaller, but never failing stream,
          through the west part. It is well supplied with living water. The land in this township is generally rich,
          and, along the streams, pleasantly undulating. Between the streams there is some flat, wet land. Taken
          altogether however, it is quite a good township of land.</p>
            <p>The first settlers consisted of Peter Fair and his sons, Abram and Charles; Charles F. C. Crouse, George
          DeLong, and Andrew, Jacob and John Surface. These eight came into the township first in October, 1834, with a
          four-horse team and wagon. They had to cut their own road from Squire Caswell's, in <placeName>

              enough to supply that. In this, however, we were mistaken. We found deer quite scarce in those woods that
              fall. One day, Andrew Surface found a hollow tree (on Black creek where Peter Simon's ashery now
              stands) filled with honey, into which a bear had gnawed a hole and <pb n="135" id="VAA4025-025-2-061"/>

              the honey. We (eight) ate all the honey we wanted for twenty days (and we had but little to eat except

               </placeName> Township that Wesley Park and Joseph Miller lay out in the woods on a rainy night with
          "new milk fresh from the cow" for their entire bill of fare, surely it might have been said

                  <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
               </placeName> was "a land flowing with milk and honey".</p>
            <p>But let us hear Uncle Abram's "Coon story"—wish I could tell it on paper as he
          did orally—with his expressive jovial countenance and an occasional interlude in the form of a
          hearty laugh—wish I could, but I can't: <quote rend="blockquote">
                  <p>After finding the bee trees, Andrew Surface found a hollow tree with two "coons" in it,
              and cutting them out, he brought them to our shanty. We took the hides off, and hung the meat out in the
              frost over night, and in the morning, Charley Crouse, who was our cook, prepared them for our breakfast.
              Being rather meat-hungry, we all ate heartily of them, except John Surface, who declared he would starve
              first— though he ate some of the gravy. After breakfast, we all went at cutting and hewing logs
              and making clapboards for William Surface's cabin. John and I went to sawing a large oak for
              clapboards. John didn't pull the saw very strongly. "Ah," said I to him,
              "you didn't eat coon or you could have sawed better". Presently he thought the
              saw went too hard and that he must have the iron wedge from the shanty to drive in the kerf. My father,
              Peter Fair, was lying in the shanty and John supposed he was asleep. So he went to the skillet where there
              was a quarter of a "coon" left from breakfast, and taking off the lid, he took up the
              meat, and after smelling it awhile applied his teeth and stripped the bone in short meter. All this time
              my father lay pretending to be asleep, but struggling to keep from laughing. When John returned and took
              hold of the saw again, I remarked to him, that he must have either been eating coon or smellin'
              of it he pulled so much stronger. When Crouse went in to cook dinner my father told the joke and it was
              sometime before John heard the last of the "coon story".</p>

          down. May that event be long postponed. In 1835, besides the families of the above named eight pioneers, the
          Holbrooks, Louis and Lyman, Joseph Stroup, Henry Miller, Michael Miller, and perhaps some other whose names I
          have not been fortunate enough to get, moved into the Township. In the spring of 1836, Wm. Surface, John
          Gragg, and James Bell moved in. The same spring, Robert Work, Esq., was married in the Township, though a
          resident of <placeName>

            <p>Sanford Bassett moved in, in 1837; John Noel, John Emory and Henry Fair, in 1839, and George Ensley, in 1841.
          The Clarks were early settlers in the Township, but we have not the date of their settlement. Two of them,
          Isaac and Stephen, became Methodist preachers in an early day. Isaac has long since gone to heaven, and
          Stephen is still a traveling preacher in the M. E. church. Orrin C. Clark, late Republican candidate for
          sheriff of the County, is quite a prominent and influential citizen of the Township, and has filled several
          township offices ably and acceptably. Wm. Day was the first Justice of the Township. He came into Jackson
          Township in 1836 with his relative William Miller, and afterwards settled in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
               </placeName>, where Henry Hogue now lives. George Ensley was the second. He was elected in 1843, and resigned
          in '44. Wm. Mc-Annally was elected in his place, and at the expiration of his term, George R. Huffman
          succeeded, and has filled the office ever since for that part of the Township. Daniel Moody was an early
          settler, and succeeded Peter Fair as County commissioner. Hon. Robert Work has filled several county offices,
          and was senatorial delegate in the convention that framed the new constitution of our State.</p>

               </placeName> Township has rapidly advanced in wealth and improvements. Having had saw mills convenient, most
          of the early settlers have good buildings on their large farms. By means of a special school tax, good frame
          school houses have been erected in all of the nine districts (if I am not mistaken) and an extra one by
          private subscription in the neighborhood of Mr. Hall and John R. Moody, in the southeast corner of the
          Township. In meeting houses and church organizations, they are not so favored. There are, I believe, but two
          church houses in the Township, and both in one neighborhood. One is a frame belonging to the M. E. church, and
          the other a log one, belonging to the Lutherans, and both are rather indifferent buildings.</p>

            <p>Wilmington Township is the most easterly one of the second tier—excepting Stafford, already spoken
          of. Wilmington is thus described by one of its old settlers, Rev. S. B. Ward: <quote rend="blockquote">
                  <p>It is a second rate township in quality of soil, taking it together, yet it has some first-rate land in
              it, especially along "Big run," a considerable stream running across the north side of
              the Township. For fine oak timber, there is not a Township in the county that surpasses it.</p>
               </quote> I will only add to this description, that as a grass growing township it will equal any excepting,
          perhaps, Jackson.</p>
            <p>The first settler in this township, I am informed, was Mr. Ira Allen, now living near Newville with his son
          Aaron W. Allen, Esq. He came in, in August, 1836, and pitched a cloth tent on an oak hill, on the east side of
          the township. In that tent he remained perhaps a month or two, until he put up a commodious house, for those
          times, composed of oak logs hewed square and "notched" down closely. When he came here he
          was a very large, stout, muscular man, apparently with an iron constitution. Of late, however, for several
          years, he has been entirely helpless, having his limbs distorted and <pb n="138" id="VAA4025-025-2-064"/>
          stiffened with rheumatism. As an instance of the hardships and exposures that probably brought on this
          affliction, we will relate an incident as we have learned it from others.</p>
            <p>Sometime in October, 1836, Mr. Allen went out to hunt his cattle, of which he had a number, and finding them
          far out in the apparently interminable woods and swamps to the north and west, he started home with them. On
          the way, one of his work oxen mired down. After laboring hard in mud and water for some time, the other cattle
          in the mean time getting scattered in the woods again, he started for his tent, but failed in reaching it, and
          lay out through the night, cold and frosty, as it was, and wet and muddy as he was. The next day, John N.
          Miller, an early settler of the same township, while making his way through the wilderness to the land he had
          entered, heard some one hail him away out where he was not looking for a human being, and, on going where the
          voice came from, he found Mr. Allen and his boys laboring to get the ox out of the mire, it having lain there
          all night, and now until the afternoon of the next day. They had forgotten to bring an ax, and had to cut a
          "pry," by bending down a sappling, and cutting it off with a pocket knife while the fibres
          of the wood were thus strained. Getting this "pry" under the beast, they finally raised him
          from his sunken condition but had to roll him several times over before he could find firm footing. The
          commodious block house erected by Mr. Allen was long used as a meeting house, as well as a dwelling; and here
          I often attended prayer meeting and preaching in "the early day". Mr. Allen was then a
          member of the Methodist Protestant church.</p>
            <p>Among the early settlers of this township, besides Mr. Allen, and Mr. Miller, were John Nelson, Christian and <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
               </placeName> Hull, Samuel Eakright, R. R. Lounsbery, B. Bunnell, John Crouch, Joseph Johnson, Aaron Vealey,
          Moses Haines, and many others, perhaps, of whom I am not now informed. Within a few years afterward, quite a
          number moved in, among whom were George Agnew, Elmer French, Moses Pierson, Elder Henry Cherry, Dr. Isaac
          Sawyer, Charles D. Handy (the first Justice of the township), Eli Welch, Otis Bartlett, John Helwig and Elder
          S. B. Ward.</p>
            <p>As we have already stated, John N. Miller now a highly respected citizen of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName>, was one of the very first settlers in Wilmington. We will now give a few items of his experience
          of pioneer life: <pb n="139" id="VAA4025-025-2-065"/>
               <quote rend="blockquote">
                  <p>In the winter of 1836-7,1 took a job of chopping of Mr. Lytle, who had sold out where he first settled,
              and had entered the tract of land since owned by the late William Pryor, in Stafford Township. The job was
              on the river bottoms, where the timber was very heavy. Huge oaks and elms, with enormous tops, being
              rather plenty to get along fast; as I had to take down all the timber, and cut it up ready for logging. I
              only got four or five dollars (I do not now remember distinctly the wages) and was to take my pay in
              potatoes, pork, beans, &amp;c. For potatoes, I paid $1.00 per bushel; for pork, 16 cents
              per pound; and other things in proportion. The price of chopping was low and that of the articles of pay
              high—yet I could not do better, as provisions must be had. While I kept busy on my job, I could
              just about get provisions enough to keep up in the bare necessaries of life, so far as eating was
              concerned; but I had no time to be sick and no rest but the Sabbath. One cold March evening, after
              chopping hard all day, I took a bushel of potatoes and seventeen or eighteen pounds of pork on my
              shoulder, and started for home about dusk. The distance I had to travel along a blind trail, through the
              darkness and brush, was about six miles. Coming to Buck creek, over which a small limber log was placed, I
              undertook to walk it with my load, but fell off in the water, which was high. I then waded through the
              balance of the creek, getting very wet. Cold, wet, and tired, I pursued my journey with my heavy load,
              until the long miles were passed, and I set down my pork and potatoes in my cabin.</p>
                  <p>The worst part of the tale is, that Lytle was not satisfied with my doing the job so cheap, and taking
              the pay in, high priced trade; but he actually moved the stakes first set, so that the lines might take in
              several large elms that were just outside the job; and besides, he wanted me to chop up to a curving brush
              fence, which ran from stake to stake on one side of my square job, including about a quarter of an acre
              more than the straight line agreed upon. My job being finished, as agreed upon, including, too, the elms
              fraudently brought in, I went to Lytle, in his house, to demand a settlement, and the balance of my pay;
              but he refused to pay, unless I chopped up to the brush fence. This under the circumstances, with my hands
              covered with blisters from hard and incessant chopping (a kind of labor I was not accustomed
              to)—this, I say, provoked me almost beyond endurance, and I told him I should take it out of
              his hide right then and there. I was making towards him. His wife screamed, and Lytle turned it off with a
              laugh, and said he would pay me; and thus the matter ended.</p>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>We will here interrupt friend Miller, by stating that this Lytle (as all the old settlers know)' was
          a hard customer. He seems early to have exchanged his conscience (if he ever owned such an article) for a
          gizzard, with which to grind new comers. He was a very profane man; though Bill Mathews always declared that
          Lytle didn't know how to swear, because he strung his oaths together in such an awkward way. And
          surely, Bill was a competent judge of the matter. Friend <pb n="140" id="VAA4025-025-2-066"/> Miller tells a
          good one on Lytle, which [with other matter] I cannot resist the temptation to put down here.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
               <p>I used to go down to Lytle's sometimes on Sunday afternoon, to be there on Monday morning, to
            commence my job. Well, one afternoon, Lytle being an excellent boatman, asked me to take a little ride on
            the river in his canoe. I consented, and tried to help him navigate the craft; but was very awkward at the
            business. This provoked him, and he let out such a volley of angry oaths at me, as I had not been accustomed
            to listen to tamely. In the midst of his imprecations, he set down his pole, with more than usual energy,
            and smack it went into two pieces, while he was leaning on it with all his weight. Plunge went Lytle head
            foremost into the deep cold river. I laughed, of course, and he turned in the water, and threatened to upset
            the canoe. I seized a paddle, and told him if he undertook it, I would split his head. Being in a cold
            element he soon cooled down and came out peaceably.</p>
               <p>In the spring of 1837, I had lent William Rogers half a barrel of flour, for, though six miles apart, we
            were neighbors, as was usual at that time. I expected that it would be returned before needed; but the
            bottom of the flour sack stared me in the face before it arrived. Getting up one morning, I found only flour
            enough for one small cake. I told my folks to bake and eat it, while I went for the lent flour. It was six
            miles to Rogers, and but a "trace" for a road. I set out early, afoot, and barefoot at
            that, and made good speed, thoughts of breakfast spurring me on, until I came to a swamp, round which the
            trace wound. Thinking to gain time, I struck across, expecting to find the place where the trace came round;
            but, the morning being cloudy, I missed the course, and the trail. I traveled on rapidly, however, in what I
            supposed to be the right direction, until the sun broke out, and I found that it was about noon, and I was
            only about a mile from home! I quickly sought the trace again, and passed down it at a rapid rate, until I
            reached Rogers where I got something to eat. Rogers proposed that, if I left the flour, he would bring it up
            on a horse the next day; but I knew this would not answer our wants. So I told him I could carry it, and,
            taking the hundred weight of flour on my shoulder, I trudged back, the whole six miles, without once laying
            it down. On one occasion, the Coates, Roses and myself, being without breadstuff, held a consultation as to
            where we should go to get corn. I was for going to <placeName>
                     <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                  </placeName>, but they thought best to go to the Northwestern prairies. They started to the prairies, and I
            sent $10.00 along. They were gone ten days, and my money brought me ten bushels of corn, the
            milling and hauling of which cost me ten more. So my meal cost me $2.00 per bushel, and much of
            it rotten, as there had been frost on the 29th of the preceding August, killing the corn on these prairies,
            leaving it too green to keep without rotting.</p>
            </quote>
            <p>We will now close Miller's narration. May he long enjoy the competence his industry has acquired,
          and never again eat rotten corn at $2.00 per bushel, nor practice shoulder carting, as he and I had
          to do, in the early times.</p>

            <p>The first marriage in Wilmington was that of Dan Coats and Mary Allen. The knot was tied by <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
               </placeName> Robinson in January, 1838. The bridegroom was, and still is, one of the largest and stoutest men
          in the county. It would be some sport to see him and Uncle Abram of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
               </placeName> take a good natured wrestle. Dan used to be swift of foot, and on one occasion, this gift of
          nature served him a very good purpose. It was that year hydrophobia prevailed to such an alarming extent, that
          cattle, hogs and even wild foxes "went mad". I cannot give the date, but I have the fact
          from good authority, that, as Dan, was passing through the woods, a mad fox attacked him. Dan, rightly
          considering that immediate retreat was his best policy, started full speed, and the fox after him. They had a
          pretty even race, until Dan jumped a large log, and seeing on the other side a good club, seized it, and let
          the fox have the weight of it, and of both his hands, as it came over the log in hot pursuit. This ended
          Reynard's "mad career", and a drop of his blood alighting on Coats' check
          as it flew warm from the head of the fox, burned like fire.</p>
            <p>Before leaving Wilmington, the "hard winter" must have a passing notice; and we are glad to
          be able to present the reader with a graphic description, from the pen of Rev. S. B. Ward: <quote rend="blockquote">
                  <p>The winter of 1842-3 will long be remembered by the early settlers of the county, and especially of
              Wilmington Township. In 1841-1842, quite a number of settlers, of small means, came in, and had raised but
              little to live on when the "hard winter" set in. The fall had been fine, but, about the
              first of November, a light snow fell, which mostly went off soon after. On the 17 of the month, it set in
              cold, with high winds, and some snow. The snow continued to increase from time to time, until it was
              nearly two feet deep on the level, with occasional showers and hard freezes, so that it was almost
              impossible to get about. It snowed a little every day, but one, through February; and March came in with
              the severity almost of a polar winter. By this time, most of the hay and grain were consumed, and hogs and
              cattle were daily dying all over the country from starvation. Some settlers lost all their hogs, and most
              of their cattle before feed came in the spring. Very many had to depend on the browse of the tree tops as
              feed for their cattle, for the last two months of cold weather. ^For the last few days of March, however,
              even this provision of nature was cut off. When all were anxiously looking for the opening of spring,
              heart-sick in view of the sufferings of their poor dumb animals, the sleeper, in his lone cabin in the
              midst of the forest, was awakened on the night of the 27th of March by the continual crashing of the tree
              tops which did not cease until day dawned when to the dispirited emigrant was revealed the cause of all
              the commotion of the <pb n="142" id="VAA4025-025-2-068"/> night. It had been raining, freezing as it fell,
              until the tree tops were broken under their load of ice. That day, and for several days, it seemed that
              the cattle must all die; for, when the trees were cut down for browse, the small twigs, incased in a hard
              coat of ice, would break off, with the ice adhering, and mingle with the snow. Besides this, the cruet on
              the snow was so thick and hard, that the cattle could hardly get about. The wild animals also suffered
              almost as much, seemingly, as the domestic ones. It was nothing unusual to see squirrels so reduced as to
              be easily caught by hand. On election day (1st Monday in April) snow was one foot deep in the thick woods,
              and it was good sleighing on most of the roads. That week, however, sent the snow, in another form, to
              lake Erie or the Gulf of Mexico, and, in a few weeks, herbage began to appear, and hope sprang up again in
              the settler's heart. Shame on that man that now complains of hardships, or that does not thank
              and reverence the hardy pioneer of those forests.</p>

            <p>For a few years past, Wilmington [Township] has been rapidly improving. The completion of the "Air
          Line Railroad", through the northern part, has given the citizens a convenient market, and has
          planted the flourishing town of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
               </placeName>, in the township. In churches, the northeast corner (the vicinity of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
               </placeName>) is well favored. If I am not mistaken, there is a Methodist Episcopal, a United Brethren, and a
          Winebrenerian church, all within two miles of each other. In school houses, the township is rather deficient,
          not in quantity but in quality. One, of some kind, is to be seen in every school district; but they are
          generally of the primitive, "back woods" style of architecture, as yet.</p>

            <p>Union Township is a full congressional township, and the central one in the county. It was organized
          September 5th, 1837; but it then embraced what now are Jackson, Smithfield, Richland and <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fairfield</settlement>
               </placeName> townships. These were severally detached from Union, and organized at different periods, from
          January, 1838, the date of the organization of Jackson, till the spring of 1844, when <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fairfield</settlement>
               </placeName> was organized.</p>
            <pb n="143" id="VAA4025-025-2-069"/>
            <p>This township has Cedar creek running down from the northwest corner, through the center, and out of its
          bounds near the southwest corner. This drains the township pretty thoroughly, though notwithstanding this,
          there are a few tolerably large tamarack swamps in it. These, however, can and will all be drained, and make
          excellent meadows. The northern and western portions of the township are generally rolling and somewhat sandy.
          The southeastern part is more level and clayey. Taken as a whole it may be said to be a rich township of land.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName>, the county seat, is in the southwestern corner of this township. We have already given dates and
          incidents of the laying out and first settlement of this town by Wesley Park. We will now give further items
          of its settlement and improvement.</p>
            <p>The first store opened here was by one Comstock. Owing to "pressure of business" on the
          part of those who might inform us of the particulars, we are squeezed into the necessity of being content with
          this meager statement. Thomas J. Freeman was the next to sell goods. The records of the County Commissioners
          show that his license was eighty-five cents, his capital in trade being $170.</p>
            <p>Freeman "held forth" in the old frame immediately west of Wesley Park's dwelling,
          the same that has lately been newly weatherboarded, and is now occupied as a dwelling by Dr. Goeriz. It is
          said that he used to bring new recruits of groceries from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
               </placeName> on horseback, in a pair of saddle-bags. Parson was the next to sell goods. He kept his store in a
          part of the house now owned and occupied by Mr. Weldin. Freeman's principal source of profit was from
          selling whiskey to Indians and settlers who loved "the critter". Whether Parson sold liquors
          as a beverage or not, I am not informed. Old Mr. Hart kept a doggery near where J. D. Davis Esq., has his
          hardware store. I think it was in the old frame moved back for a shop by George Brandt. After Freeman had kept
          shop alone awhile, he and Nelson Payne formed a partnership. After Freeman and Payne, came Payne and Governor
          Wallace, who kept in the front room of the house now occupied by Mr. William Davis as a residence. It had just
          been erected by Payne. Next came Payne and Ralston in the same room. Afterwards stores and groceries
          "too numerous to mention" sprang up in our goodly town.</p>
            <pb n="144" id="VAA4025-025-2-070"/>
            <p>The first tavern kept in town was by T. J. Freeman, in the same house where his store was. A few years
          afterwards, he built the house now known as the "<placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
               </placeName> house," and removed into it. At quite an early day, J. O. P. Sherlock kept tavern in the
          old frame now owned and occupied by John N. Miller at the foundry. In spite of his regard for the
          "relics" of the early times, I fear that when John finishes his new gothic, this venerable
          building will go "the way of all the earth". Parson also kept public house in the same
          building where his store was.</p>
            <p>Some tell me that the first lawyer in town was one W. Smith—of the respectable family of John
          Smith, or his cousin "Bill", so often mentioned in the newspapers; while others tell me
          there never was a lawyer of the name here.</p>
            <p>"Who can decide when doctors disagree?" Certain it is that Judge Mott was the second lawyer
          to locate in town. He came in the fall of 1843. Judge Morris was next, and then Judge Dickinson, (surely he
          deserves the title with the rest, having occupied the bench as circuit Judge <hi rend="i">pro tem.</hi> during
          several sessions). Judge Dickinson, I say came next, and here we close the list of pioneer lawyers. Morris
          came in the fall of 1844, and Dickinson perhaps a year after.</p>
            <p>Judge Mott informs me that, after Messrs. Beck &amp; Mc-Crum, of Richland township had built the first
          school house in town (the old one just west of Stiefel &amp; Wolf's store) the court was removed
          from Park's cabin to the school house. A rough platform of boards was erected at the end for a
          "Judgment seat"—a fence of unplaned boards fixed across for a bar, and the house warmed by
          an old cracked stove that made such eloquent pleas, whenever a fresh supply of fuel was put in, as to move the
          whole court and bar to tears, not excepting even the hardest hearted lawyers, with "eyes unused to
          weep". On such occasions, to give vent to the deep emotions of the court (or perhaps to give vent to
          the smoke) the door of the house had to be opened.</p>
            <p>At that early day clients were rather scarce. People generally had little or nothing to go to law about, and
          still less to pay lawyers' fees, and very little time to spare from their strenuous efforts to get
          the necessaries of life, to spend in court. A few, of late years, seem disposed to make ample amends for this
          neglect of the members of the bar. Judge Mott informs me that his first winter in town was spent in the <pb n="145" id="VAA4025-025-2-071"/> honorable employment of village schoolmaster. The following anecdote of
          Judge M [orris] comes second-handed from the Judge. He was at home, rather "hard up" for
          funds, as was fashionable in that day, and his wife being in rather poor health, he was scrubbing the house
          with coat off, sleeves and pants rolled up, and in a perfect deluge of sand and suds, when up stepped a
          gentleman, from the vicinity of Enterprize, and enquired where "Lawyer Morris" was to be
          found. The man with the mop modestly replied that Morris was his name, when the stranger, eyeing him askance,
          told him that he had a case before squire somebody, in which "old Doc Ladue" was his
          antagonist, and that he wanted to get two good lawyers on his side "being as the old Doc was rather
          crafty." During this short speech, Morris was a deeply interested auditor; and, when it was finished,
          he quickly laid aside his broom and mop, rolled down his sleeves and pants, put on his "fix
          ups" dressing his "lower extremities" with one boot and one shoe, for want of
          mates, and in a very short period, he and Mott were on the trail for squire somebody's, away up in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
               </placeName>. Ten dollars was the fee received, and perhaps never a X came more opportunely. Relating the
          above to Judge Mott, as I heard it, he remarked that chills and fevers prevailed to such a distressing degree
          often, in the early history of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName>, that there was scarce a man but that, at some periods, was under the necessity of plying the
          mop, handling the skillet, or bending over the wash-tub; and that owing to the above cause and to the fact
          that female help was like the man pursued by the learned constable—"non come at
          ibus," he himself has been compelled, for two weeks at a time, to perform all kinds of household and
          kitchen service. Mott, Morris and Dickinson have all succeeded well in their profession, not only acquiring
          honorable names, but also a competence of "world gear."</p>
            <p>Judge Mott states that when he came to town, in the fall of 1843, the public square around the court house
          was partially logged, but not burnt off. That the frame of the court house was up but not enclosed. That Main
          street was full of logs from the site of the Auditor's office to Ingman's where
          Long's Hotel now is; and that all west of this was woods up to Stiefle &amp; Wolf's
          corner. He lived in a cabin put up by James Cosper, where Ralston's dwelling now is, and had only to
          jump over the fence in the direction of where Charles Stimely now lives, to chop his firewood from the forest.</p>
            <pb n="146" id="VAA4025-025-2-072"/>
            <p>Payne had an ashery where my residence now is, and all, between that and Mrs. Poffenberger's was
          woods. Houghton lived in the cabin now used as his shop, and John F. Coburn on the lot where Nathan Johnson
          lives; but Mr. Mott could not see their houses from his for the forest that intervented.</p>
            <p>The first physician I am informed was Dr. Ross. Old Mr. Haynes, now of Richland, used also to pretend to some
          knowledge of the healing art, when he resided in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName> at a very early day. One of the oldest settlers says he (Mr. H.) preached some, practised
          some—not christian, but medical practice reader and—and—I'll not
          tell the rest I believe. The old man's practice was on the root and "yarb" system.
          Next came Dr. Cooper, skillfully <hi rend="i">hooping</hi> up the human frame. (Pardon me ladies, I protest
          against any construction of the above miserable pun that will seem to infer any illusion to the present system
          of "hooping" up the female frame). Next to Cooper came one Eli Pritchard. Next Dr. Oliver;
          then Dr. Roe; then Dr. Hendricks; and lastly Drs. Ford and Dancer, and here must end the list of pioneer
          doctors. Ford is the only one mentioned above who is still with us. Dancer lies lamented in our graveyard, and
          Hendricks, having acquired an enviable reputation as a physician and mathematician, and having served one term
          as County Treasurer, removed to Newville, purchased a farm, and became a most scientific and enthusiastic
          farmer; but he is now one of the principals of Newville Academy—Mr. James Colgrove being the other.</p>
            <p>Rev. Samuel Reed, of the Methodist Episcopal church, was the first regular minister in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName>. He was a young man of superior talents and energy. Rev. James T. Bliss was the first
          Presbyterian minister. He is well known as a very amiable and pious man.</p>
            <p>Having given a list of early "professionals," so far as our information will allow, we will
          now notice the equally respectable mechanical pioneers. It is said that the first carpenter in the place was
          James Hite, who, assisted by Lyman Childsey, put up the frame of the court house. Next comes James Cosper,
          still a resident of the township. Then Mr. Samuel Ralston, our present sheriff, Amos Hutchinson, Mr. Houghton,
          and perhaps others of whom we are not informed.</p>
            <p>The first cabinet makers were Lancelat Ingman and J. O. P. Sherlock. John Johnson comes next in this line,
          and is still driving the plane and turning the lathe among us. He informs <pb n="147" id="VAA4025-025-2-073"/>
          me that, when he came on first, he lived in the house of Mr. Ingman now Long's hotel, and, for two
          winters (1844-1845) cut his wood from the forest about where James Griswold's grocery is.</p>
            <p>The first blacksmith, I am told, was Nelson Payne, afterwards merchant and Judge. He had his shop about where
          the old shingle machine now is, near the saw mill. The second "son of vulcan" was Henry
          Moneysmith, who recently died in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
               </placeName>. His shop was near where Mr. Johnson's cabinet shop now is. The first gunsmith was Isaac
          Savage; the second Charles Stimely, who came early, and still follows the craft. The first wagon maker was
          Jonathan Hall, an early settler and still a respected resident of town. The first shoemaker was Cyrus Smith,
          brother of Isaac B. Smith of Smithfield, (then Forshee), then Stephen Latson, who still has his <hi rend="i">awl</hi> invested in the business and will probably follow it to the <hi rend="i">last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bolinger and Carpenter followed the manufacture of fanning mills at an early day. Bolinger is still with us,
          but, probably failing to raise the winds, by that means, as he desired, he has abandoned the trade. Wm.
          Abright was the first saddle and harness maker, and still keeps a shop. Isaac Jones sr., was the first
          manufacturer of tin ware; then Abram Bass and Harrison Jones, then Mr. Tridell, and then J. D. Davis Esq., who
          now monopolises the business. Joseph Garver followed the trade of hatter for a time, at an early day. He owned
          and lived on the lot now occupied by T. R. Dickinson Esq.</p>
            <p>Outside of the town, Kneeland Abbott, on the south, was a very early settler. Daniel Altenburg Esq., and Mr.
          Wals-worth, on the east, moved in, in 1838; and John Summers and Lyman Childsey in 1841, southeast of town. To
          the north, the Husselmans and McEntaffers were the first settlers. Mr. Henry Willis of Richland, states that,
          at the raising of John Husselman's barn, nearly all <placeName>
                  <region type="county">DeKalb county</region>
               </placeName> seemed present and yet it took two days to raise it. On the northeast, Messrs. Rockwell and
          Morningstar were the first settlers. This "morningstar" however, was the harbinger of a
          prosperous day of improvement for that region—now the residence of the Strows, Fulk, Baughman,
          &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As Messrs. Altenburg and Walsworth were among the very earliest settlers in the township, outside of the
          town; perhaps a few items of their pioneer experience might be interesting.</p>
            <p>They moved in together, having left Stuebenville in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Steuben</settlement>
               </placeName>
               <pb n="148" id="VAA4025-025-2-074"/> county, on the morning of the 4th of November 1838, in the midst of a
          very heavy fall of snow, which continued all day. Having a narrow, blind, crooked track to follow, without a
          house for nine miles, the snow flakes falling so fast as to bewilder the traveler, and at sometimes weighing
          down the bushes across the track, it became necessary for one of the men to walk before the teams, to find the
          way and remove the bushes overhanging it. They also had some stock to drive, and, their help being rather
          scarce, the women were under the necessity of walking, and assisting to drive them. The snow being soft and
          hanging on the bushes, those on foot became completely wet. On—on the slow ox teams passed, through
          snow and mud, along the crooked narrow path, until night came on, and still all around was a bleak snow clad
          forest. They began to think of lying in their wagons for the night, but, having no way of making fire, and
          nothing for their teams or stock, and the women and children being frightened by the howling of the wolves
          around them, they drove on in the darkness occasionally stalling against the trees on each side of the narrow
          track. At length one of the teams, and the wagon, got entirely out of the way, and so entangled among the
          trees and logs that the wagon had to be left. Hitching both teams to one wagon, they drove on until they began
          to think they must be near to the only dwelling between <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Steuben</settlement>
               </placeName>-ville and <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName> (Isaac B. Smith's). Stopping the teams, Mr. Altenburg proposed that all should unite in
          one desperate yell, in order to find out whether any human being was near. Loud and shrill arose that cry on
          the almost midnight air, but the loud howl of a pack of wolves, whose name appeared to be legion, was the only
          reply. After holding their breath in silence awhile, Mr. A. proposed that they should tune their throats anew,
          and pitch their voices a note or two higher, and even <hi rend="i">pinch the baby</hi> (now Mr. Henry
          Altenburg) that he might join his voice with theirs. This effort was successful, and Mr. Smith came to their
          rescue with a light, and welcomed them to the hospitalities of his little cabin; for, although about full
          already, he still had room for two families. The cabins of the pioneers always could hold a few more, in case
          of emergency, let them be ever so much crowded.</p>
            <p>The next morning, bringing up the wagon left in the rear, they started on, and succeeded in driving all of
          three miles, through mud and snow, before dark reaching a little board <pb n="149" id="VAA4025-025-2-075"/>
          shanty put up by Mr. Park for two men to lodge in, who were building a bridge over Cedar creek, where Union
          town now is. During the day, they caught a "coon", and on it they feasted the following
          morning; the two families and the two bridge builders having somehow contrived to stow themselves away for the
          night in the little shanty. In the morning the question was, how to get down the high steep bank of the creek
          with the loaded wagons. This feat was accomplished by running poles under the body of the wagon and between
          the spokes of each wheel, so as to lock them all, and then hitching a yoke of oxen to the tongue to hold back,
          and another yoke to the hind part of the wagon to pull back; the oxen hitched behind making, of course, a
          desperate effort to prevent being dragged down.</p>
            <p>To be as brief as possible, they settled for a while in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName>, and in January moved into Altenburg's cabin, three miles east of the village. The cabin
          was without chimney or "daubing," and the wolves serenaded them nearly every night.
          "From the first of January until about the 19th of March," says Mr. Walsworth, "our
          women saw no human being but their own families, except one man strayed in, "The first night I lay in
          my cabin," says Mr. Altenburg, "was before we moved in. Dr. Goodell and Walsworth's
          son were with me. The wolves were howling around, and the "Doc" would not consent to lie
          down to sleep, unless we kept guard, promising to wake up at midnight, and guard us while we slept the balance
          of the night. As soon as he went asleep, however, we lay down and soon all were asleep; the
          "Doc" not even dreaming that his precious life was thus left all unguarded. Other incidents
          might be related, as told me by these pioneers—of a five days' journey to Union mills for
          breadstuff—cutting their way as they went through the woods; of a night job of road cutting, from
          dark till midnight, to get a load of provisions through, from near where Wm. Clark of Union now lives, to
          where they themselves settled, and still live; guided by a small compass set in a watch key, and driving two
          yoke of cattle so exhausted that they would lie down every little while, and then had to be fed and coaxed up
          again; of hard chopping all day, and then tramping down to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName>, three miles through swamps full of water, and then back with a bushel of potatoes on their
          shoulders—making the trip mostly in the night, so as to be chopping again by break of day,
          &amp;c, &amp;c. Most of these <pb n="150" id="VAA4025-025-2-076"/> incidents would be interesting, had
          we not spun out our chapter already to such a length.</p>
            <p>Mr. Altenburgh has lost an arm, and came very near losing his life, in conquering the forest giants. When
          chopping off a "clearing," a tree fell on him, breaking his arm and some ribs. Two
          amputations and a year of the most intense suffering, was the result—and to this day, a severe
          neuralgic pain remains as the consequence of the accident.</p>
            <p>Union township has improved equally as fast as any other in the county. <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName> has continued steadily to increase in size and wealth; and now the "oldest
          inhabitant" estimates its population at twelve hundred. We have four dry goods stores, two shoe
          stores, four groceries, one hardware store, one drug store, one foundry, three blacksmith shops, one
          gunsmith's shop, three cabinet shops, three saddle and harness shops, one cooper's shop, one
          tailor's shop, and carpenter's shops innumerable. We have two printing offices, from which
          are issued two respectable looking weekly papers, four good physicians, eight lawyers, four minister
          &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There are two good church houses in town. One grist mill, one saw mill and "lots" of other
          conveniences among which our Union school stands pre-eminent as an honor to the place. The inhabitants in
          general are moral, peaceable and benevolent.</p>
            <p>Waterloo in the North part of the township, is quite a brisk growing village on the Air Line Railroad.
          Business is rapidly gathering to that point, and the inhabitants are generally moral and enterprising.</p>

            <p>Richland Township is a full congressional Township It has Little Cedar running diagonally from the northwest
          corner, by the center to the south line about midway of said line east and west. The surface of this Township
          is generally rolling, and, in places, even hilly. The soil is chiefly somewhat sandy, though there are, in
          places, considerable tracts of clay. Beech and sugar maple are the prevailing [kinds of] timber; yet
          interspersed with these, there is a good supply of walnut, poplar, oak and ash.</p>
            <p>The first settler in the Township was Joseph Miller, mentioned heretofore. He settled on the farm where he
          still lives, in August 1836, having cut his way in from where his father <pb n="151" id="VAA4025-025-2-077"/>
          lived, in Jackson Township. Previous to moving in, he cut the logs for his house in one day; made the
          clapboards the next, having to chop off the timber two clapboards lengths (for want of a saw) then split it
          into bolts, and chop them in two before riving. He and two others put up the house without any further
          assistance, on the third day. He, Mr. VanSickle, and Obadiah Whitmore also put up a house for Jacob Weirick,
          without any other help. Jacob Weirick and Joshua Feigler moved in, in October 1836. At the organization of the
          township, Mr. Weirick was appointed supervisor for the whole of it; and at the first election, there were but
          six voters in the Township. Wm. Showers was elected the first Justice, William, Solomon and Daniel Showers,
          Lyman Green, James Mc-Crum, Wm. Beck, Daniel Webber, Henry Willis, Calvin and Erastus Corcans, Heman Bangs,
          Japhet Ingraham, Peter Freish, Ezra, William and John Connelly, Thomas Daily, Timothy John and Harvey Moody,
          James Blake, Samuel Haynes, and Peter Moody, were all early settlers, and the majority are still citizens of
          the Township.</p>
            <p>Henry Willis moved in by way of Isaac B. Smith's who seems to have kept a kind of
          emigrant's hotel. From Smith's he had to cut his own road, requiring all day to get through.
          He states that, soon after coming on, he tried in vain to find a pig to buy in the whole county. By way of
          commendable retaliation, he is now trying to excell the whole country in raising swine—witness the
          premiums at the last agricultural fair. Happily for him, he settled on a sugar-timbered tract of land, where
          he had the opportunity of making maple sugar, which he took off, sometimes a three day's journey, and
          exchanged for bread-stuffs. This was a very common expedient with the first settlers. Messrs. Altenburg and
          Walsworth tell me that they pursued the same traffic, much to their advantage in union; and, but for sugar and
          saw-logs, I do not know what the settlers on the river would have done to relieve their very pressing wants.
          It was well indeed that they had this means of sweetening their bitter experiences of pioneer life.</p>
            <p>Peter Moody settled quite early away up by the north line of the Township, where he enjoyed for a time the
          ardent wish of Cowper, viz., "A lodge in one vast wilderness."</p>
            <p>Doubtless, could I see and converse with more of the Richland pioneers, I might get some more incidents to
          enliven this dull chapter; but time and circumstances will not allow me to <pb n="152" id="VAA4025-025-2-078"/> wait for further revelations. As it is, however, though with reluctance, I must let these few items in the
          early history of Richland suffice, and, I heartily thank those two pioneers, Miller and Willis, for the items
          furnished.</p>
            <p>Richland Township has fully kept pace with the others, in the march of improvement. Though much of its
          fertile land fell at first into the hands of non-resident speculators, yet a judicious system of taxation,
          compelled those "land-sharks" to sell out to actual settlers, who have subdued the very
          heavy forests, and are now receiving a rich tribute from the fat soil. Under the administration of the
          excellent board of township trustees, good frame school houses are being erected in every district. The Air
          Line branch of the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
               </placeName> and Northern Indiana Rail Road runs through the northern part of the township. Since this road
          has been completed, Mr. Hines has laid out the village of Lawrence, (Iba P.O.) and, by a liberal system of
          donating lots to actual settlers, and of furnishing lumber for building, from his good steam saw mill, he has
          caused it to improve with great rapidity.</p>
            <p>Corrunna is another village in this Township, on the Rail Road. If I am not mistaken, James Blake, Esq., is
          one of the principal men engaged in pushing it ahead. If a good country around these two villages and
          energetic, thorough going proprietors can make them cities, surely that will be their final destiny.</p>
            <p>There are three good steam saw mills, and at least two propelled by water, in the township.</p>
            <p>Two churches have been erected in its bounds, viz., one a Baptist of the back-woods, gothic style of
          architecture; and one belonging to the United Brethren, a comfortable frame. The school houses, however, are
          all, so far as I know, open for religious meetings. Richland is undoubtedly destined to become as its name
          denotes, one of the richest in the county. I must now close this chapter. Look out for me next in the East, as
          before; but with the narration of a settler on the <geogName>St. Joseph river</geogName> as early as the year

               <p>Mr. Widney:—Since you are writing sketches concerning the early settlers of the various
            Townships of this county, for the benefit of posterity, I feel it a duty to add my mite; so please have
            patience, as I must go out of the bounds of the county, and also note some things that happened before any
            settlement of <placeName>
                     <settlement type="city">DeKalb</settlement>
                  </placeName>, though they are inseparably connected with its settlement.</p>
               <p>Samuel Houlton (my oldest brother) and Isaiah Hughes went into copartnership to build a saw mill, in the
            wilderness of Fish creek, in February, 1827. The firm hired David Williamson, John Kilgore, Francis A. Blair
            and myself to work for them. They gave us axes, a little provision, and fire works, and started us where
            Brunersburg now stands to cut a road through northwest to the Indian village on the <placeName>
                     <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                  </placeName> (the present site of <placeName>
                     <country reg="dk">Denmark</country>
                  </placeName>). We started, and the firm was to follow with the team the next day. We cut on till dark, and
            when we stopped to build a fire, behold the flint, which I had put in my pocket to strike fire, was not to
            be found. We were all wet to the knees, and, it being very cold, we all expected to perish without fire. The
            boys threatened to whip me, as they said it was d d carelessness losing the flint. Said I, "Boys
            the night will be dark as <placeName>
                     <country reg="ua">Egypt</country>
                  </placeName>; we must make fire or perish. Let us all hunt and, if possible, find a stone to strike fire
            with." They said I was a fool, to think of finding a flint in those swamps.</p>
               <p>We had worked hard all day, and were tired and hungry, but I well knew there was not a minute to be lost;
            so I started to hunt for a stone, while they went to eating. It was growing dark rapidly. I struck a small
            ravine, followed it, and at last found a little stone nearly round, with no sharp edge. Feeling along
            awhile, and finding no other, I went back, got the "Spunk" and knife, and, after a few
            strokes, had the satisfaction to see it take fire, and soon we had a good blazing fire. The boys, who cursed
            me and were almost ready to kill me for losing the flint, now, with tears rolling down their cheeks, asked
            my pardon. Such is the instability of poor feeble man. We cut the road to the mouth of Fish creek, and the
            team came on. We then went to work and made a pirogue of about two tons burden, and crossing the river,
            built a cabin <pb n="154" id="VAA4025-025-2-080"/> twenty feet square. When our provisions began to fail,
            Samuel Houlton took Blair, and went down the river in the pirogue. They started to go east of the state
            line, on the Maumee. Hughes, Williamson, Kilgore and myself staid. The boat was to be back in eight days.
            Twelve days past, and no boat appeared. It had. rained heavily. The river rose high, the weather turned
            quite cold, and our provisions entirely failed, except a half bushel of dried peaches. Williamson and
            Kilgore concluded to leave for the settlement. We all made a raft of logs for the boys to cross the river,
            and the next morning they started with empty stomachs. Hughes and I went to see them across. They went
            aboard the raft, and started across the river, the water being high, and the slush ice running. At first the
            raft bore them up, but, before they got across, they were three feet deep in the freezing water. They had
            flint and "spunk," but the latter, getting wet in their pockets, was of course useless.
            They scrambled up the other bank; and there they were, their clothes freezing in two minutes, twenty-seven
            miles from the settlement, without food in their stomachs, without any means to strike fire, and the snow
            four inches deep. I shuddered for their fate, and told them to start at a good "turkey
            trot", so as not to freeze, and not too fast, lest they should tire out before getting through;
            and, on peril of their lives, not to sit down.</p>
               <p>They got through, but so exhausted that Judge Perkins had to help them into his door. Hughes and I staid
            fourteen days after the boys left, during which time we had nothing under the heavens to eat, but a few
            dried peaches. We had a gun, and went out often with it to try to kill something, but there was neither
            animal nor bird to be seen,—No, not even so much as an Indian. On the morning of the fourteenth
            day, I told Hughes I would make a raft of logs that day, and leave the next morning. I did so. Next morning
            Hughes accompanied me to the river, to see me start. We both felt sure that Houlton and Blair were coming up
            the river with the pirogue, and I was in great hopes to meet them in two or three hours. The river was yet
            high, and the slush ice running very thickly. I got some fire and wood on the raft—Hughes loosed
            the cable, and was in the act of handing it to me, when lo! my brother Samuel Houlton called to us, about a
            hundred rods up the river. He knew we must be starving, and came across from the Maumee with a yoke of oxen
            and sled. He had tried hard to reach us the day before, but lacked five miles when darkness overtook him. He
            drove on till he could follow the road no longer, and then struck fire and camped for the night. It was
            fortunate indeed for me that he came just when he did, for, if I had got one hour's start, I should
            as surely have lost my life as I now live; for there was no human habitation till within four miles of <placeName>
                     <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                  </placeName>. The slush ice would have so adhered to the raft as soon to render it entirely unmanageable; so
            that it must have stove [broken up] (and I would have been compelled to swim, or drown. Had I swam out I
            must have frozen to death very soon.</p>
               <p>Now, kind reader, you would think it pretty hard fare to have nothing to eat for fourteen days but dried
            peaches. I tell you it kept soul and body together, and that was all it did. Hughes, Samuel Houlton and
            myself staid about two weeks, then Samuel took an Indian canoe, and Went down the river to get his pirogue
            load of pork, flour, potatoes, corn <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-025-2-081"/> and wiskey (for Hughes must have
            his drams)—At <placeName>
                     <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                  </placeName>, Samuel hired a man by the name of Avery, and went a little below where Antwerp now is, where
            they loaded the pirogue, and returned without anything worthy of note. We four worked on some time, and in
            May got the mill ready to raise. Without any further help, we went to putting it up, without ropes or
            tackle. The size was eighteen by forty-five feet. There were five swamp oak sills forty-five feet long, and
            thirteen inches square, and two plates ten inches square; but the middle bent, with the fender beam fourteen
            inches square, was the heaviest.</p>
               <p>At that time there was a large Indian village where <placeName>
                     <country reg="dk">Denmark</country>
                  </placeName> now is, and some traders came among them with whiskey, and made them drunk; so they came to rob
            us. We had worked hard all day, until nearly sundown, when we went to the house to eat supper. The Indians
            came yelling and soon filled the house. They then drew their knives, bows and arrows, and tomahawks, stuck
            their hands into our supper pot—and our supper was gone in a trice. Samuel Houlton drew a large
            poker and was about to strike, when Avery exclaimed: "Don't strike, Sam, or they will kill
            us all." Hughes also told him not to strike, but let them take what they wanted, and he would go to
            the Indian Agent at <placeName>
                     <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                  </placeName>, and make them pay for it. They then acted as true Lords of the soil. They poured out the
            whiskey into their campkettles, knocked in the head of a flour barrel, and also of a pork barrel, and in
            fifteen minutes, flour, pork and whiskey were gone. They crossed the creek about twelve rods off, and camped
            for the night. While they were making their fires, and drinking the whiskey, we rolled out our last barrel
            of flour, and hid it in a brush heap. We also had about thirty pounds of pork hung up chamber, that they did
            not get, and that was all that saved us from starvation. The two hundred Indians fought and screamed all
            night. A better sample of the infernal regions never chould be got up in this world. As soon as we secured
            our barrel of flour, we next resolved that, when they had generally got drunk, we would alight on them with
            a vengence, and kill the last one of them. So we loaded our four guns with slugs, and then got two tomahawks
            and two hand axes, and waited till they would become more drunk. In this however we were disappoint ed. They
            did not seem to get more intoxicated. After drinking twenty gallons of whiskey, eating two hundred and
            thirty pounds of pork and using up about two hundred fifty pounds of flour, with several bushels of
            potatoes, they started off, about eight o'clock in the morning, well satisfied with what they had
            done. We made application to the Indian agent, but never got any compensation for the articles taken. Every
            time I think of the Indian tragedy, I feel thankful that we were prevented from imbrueing our hands in their
            life blood. It was the traders, with their whiskey, that made all this trouble.</p>

               <p>I will now give you a narrative of another danger that I, and three others, passed through. The escape was
            almost miraculous; and do not forget that all this has something to do with the settlement of <placeName>

                  </placeName>.</p>
               <p>In the summer of 1831, Samuel Houlton sent me [John Houlton], and the widow Fee sent her son John Fee with
            me, out to the prairies, with two yoke of oxen and a large <placeName>
                     <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                  </placeName> wagon, to buy a load of provisions. They let Moses Fee, a boy of seven or eight years old, go
            with us. Before this, Sarah and Cynthia Fee were working on the prairies, to help support the family; and
            the old lady sent word for the girls to come home. So we went out, and got our load ready to return; when
            John Fee got a good chance to work a while, and accordingly staid, leaving me, and the girls, and the little
            boy to get home through the woods and swamps, with the teams and wagon, as best we could. We were three days
            and a half getting home, "miring" down several times on the route. The road being narrow,
            and very crooked, I got fast frequently against the trees, and finally told the girls that one of them would
            have to drive the forward cattle. So Sarah came, and drove the team. As we were thus driving along, we came
            to a dead cherry tree, that had partly fallen and lodged on another tree. The wagon ran over one of the
            large roots of this dead tree, and it broke suddenly about fifty feet from the root The top part fell back
            on the wagon, within about six inches of the heads of Cynthia and the boy, smashing the boy's hand
            severely. The body of the tree fell along the road in the direction we were driving. By suddenly throwing
            myself back, I got barely out of its way, and, having screamed to Sarah when I first saw it coming, to run
            for life, she ran with all her speed, the top of the broken tree just brushing her head and clothes. Cynthia
            Fee married William Bender, and she and the little boy mentioned above are now living within a few miles of
            me, and are parents of large families. I married Sarah, the girl that drove the oxen and outran the falling
            tree on the 5th of February, 1833. In September of the same year, I took three hired men, a yoke of oxen, a
            crosscut saw and fro, and came on to forty acres I had entered, and in four days, we four cut the logs for,
            raised, and covered the house where I yet live, in <placeName>
                     <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                  </placeName> Township, <placeName>
                     <region type="county">DeKalb county</region>
                  </placeName>. I also hauled out and buried twenty bushels of potatoes on my land, and left them till we
            moved on, about a month after, and though the Indians were thick around, my potatoes were not disturbed,
            proving that they were more honest than some of their white brethren.</p>
               <p>And now I want to show how the Hughes &amp; Houlton Mill, though in <placeName>
                     <region type="county">Williams county</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                  </placeName>, had a bearing on
            the settlement of <placeName>
                     <region type="county">DeKalb county</region>
                  </placeName>.</p>
               <p>When the mill had been in operation some years, the people began to settle on the <placeName>
                     <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                  </placeName>, and would come to get lumber, often on credit, to build with; and thus the mill aided greatly
            the settlement of the county, though a few miles over the county and state line.</p>

                  <region type="county">Highland county</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, in the summer of
          1834, when the streams were all foaming high, exposing him to [the <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-025-2-083"/> danger
          of] death by drowning, and of a narrow escape from being murdered for money which he was supposed to have, and
          from which [threatened] untimely death, a supposed pistol (which existed only in supposition) saved him,
          &amp;c. &amp;c. Much as we would be gratified to be able to give his entire narrative, yet its length,
          and the bounds we must necessarily give to our "Sketches" forbid. Mr. Houlton goes on to
          say: <quote rend="blockquote">
                  <p>In 1834, John Fee entered the large and excellent farm, of five or six hundred acres, on which he lives,
              and which lies on each side of the line between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Steuben</settlement>
                     </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">DeKalb</settlement>
                     </placeName> counties. Indulge me in telling an anecdote of him. He had been out to the prairies for
              grain, and froze his feet badly; so that, for a long time, he could not wear boots or shoes. So he got the
              Indians to make hi ma very large pair of moccasins, which he wore. One day, after his feet got better, he
              went out hunting, and, after sauntering through the woods awhile, he crossed the largest moccasin track he
              had ever seen. He looked with astonishment at the monster track, and said to himself "what an
              Almighty big Indian has been along here! Its the d——est big Indian that has ever
              been in these woods". About the time that his astonishment and curiosity got to its highest, he
              chanced to look behind him, and lo! it was his own track. Fee's settling there led in others.
              Luther Keep, Charles Crain, Peter Boyer and Charles Boyer were the earliest.</p>
                  <p>When the county was organized, sheriff Park came here, put up notices, for an election for county
              offices, and appointed me inspector. I chose Luther Keep and A. F. Beecher judges. In organizing the
              township, Mr. Keep, being the oldest man, told me that, as I was the first settler, I should name the
              township; and we agreed together on the name of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                     </placeName>. This is a good township; though not so "propitiously" blest as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                     </placeName>, "flowing with milk and honey." True, honey was very plenty yet milk was
              tolerably scarce, till we got some cows in the township. It [the township] is tolerably well provided for
              in school houses. There is one church near the center. It belongs to the Lutherans. Preaching is mostly
              done in the school houses.</p>
                  <p>As Mr. Abraham F. Beecher was one of the early settlers, and on the first board of county commissioners,
              I feel it due to his memory, as he has gone from earth, to relate an adventure of his, and of another of
              our citizens in company. Dr. Pink was living in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                     </placeName>, and the "Blacklegs" of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Noble county</region>
                     </placeName> stole his horse. Beecher and Willard Eddy started on horseback for the tamarack house, to
              look for the horse. Although they did not find the horse, yet they did find about a dozen of the noted
              "Blacklegs" in a barn, distributing their counterfeit money to their runners. They had
              quite a pile of it. Beecher made a lunge amongst them, and grabbed a lot of their money, and started to
              run away; but Latta their president knocked him down, and they got all the paper back. It was certainly
              lucky that the two did not get hurt. They went to a justice to take the law, but the justice was either
              one of the gang, or afraid of his life or property. It was about the time that several barns were burnt in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Noble county</region>
                     </placeName> by the "Blacklegs"—-Pity Beecher's strength <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-025-2-084"/> had not been equal to his noble courage. Pink went out to look for his horse,
              but got nothing but a severe raw hiding from Latta for his trouble and his [Latta's] horse. I
              myself, have lost about two hundred dollars, by the same gang of villains. This Bellfountain road was one
              of the principal routes leading to their nest. About a week after moving on my place in 1833, a stranger
              rode up to my house. He was an awful looking man but carried the prettiest rifle I ever saw. Said I,
              "Stranger you have the nicest kind of a gun. Will you let me look at it?"
              "Yes," said he, and I took hold of it, but he jerked it back, saying that he would not
              trust his gun in the hands- of strangers. He went on, and passed the road several times afterwards. About
              twelve years ago, the people of Northwestern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                     </placeName> took the same man out in the open prairie, formed a half circle on one side of him, and told
              him to run for his life, and they would all shoot at him as he ran. He started and fell dead pierced by
              twenty bullets! Such was the end of John Driscal.</p>
                  <p>And now fellow citizens, when I first moved into <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                     </placeName>, my nearest neighbor was at <placeName>
                        <country reg="dk">Denmark</country>
                     </placeName>, ten miles off. My next neighbor, on the West, was on Jackson prairie, twenty-two miles away.
              I had to buy my grain on the prairies, and take it to White Pigeon prairie to get grinding; and with the
              many mire holes I had to struggle through, and with the vast number of times I had to unload and pry up
              the wagon, and take a bag at a time on my shoulder, through creeks and sloughs often breast deep in water,
              and frequently ice to break at that—it generally took me from two to four days to make the
              trip. Often when away from home have I had fears, lest some blacklegs might murder my wife and child, and
              little sister-in-law, ten years old, and rob the house.</p>
                  <p>But they were never disturbed. I came in with the best of constitutions; but I am now very much broken,
              and afflicted with rheumatism; so that I have to get help to put on my clothes. Of the four of us robbed
              by the Indians, I suppose I am the only one alive.</p>

                  <settlement type="city">Troy</settlement>
               </placeName> was organized, as a separate township, I am not now informed. The date of the organization of <placeName>

               </placeName> was July 25th, 1837, at the first session of the county board. The first settlers, in what is now

                  <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
               </placeName>, were John Houlton, whose narrative was given in our last <pb n="159" id="VAA4025-025-2-085"/>
          chapter; Peter Boyer, Michael Boyer, Joseph Boyer, M. L. Wheeler, old Mr. Waterman, James and Cyrus Bowman,
          Mr. McQueen, A. F. Beecher and perhaps others whose names I have failed to get.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Troy</settlement>
               </placeName> Township is a fractional one—six miles long and two and a half wide. An old settler
          (A. F. Pinchin Esq.) thus describes it: "It is an excellent township of land, taking it all together.
          The northern portion is generally of a clay soil. The central portion and the southeast corner is a rich sandy
          loam and the west corner clayey." Fish creek, enters it perhaps a mile south of the northeast corner,
          and, running down through the center, crosses, at once, the township, county and state line about a mile north
          of the southeast corner of the township. This creek is the largest one in the county, except Cedar. It was on
          it, near its mouth, that Houlton and Hughes erected their saw mill in 1827, as related in our last chapter. On
          it in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Troy</settlement>
               </placeName> township, Mr. Casebeer, an old settler, has a grist mill in operation; and, higher up, Samuel
          Kepler has another; and, at its very fountain (the outlet of Fish Lake) are the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
               </placeName> Mills, owned by Mr. John Fee, mentioned in our last chapter. These last mentioned mills, however,
          are just over the county line, in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Steuben</settlement>
               </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The earliest settlers in this township were Isaac T. Aldrich, George Skinner, Roger and Simeon Aldrich, A. S.
          Case-beer, Asa Haynes, G. Williams, Amos Stearns, R. Reed, Willard Eddy, S. Call, John Casebeer, W. R.
          Herbert, P. F. Beverly, Uptergraff Clawson, I. Clawson, and Peter Helwig.</p>
            <p>I have but few particulars from these pioneers. Mr. Stearns settled in September 1838. He had to go thirty
          miles to post office and mill; viz., to Union mills, <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Lagrange County</region>
               </placeName>. He was sick from the middle of September 1838 till the first of January 1839, and the women had
          everything to do. Deer were very thick in the woods, and one could be "knocked over" almost
          any day.</p>
            <p>Owing to the advantages of water power in this Township (which was early improved), the settlements have
          rapidly advanced in improvement, and so far as I am acquainted, the inhabitants are generally upright,
          industrious and inclined to be religious.</p>
            <p>Smithfield Township lies immediately west of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
               </placeName>, in the northern tier of townships. It has an excellent soil— <pb n="160" id="VAA4025-025-2-086"/> mostly mixed with sand and gravel, with but very little of that flat clay land,
          found in many other parts of the county.</p>
            <p>The first settler in the township was Mr. Isaac B. Smith, several times mentioned heretofore. We have had the
          satisfaction to receive from his lips several incidents in his experience, that can not fail to interest the
          reader. We will give them in the order they occured.</p>
            <p>First, the Horrors of land hunting: Mr. Smith came to Mr. Murrays, at Pleasant Lake, <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Steuben county</region>
               </placeName>, and from thence explored the woods of Smithfield township, to find a piece of vacant land that
          would suit him for a home. Three times he selected pieces, and went afoot to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
               </placeName> (thirty-two or thirty-three miles) and, finding the pieces selected already entered, had to
          return to Pleasant lake and renew his search for a home. The fourth time he returned to the land office only
          to meet another disappointment. Tired in body and sick with hope deferred, he met a man at the land office,
          from <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wells county</region>
               </placeName>, not far from where Bluffton now is, who represented to him that he was building a mill in that
          region, and knew of a very good quarter section of land still vacant; and stated that although he had thought
          of entering it himself, yet he would give way, and let Mr. Smith have it. The Register of the Land Office told
          Mr. Smith that he might depend on the veracity of this man, and accordingly, he entered the tract, and went
          afoot down to where it lay. When he found it, he discovered that he was badly imposed upon, as the entire
          tract was an unbroken cotton wood swamp, boot-top deep with water. He now returned to the land office, and
          told the Register the facts in reference to the land, and was informed that by taking a man with him as
          witness, and examining the land, the man making oath that it was unfit for cultivation, he could have about a
          week to change his entry to another piece of land. Meeting with Mr. Wilbur Powell, now of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fairfield</settlement>
               </placeName> township, at the land office, he prevailed on him to accompany him as a witness. On reaching the
          place, they traced all the lines around the quarter section, and passed through it twice diagonally from
          corner to corner, and did not see a single tree except cotton woods on the entire tract! Returning to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
               </placeName>, for the sixth time, he [Smith] got a newly corrected plat of Smithfield Township, and took the
          trail for the north. Traversing the woods again, in company with two others, he <pb n="161" id="VAA4025-025-2-087"/> selected a suitable tract, but just as he was about striking for the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName> trace, to start to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
               </placeName>, he met with three other men looking around the same lines. He enquired of them if they were
          going to [Fort] <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wayne</region>
               </placeName> to enter land. They replied in the affirmative. He enquired when, and they replied not for two or
          three days; but from the expression of their eyes, he concluded that they were trying to deceive him. So, when
          the two companies had parted, he told his companions that they would have a race for it. Both parties struck
          for the shanty built by Park on Cedar creek where Uniontown now is; but Smith and his friends got too far
          North, and came out to the trace near the site of the present residence of Mr. Smith, and discovered their
          whereabouts by means of the mired ox mentioned in Park's narrative. It was now dusk, and they were
          three miles north of the desired shanty. Passing over these miles they reached their lodging place sometime
          after dark. Their competitors were not there. The next morning they were off before day. Passing down the
          trail at an Indian trot, they ate no breakfast until they reached squire Caswell's some twenty miles
          from where they started in the morning. All this distance was traversed in a continual trot. Mr. Smith having
          gained on his companions some they told him to call at Caswell's, and order something to eat
          "instanter". He did so and by the time the rear came up, breakfast was on the table. Eating
          in great haste, they left their coats, and trotted on arriving at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
               </placeName>—a distance of about thirty miles in all —at eleven o'clock a.m. On
          going to the land office—Lo! the pieces of land selected were entered! After spending about an hour
          in resting and taking refreshments' Mr. Smith started back to look again, and as he was crossing the
          St. Mary's bridge close to town, he met his competitors, also afoot puffing and sweating, <hi rend="i">en route</hi> for the Land Office. He gave them the comfortable assurance that their race was in
          vain, without intimating at all that he was in the same row. He returned that night to Mr. Park's at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName>, having traveled that day over fifty miles on foot. There were two men at Parks that night,
          Reuben J. Daniels and Ira Camburn. The next morning, Mr. Smith gathered from their conversation that they were
          going up into the north regions to look for land, and that Mr. Park was to go with them; for which each was to
          pay him $1. He [Smith] proffered his dollar also for the privilege of accompanying <pb n="162" id="VAA4025-025-2-088"/> them, and of having the assistance of Park in finding vacant land. The proposal was
          accepted, and the result was that Park showed them the tracts on which they afterwards severally settled. It
          was agreed that each should privately mark his first choice of the lands and providentially or accidentally,
          as you may please to consider it, each one marked the tract on which he subsequently settled, and each without
          knowing anything about the choices of the others. It was now Friday evening and Mr. Smith had but one more day
          to change his entry. So he had another race to get to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
               </placeName> before the land office closed on Saturday. This time he was successful, but was nearly worn down
          with fatigue and anxiety. Eight times had he visited <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
               </placeName> before he secured his future home.</p>
            <p>Second, settling and its hardships: It was on Friday the 27th of May 1837, in the afternoon of the day, that
          Isaac B. Smith, Cyrus Smith and Joseph Delong, with their families, arrived on the hill where the residence of
          Mr. Smith now is. There was not even a shanty or wigwam then. To keep off the night dews, they cut forks and
          driving four of them in the ground and laying poles on these, covered them with brush. Under these, they lay
          on the ground on Friday night; and on Saturday put up a cabin (such as the three men could raise) to the
          joist, and again lay under the brush on that night. The next morning they discovered an unwelcome bedfellow,
          in the form of a "massasogga" or black rattlesnake, and, not being very much disposed to
          share their bed with such "natives," they went at it on Sunday morning, and
          "cobbed" up the cabin, and covered one side with black ash bark peeled from the adjacent
          trees. Fixing poles in the crevices between the logs, they laid their beds some feet above the ground, so that
          Mr. "Massasogga" might have the ground to himself. On Monday, they covered the other side of
          the cabin, and the joists with bark, and carrying in some poles for sleepers, laid a puncheon floor. By the
          time the floor was laid, the joists were found to be so low that even a woman (Mrs. Camburn) who afterwards
          settled in the neighborhood, could not walk straight under them. We will not say but that she may have been
          taller than the majority of her sex.</p>
            <p>Whatever may be thought of cabin raising on Sunday, it must be remembered that "necessity know no
          law." It seemed <pb n="163" id="VAA4025-025-2-089"/> fortunate that the cabin was finished as soon as
          it was, for no sooner was the bark roof laid than it began to rain; and for twenty days, there was scarcely
          one that was not more or less rainy. In this cabin, sixteen by eighteen feet, the three families lodged
          together for two months, and then Mr. Delong moved back to Pleasant Lake, and Cyrus Smith put up a cabin for
          himself.</p>
            <p>On leaving <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, Mr. Smith had boxed up five bushels of potatoes, and among them had packed his pots and kettles
          not wanted on the road. He sent the box with other goods, by public conveyance to Adrian, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
               </placeName>. He did not get them to his cabin, until about the first of July, and, on opening the box, found
          them [the potatoes] awfully "smashed up" by the iron ware. He thought it was now too late to
          plant them, but Mr. Park advised him by all means to do so. He planted them on the eighth and ninth of July,
          and in the fall, dug eighty-six bushels from the five bushels of mangled seed!</p>
            <p>We will now relate the hardest mill trip yet: In July following his settlement, Mr. Smith took the ague, and
          had it with but little intermission till the June following. In December 1837, he had it so severely, each
          alternate day, that he was unable to be about. On his well day he could be around, but, of course, was very
          weak. Getting out of breadstuff, it became necessary that, sick as he was, he should go in quest of some. So,
          yoking up his oxen, he started for the town of Gilead, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
               </placeName>, six miles beyond Orland, or "the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
               </placeName> settlement," as it was then called. It had rained much, and the streams were swollen. He
          made his way however, lying by, sick every other day, until he reached Gilead, where he got eight bushels of
          corn, and started back to the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
               </placeName> Mills, in the settlement of this same name. It had now turned "cold as <placeName>
                  <country reg="gl">Greenland</country>
               </placeName>" and was blowing fiercely while the air was filled with descending snow. It was yet
          early in the morning, and he had gone but three-fourths of a mile on the road to the Mill, when the wind blew
          a tree down across the road, almost brushing the oxen's heads. To get around the tree, he turned out
          of the road expecting to come right in again, but failed to do so; and, getting bewildered amid the falling
          snow, he drove on through the openings as nearly as he could in the direction of the
          Mills—on—on—on—for hours after hours, and still no road nor mill
          was found.</p>
            <pb n="164" id="VAA4025-025-2-090"/>
            <p>Mr. Smith had, on his head, a palm-leaf hat, that had been rather a fine one but was now "the worse
          of the wear." While traveling, bewildered, through the openings, a whirling blast whisked it from his
          head, and, the last he saw of it, it was careening on the wings of the wind, rising higher and higher until it
          was lost to sight in a cloud of snow. Having a "comforter" on his neck, he drew the end of
          it over his head, and traveled on. Thus the time past, in continual traveling through the cold stormy day,
          until the failing light told the lost man that night was near. He began to picture to himself the long cold
          night that would follow, in all probability the last he should ever see—or, if he should
          survive—a morning of distressing sickness, to follow the night of suffering—and he all
          alone in the snow-clad forest. Just then the cloud broke in the west and he could see the place where the sun
          set. Striking out in that direction, in about eighty rods, he found the road he had left in the morning and
          the bridge across "crooked creek" about half way from Gilead to the Mill; so he had advanced
          not more than three miles in all his hard day's travel. Place yourself in his circumstances, reader,
          and imagine, if you can, his joyful feelings in seeing the road again. In an hour he was safely housed at the
          residence of Deacon Stocker, father to Leland Stocker, Esq. of <placeName>
                  <country reg="ao">Angola</country>
               </placeName>. Here he lay sick the next day, and on the day following left his corn at the Mill, and started
          for Tull's Mill near the White Pigeon <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
               </placeName>. Here he obtained fifteen bushels of very smutty wheat, which he brought to the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
               </placeName> Mills also. Here at Deacon Stockers again, he spent three days—two of them too sick to
          travel, and the third waiting for his grist. Finally starting for Pleasant Lake, he lay there during a sick
          day, and, on the next day, got a man to go with him to break ice in the streams. By dint of hard work all day,
          they got within a half mile of home; then had to leave the wagon on the trail, turn out the oxen in the woods,
          and "foot" it in. The next day, being the eleventh since leaving home, he got his wagon
          home. His grist, not counting the price of the corn, which was paid for as he moved in, cost him all in <hi rend="i">cash</hi> forty-five dollars!</p>
            <p>R. J. Daniels Esq., was the second settler in the township. The date of his settlement is January, 1838. He
          says: "Two of us put up my cabin, and on the 28th of January moved into it without door, upper floor
          or daubing. There were plenty of <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-025-2-091"/> Indians and wolves. The next summer my
          wife-went to the bed to move a chair, when lo! a massasogga lay coiled up thereon". Perhaps the
          gentleman was endeavoring to scale the bedstead.</p>
            <p>Besides those two already mentioned, the following persons were also early settlers; viz: Phrez Blake; Norton
          Blake; Henry Shoemaker; Thomas Lock; David Martin; Wm. M'Entaffer and George Seiner. At the first
          election, held in the township, there were just enough votes to form a board, viz. five.</p>
            <p>Smithfield is now equally as well improved, according to the time of its settlement, as any other [place in
          the county]. It is doubtless, destined to keep pace with any other in all the elements of wealth and beauty.</p>
            <p rend="center">Chapter XIII</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fairfield</settlement>
               </placeName> Township is in the northwest corner of the county, and is six miles square. It is the most hilly
          one. The land is considerably broken in places, but the soil is very generally quite rich and easily tilled. <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fairfield</settlement>
               </placeName> was the last township in the county to fill up with settlers. This was owing to its distance from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
               </placeName> from the <geogName>St. Joseph river</geogName> and from the county seat. Since the country has
          been settled up and plank and railroads have been built, it is equally as favored with conveniences of all
          kinds as the other townships. To the lover of the picturesque it will be the most inviting township in the
          county, when its long slopes, rugged bluffs, deep ravines with limpid rills, and its lake shores shall be
          properly improved.</p>
            <p>The very first settlers in the township were of the family of Story. Could I have seen them perhaps they
          would have furnished me stories for this chapter. As it is however my story about this township is short. Of
          these Storys there are Augustus, Frederick, Willard, George and Samuel. But as a good story is always
          acceptable these, being, so far as I am informed, all good, their number is really an advantage to the
          township and county. R. R. Lounsbery was another early settler, he having sold out in Wilmington and settled
          in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fairfield</settlement>
               </placeName> quite early. Here, I believe, he found a grave. Wilbur Powell, William and Isaac Wilsey, D.
          Rager, Esq., Hiram Thomas, Phillip Gushwa, John Shook, Henry and Leonard <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-025-2-092"/>
          Hartman, and Miles Allen, were also all early settlers in the township. Others may have settled there as soon,
          but I am not appraised of any others. I have received no incidents of the early days of the township and
          perhaps, as this was the last one to be settled there may be no very remarkable incidents.</p>
            <p>The township was organized in the spring of 1844, there being then but six voters, if I am correctly
          informed. There are now two hundred forty voters in it. This may give some idea of its rapid settlement. <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fairfield</settlement>
               </placeName> Center is the only village in its bounds and there is but little prospect of its becoming a city
          very soon. The railroad passing through a little south of the township line draws the trade to the villages on
          the road. A few years will no doubt make good its name, and fair fields and beautiful dwellings will be seen
          in every part of the township.</p>
            <p>And now fellow citizens I am about to close my sketches. The resources of our country are only <hi rend="i">beginning</hi> to be developed. We have all the elements of temporal prosperity at hand. The soil of our
          county taking it as a whole is decidedly good. The timber is excellent. We have railroad facilities through
          almost the very center of the county, and throughout its entire length. These facilities will perhaps be
          increased by the building of another road hereafter. We have abundant water power in the <geogName>St. Joseph
            river</geogName> and the several creeks passing through the county, and where there is any lack in this
          respect the power of steam is supplying it. Good school houses are being built by most of the townships in the
          several school districts. The <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
               </placeName> Union school and the Newville Academy present opportunities for higher attainments in science.
          Good churches are being erected all over the county by Evangelical denominations and our citizens generally
          are moral, enterprising, industrious and religiously disposed. The health of our county has greatly improved
          for a few years past and will, no doubt, still improve as the country is cleared up and the marshes drained.
          Let us be grateful for the advantages we enjoy, and strive to act well our part as citizens and as christians.
          If we live forgetful of our duty to God, to one another, or to our fellow men at large, no amount of temporal
          prosperity can make us truly blest. May God bless you all.</p>

            <p>The letters here printed were written by young men from <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Carroll County</region>
               </placeName>, Indiana, who served in the Mexican War. Robert H. Milroy and Samuel L. Milroy were sons of
          General Samuel Milroy, a pioneer who lived on a farm a short distance east of Delphi. He was one of the most
          prominent men of his section of Indiana. He died in 1845. Robert H. went to Mexico as the captain of his
          company. He was then about thirty years of age. Samuel L., a few years younger than Robert, became a
          lieutenant and later a captain. Dr. E. M. H. Beck was a friend of the Milroy family, also from Delphi. After
          his return to Indiana he was married to Miss Frances M. Milroy. Dr. Beck served through the Civil War as a
          physician and surgeon, and later practiced medicine in Delphi for several years. After the Mexican War, Robert
          H. Milroy lived at Renssalaer, Indiana, where he practiced law. He went to the Civil war as colonel of the
          Ninth Indiana Regiment. Samuel L. Milroy made his home on the old farm, entered and cleared by his father
          General Milroy, to the time of his death. William E. Pearsons, who writes one of the letters, was a friend of
          Dr. Beck and the Milroy family. He also became a captain while in Mexico. Mrs. A. A. Grimes was a sister of
          Robert H. and Samuel L. Milroy, and the wife of Dr. Samuel Grimes of Delphi. James Milroy, a brother of Robert
          H. and Samuel L., was at home on the farm during the Mexican War as the letters indicate.</p>

                  have all the glory <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-025-2-095"/> of that Battle, they fought like young <hi rend="i">Devils.</hi> I wish we had been in it <hi rend="i">darn</hi> it.</p>
                        <p>I have not received my commission as Lieut, from [Governor] Whit-comb so I have went into the ranks
                  again Davis has not got his discharge signed yet. I don't think that he will go home yet a
                  while, there is nothing worth writing transpires in our camp or I should have written oftener.</p>
                        <p>I should like to hear how you get along with the farm and how much wheat you have got in. You have a
                  great deal of hard work to do I know, more than you ought to do yourself you ought to have a hand. I
                  almost wish that I was there, but am not sorry for the step I have taken. <hi rend="i">persevere</hi>
                  Jim. I writ home by Tailor and sent two strings of shells to Martha, but I have reason to believe that
                  he was lost at sea I also writ a letter to Morg Wilson he has never answered it take the liberty of
                  twiching his nose for me if you pleaz You must all write. And Jim you particularly, giv my respects to

                        <p>Well Jim, Sam has made a mistake and skiped this page [second of four-page sheet] and I have
                  concluded to put something on it just to keep it from looking bad as I have nothing to say of
                  consequence as there has nothing happened since I last wrote you worth mentioning except that two more
                  of my boys have died. Michael Bell and Thomas Landrum the first the 12th inst &amp; the other on
                  the 13th. And 12 more of my men have been discharged. … My company now consists of 61,
                  officers and all. I have sent 6 men to the hospital at Matamoras. We will probably remain at this
                  place [Mouth of Rio Grande] for some time for the reason that our old Jackass of a Colonel gets at the
                  rate of $936.00 more per annum for guarding a separate post than if he was with the brigade
                  under the Brig. Genl. this is a miserable cheerless place &amp; the men are getting homesick
                  &amp; dying from inactivity. We all wish that the devil had our file officers from Genl. Taylor
                  down. Frank Graham has just come into my Markee from Monteray. The Texans are all disbanded and
                  Charles and John McCarty have gone home by land. Frank is on his way to the U. S. &amp; Cincinatti
                  they were all in the hottest of the battle—This is the 19th and is pay day and we will

                  or twa frae me 'ee (Burns)—I never felt happier in my life than day before
                  yesterday after a long absence from bouth you and my Father (for whom I had such anxiety) when 1 reed
                  a long letter from each, containing glad tidings of great joy, health &amp;c, &amp;c. I
                  honestly assure you although you did not receive them, I have written at least <hi rend="i">one
                  letter</hi> per week, to some of your family since my arrival in Mexico, I wrote during
                  Saml's illness. Although I had but a feint hope of recovery at the time, I since told you he
                  had completely recovered. You never saw him so lusty as now. This News, you will have public a few
                  days in advance of this as I wrote to the <hi rend="i">Republican.</hi> We are all anxiety yet. Our
                  Regt. Boarded a steamer yesterday for Camargo, but that instant, [came] an express from the mouth of
                  the river, stating that a large body of troops (Mexican) was within a few miles up stream &amp;
                  meditating an attack— The boats turned and went post haste. The enemy had gone, would not
                  venture an attack. I just reached home, bid good bye to our boys—for they join the 3d <placeName>
                              <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                           </placeName> Regt. at Camargo &amp; go to Genl. Taylor's relief if possible. They are
                  determined to cut through or fall. I hope they will get to him, for they are attempting to starve him
                  out. They have had a hard battle, he is not whiped although surrounded by 20 or 30,000 of their yellow
                  hides.</p>
                        <p>Wm. E. P. [Pearsons] stays here a few days turning over property to the new commandant, then follows.
                  Although we made every effort for my going along, they would not spare me here—as we have
                  about 100 more patients.</p>
                        <p>Genl. Minion of Mexican army sends us word that he will enter our city soon &amp; if we want to
                  spare our throats—to leave for his rule will spare none. We sent him word to drive us out.
                  We now have 800 raw Missipi. Volt &amp; 2 citizens companys and 2 [companies] of 80 each
                  convalescent Hospital patients purposely detained one comp of which I com-m'd, &amp; you
                  ought to see me drill them on this house top. You'r mistaken if you think I wont fight. If
                  compelled to leave, we will attempt to run everything into Fort <placeName>

                           </placeName>, &amp; never give that up. What an excitement in town. We lay on our arms. Nearly all
                  the native citizens have left the city for a while, business nearly suspended, but should Scott get
                  our express, he will send to our assistance. We can hear nothing from Taylor—they have cut
                  off the express, but the reason we think that he gave them the worst of the battle, is, that the
                  natives, here, are not rejoicing— if anything, are a little down in the mouth. Rob is very
                  anxious for a fight—indeed all the boys are on tiptoe to go through, when they know that
                  under the circumstances they will have to remain some time after the year expires. Cap. Pe[a]rsons
                  &amp; I will not promise when we will be home—I like the excitement, &amp; can I
                  continue in employment, will see it out, if its a lifetime. &amp; unless it gets remarkably
                  healthy, I can get employment.</p>
                        <p>Capt. is in fine health and spirits—the men are all in good health likewise. Such is a
                  hint of the times in matamoras just now. Today is Sunday—but you would not think so if you
                  were here. I have written all that is of interest, relative to the situation of things.</p>

                        <p>Your letter of March 1st came to hand a few days since and was read with much pleasure—</p>
                        <p>My chief source of pleasure and pastime during this campaign has been my correspondence with old
                  friends and acquaintances—Every one [letter] I receive brings to my mind the difference
                  existing between a soldiers and citizens life—Not that I am the least homesick or
                  dissatisfied but the remembrance of old scenes and friends furnishes a pastime for the many unoccupied
                  hours of a soldier which are idled away without business, books, or friends, to occupy his
                  mind—But a truce to sentimental-isms and less [let's] rite the
                  news—Since I wrote you last we have moved our quarters from Matamoras to this place
                  (Monterey)—Our march was a pleasant one—Dr. Beck remained in Matamoras in the
                  Genl. Hospital— I received a letter from him yesterday he is in good spirits—</p>
                        <p>About two weeks ago Samuel and myself visited the glorious battle field of Buena
                  Vista—Genl. Lain went with us all over the battlefield, and pointed out to us the different
                  positions of each corps of troops on the field. We you are aware were not in the fight—If
                  we had been I believe the unjust charge of cowardice would never have been circulated against the
                  Indiana Volunteers—Unjust it certainly is for the 2d Indiana Regiment actually done the
                  hardest fighting that was done upon the field and fled only when they were ordered to do so by their
                  cowardly old fool of a Colonel, who after he had given this order joined the <placeName>
                              <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                           </placeName>. Regt. and fought under the colors of another State—telling them that his own
                  Right had fled like cowards from the field and denied having given them the order to retreat. He ought
                  to have a mill-stone tied to his neck and be sunk to the bottom of the Sea—</p>
                        <p>Since Samuel and myself returned from Saltillo Capt. Milroy [Robert] has been there also, he returned
                  last evening—There are no movements of the army in this quarter at present—My
                  oppinion is that the Mexicans are so thoroughly whiped out that they will not fight us
                  again—</p>
                        <p>Our time is nearly expired and we shall soon be discharged to go home without sharing in the honors
                  of one victory—</p>
                        <p>The health of the Company is the best at present that it has ever been at any one time not a sick man
                  in the Company and but few in the Regt. No camp news of any consequence except that last night Capt.
                  Samuel and myself had a flea hunt—We killed about 250 in the blankets that we three slept
                  in—Some of them a quarter of an inch long—Capt. is preserving a few to take home
                  for a show—</p>

                        <salute>Dear Sister</salute>
                        <p>We received a letter a few days ago from Jim enclosing a short epistle from Marth. and a few lines
                  from Sam. Ramey all written about the 1st of March last—</p>
                        <p>Although these letters were a long time coming and the news from home rather old, still they come to
                  us like a refreshing shower to hot parched up country, but see here Mrs. we are not often blessed with
                  these refreshments from you—</p>
                        <p>The last letter we received from home before the one above mentioned was in Feb. last &amp; from
                  Jim also so you see our refreshments from home are like angels visits—and nearly all from
                  Jim. There was a very large mail received day before yesterday by the Regt. and almost every man in my
                  company reed, letters except poor Sam. &amp; me— I felt so vexed that I almost swore
                  not to write home again but I concluded to write one more letter to set you a christian example by
                  returning good for evil and as our time is nearly out (one month &amp; 10 days) I will probably be
                  able to come home &amp; scold before I could do so again by letter— Sam. &amp;
                  myself and indeed every man in my company is in first rate health. The fact is the whole Regiment is
                  now in fine health with the exception of a few men who have partly lost the use of their lower limbs
                  but are otherwise as fat &amp; hearty as ever they were in their lives, this was the case with two
                  of my men that were discharged since they came up here Lewis Yost &amp; Samuel Yeager and one of
                  my men is affected that way now Joseph Mabbit (a nephew of old Jackys) he is as fat as a bear and as
                  stout as a horse but it is with difficulty that he can use his legs in walking—</p>
                        <p>I have no news of any importance to write—We have the same daily routine of military duty
                  to perform each day, the Mexicans seem to be perfectly subdued in this part of the country and mix
                  with us and trade with us as sociably as if they never thought of war, but they are all treacherous
                  devils and there are a great many robers among them who are sculking through the country every place.
                  One of Capt. Lewis' men (of <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                           </placeName>) by the name of George Fry was murdered 4 days ago by them% of a mile from
                  camp he went out hunting in the afternoon and did not return that night, in the morning they sent out
                  parties of men to hunt for him &amp; they found him most horribly mangled, his throat was cut from
                  ear to ear his neck had been stabed through twice and his skull broken in three places, he was brought
                  into camp, washed and buried —The sight of the mangled bloody corps enraged the men very
                  much and it is with difficulty that they could be restrained from killing the Mexicans that came about
                  camp. I saw several get knocked down and kicked. Many of them will have to bite the dust before we
                  leave Mexico— We will remain here probably till out time expires or at least till the 1st
                  of next month. Gen. Taylor tells us that we will be discharged on this side of Camargo or Matamoras if
                  they will have money enough there then to pay us off, if not we will be sent to N. Orleans to be
                  discharged— I hope <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-025-2-099"/> we will be discharged on this side

            <p>In his monograph of one hundred twenty-two pages, Dr. A. M. Stickles has made an interesting and important
          contribution to the history of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName> and the West. In the social and economic background of a pioneer community is set this unique
          struggle between the Old Court Party and the New Court Party. This struggle grew out of the broader conflict
          between the relief and anti-relief factions of the population, which in turn represented the debtor and the
          creditor classes of early <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. The story involves the development of the banking system and its currency, questions of a
          constitutional nature and the relation of State to Federal Government. The struggle was an intense one and
          came to its climax after the panic of 1819, especially during the three years from 1823-1826.</p>
            <p>In the early settlement of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, every kind of money was scarce and exchanges were made by barter or through the medium of furs,
          wheat or tobacco warehouse receipts. In 1802, the State Legislature chartered the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName> Insurance Company and its bonds, notes and bills served the purpose of a currency. In 1806, the
          Legislature chartered the Bank of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. The State held half of the stock, selected half of the directors and chose the President of the
          Bank. Although political influences affected its note issues, the Bank continued its existence until 1822 and
          did a good deal to tide over the war period from 1812 to 1815.</p>
            <p>The Second <placeName>
                  <country reg="-us">United States</country>
               </placeName> Bank, chartered in 1816, had two branches in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName> but was never very popular and efforts were made to tax it out of existence but without success.
          The State in this attempt came better to understand its relation to the Federal Government.</p>
            <p>The profits made by the Bank of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName> stimulated competition and many independent banks were chartered. These <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-025-2-101"/> banks stretched their credit to the limit, issuing millions of dollars in paper
          with a minimum of specie to back it. "Inexperience, dishonesty and mismanagement characterized their
          existence."</p>
            <p>Speculation in land and abundance of products led the western population to indulge high hopes for the future
          and to be confident of attaining wealth. The panic of 1819 broke this bubble, and caused such distress as
          perhaps has never been equalled in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. Bad crops and heavy obligations to banks and merchants coming together created an emergency that
          tried the pioneer population to the limit.</p>
            <p>A traveler passing through <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName> at this time in referring to the situation speaks of "enterprize checked, commerce at a
          standstill and currency depreciated." Prices fell very low and sales were hard to make even then.
          "The whole state grew restless and county meetings to consider relief were held everywhere."</p>
            <p>Relief became an issue in elections for governor and legislature and the advocates of relief came to control
          both branches of the State government. Legislation was enacted, favorable to their cause, moderate at first
          but more extreme later on. Debtors were permitted to replevy for three to twelve months. In 1820 a law was
          passed which gave a debtor two years to pay a debt after it was due. Still more radical was a law which
          prohibited the sale of property on court order for less than three-fourths of its value unless the creditor
          would take the notes of the Bank of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName> or the Bank of the Commonwealth. The Bank of the Commonwealth was chartered by the relief
          Legislature in 1820 and was a relief measure. It was backed by the sale of lands west of the
            <geogName>Tennessee River</geogName>, but it never had more than a few thousands of dollars in specie in its
          vaults.</p>
            <p>The relief party controlled the legislature and the governor but the anti-relief party found support in the
          courts of the State. It was on account of this that the struggle ended in the courts. In 1822, James Clark,
          circuit judge, rendered a decision on a case that came up in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Bourbon County</region>
               </placeName> to the effect that the law permitting replevins was contrary to both National and State
          Constitutions, as a violation of contract. A committee of the Legislature, appointed to investigate, reported
          that decision was "subversive of the best interests of the people and calculated to disturb the
          tranquility of the <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-025-2-102"/> country and shake confidence in institutions and
          measures of the government." Intense feeling prevailed and Judge Clark was removed although the
          Constitution of the State entitled a Judge to his position during good behavior. A similar decision was
          rendered in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Fayette County</region>
               </placeName> by Judge Blair. The case was carried to the Court of Appeals, of which Judge John Boyle was chief
          Justice, and the decision of the lower court was sustained in 1823. These court decisions were not hastily
          arrived at but were the result of careful consideration.</p>
            <p>Again the feeling was intense and an effort was made to remove the Judges of the Court of Appeals, but
          without success. The relief party then undertook to agitate for a convention to amend the State Constitution
          but did not succeed. The election of 1824 strengthened the relief party in the General Assembly and a law was
          passed by a vote of 22 to 16 to create a new Court of Appeals. The debate on this measure was one of the most
          prolonged, able and acrimonious in the history of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName> or of any other State, and both sides were championed by able men. The bill was skillfully drawn
          and created a Court of Appeals to consist of four judges, and with curious inconsistency the salary was
          increased. The positions were filled and the new court began to function. It seized the court records and
          bloodshed would surely have followed had an attempt to recover them been made.</p>
            <p>Thus there were two courts in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName> at once, each claiming to be the legal body. Cases were carried before both courts and decisions
          rendered. The monograph under review by tables, shows in detail the relative amount of business done by each
          court as well as the support of either by counties.</p>
            <p>The Election of 1825 was particularly exciting as each of the court parties made a desperate effort for
          control. All, kinds of tricks were resorted to in attempts to affect the result. Liquor, which generally
          flowed rather freely in those days, was so doctored that many were taken sick and kept from voting. The New
          Court Party was called the People's Party and the Old Court Party was dubbed the Lawyer's
          Party because it had the general support of the legal profession. "No popular controversy, waged
          without bloodshed, was ever more absorbing or acrimonious than the one which raged over <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName> like a hurricane for three years."</p>
            <p>In the General Assembly the Old Court Party kept gaining in each election from 1825 on, and although the
          struggle con-<pb n="177" id="VAA4025-025-2-103"/> tinued the law creating the new court was repealed and the
          old court assumed its former place. It started anew with a heavy docket as many cases had been allowed to wait
          until the struggle between the courts should run its course.</p>
            <p>As a result of this "Critical Court Struggle," the pioneer population learned a good deal
          about finance which affected the future character of the State; they came to understand more clearly the
          relation of the State to the Federal Government, thus overcoming the separatist tendencies of earlier years.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Lincoln the Hoosier.</hi> By CHARLES GARRETT VANNEST. Eden Publishing House, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>

            </head>
            <p>This volume treats somewhat extensively that portion of Lincoln's life which was spent in Indiana.
          From the age of seven to twenty-one, the child, youth, and young man was subjected to the forces included in
          his southwestern Indiana environment. The author declares that his purpose in writing the volume was to prove
          that these forces made Lincoln a Hoosier. He feels that the evidence to demonstrate this has been furnished.
          It seems that other writers, by placing low estimates on the value of the Indiana factors that influenced
          Lincoln, likewise furnished the author with a motive. He desired to prove that the youth of the man, who later
          become one of the world's greatest figures, was not spent in a "cramped cultural
          environment". The book was written with a simple formula for a guide: "Lincoln's
          blood and environment explain him".</p>
            <p>Every chapter of this new work on Lincoln is interesting. No one will argue that his life in Indiana was not
          more deserving of a book than the subjects selected by numerous writers who have felt urgent calls to add
          something to the extensive literature pertaining to the great man. In the main, the author has performed his
          task well. He aimed at completeness, and admits in his Preface that he has "brought together all
          there is to be known of Lincoln's life in Indiana".</p>
            <p>There are chapters on the ancestry of Lincoln, on his <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi> This review is reprinted from the <hi rend="i">Indiana University Alumni

               <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-025-2-104"/> schooling, and on his reading habits and opportunities. The better
          features of the life in the community where the Lincolns lived are stressed. The physical labor which the
          youth was called on to perform and the great bodily strength which he developed are adequately treated. There
          is even a chapter on the slavery question.</p>
            <p>The book is well worth reading, and it should be read and enjoyed by many who are interested in Lincoln.
          Students will find valuable information in it. One wishes that the writer had been leas anxious to prove
          preconceived notions. It would have been much better had he simply told his story, on the basis of his
          findings. His opinions and conclusions, he had a right to state, of course. Perhaps he may be correct in all
          of them, but the historian who pleads his cause too earnestly is not entirely convincing. The seeker for the
          truth can not fully approve an author who consciously sets out to prove something.</p>

          a period in our prosperous manufacturing city, which went through its first boom in the natural gas era, and
          studied all phases of its life. One reviwer says of the book: "Nothing like it has ever before been
          attempted; no such knowledge of how the average American community works and plays has ever been packed
          between the covers of any one book; and I warn you that hereafter nobody has any right to make the most casual

                  <p>Of one thing I feel quite sure. It is not true that machinery is the source of our troubles…
              If we do not plan, if we do not use machinery intelligently on behalf of things we value, the fault lies
              with us not with the machine. This fact underlies, I suppose, the contradiction in our life; with an
              enormous command of instrumentalities, with possession of a secure technology, we glorify the past, and
              legalize and idealize the <hi rend="i">status quo</hi>, instead of seriously asking how we are to direct
              and employ the means at our disposal. This is our great abdication. There is a strain of fear running
              through American life which controls our activities to an untold extent. We dare not act lest we upset
              something. This state of fear will, presumably, endure until we begin to plan our living in a systematic
              and collected way, which means of necessity a collective way.</p>

            <p>In a recent pamphlet (<hi rend="i">Indiana History Bulletin</hi>, volume VI, extra number 1, January, 1929),
          the Indiana Historical Bureau has published a second revision of <hi rend="i">Historical Markers and Public
            Memorials in Indiana</hi>, compiled by Jessie P. Boswell. The Bulletin is a compilation of one hundred six
          pages, and is illustrated by many cuts of markers, statues and memorials. The frontispiece is a picture of the
          chaste and beautiful Indiana World War Memorial, recently constructed by the State in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
               </placeName>. An attempt has been made to record the work done in the several counties of the State in the way
          of designating historic sites and of erecting memorials to persons and events. The head of the Historical
          Bureau, Dr. Christopher B. Coleman, solicits "corrections and additions" in an announcement
          which prefaces the pamphlet. In regard to the historical accuracy of inscriptions placed on markers, the State
          Bureau and the compiler of the pamphlet do not accept any responsibility. Dr. Coleman wisely says: "A
          careful scrutiny would doubtless show that here and there claims have been embodied in stone and bronze
          without sufficient warrant." It should be remembered by all local societies or committees that
          loyalty to truth is a more fundamental virtue than a display of patriotism to the community when based on
          doubtful evidence.</p>

            <p>The history of almost any middle western college is well worth the writing. Several histories portraying the
          struggles, the near-failures, the triumphs, the changes, and the growth of certain institutions of higher
          learning have appeared in recent years. A number of others should follow. Many sectarian and other non-State
          colleges that were founded were unable to survive the vicissitudes of the times. Some of the survivals and
          revivals were little short of miraculous. After being saved time and again by heroic efforts, there were cases
          when life continued to hang only by a thread. There are those that still lead a hand to mouth existence, with
          meagre endowments, poor equipment, and insufficient funds with which to employ faculties.</p>
            <p>The histories that have been written of colleges that are still going concerns have been prepared by authors
          who are friends of the schools dealt with. Such writers are to be commended and, as already indicated, it is
          to be hoped that others will follow their examples. There is a need in addition for sketches of colleges,
          living, dead, and near-dead from the pens of outsiders, who, though just and fair, can be entirely
          disinterested. These must come before we shall have any true history of college education in the Middle West.</p>

                  <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> Historical Review.</hi> A critical evaluation of Rhodes
          as a writer of history was published in the March number of the quarterly mentioned, and a similar treatment
          of McMaster may be found in the June number recently issued. Further articles of the same nature are to come
          in future issues. These valuable papers are the results of studies undertaken by graduate students in the <hi rend="i">seminar</hi> courses of Professor Jemegan of the University of <placeName>

            <p>For the year 1929, the <placeName>
                  <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
               </placeName> Historical Society is offering a prize of one hundred dollars to the person submitting the best
          article on some subject connected with the history of <placeName>
                  <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
               </placeName>. The competition is open to anyone, and the award will be announced in the March, 1930, number of
          the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                     <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                  </placeName> Historical Quarterly.</hi> The announcement includes the statement: "The Society
          reserves the right to publish in its magazine any article submitted."</p>
            <p>The plan here adopted to insure the writing of not merely one but several papers pertaining to the history of <placeName>
                  <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
               </placeName>, is of interest to the <hi rend="i">Editor</hi> of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
          History.</hi> He hopes that some generous member of the Indiana Historical Society will make it possible to
          announce a similar competition in this State soon. He should like to announce an offer of fifty dollars for
          the best article on some phase of Indiana history, with a second fifty dollars to be distributed among five of
          those who, though they do not win first place in the contest, submit papers suitable for publication.</p>
            <p>This <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, which is published quarterly by the Department of History of Indiana
          University in cooperation with the Indiana Historical Society, goes to each member of the Society for the
          nominal sum of one dollar per year—the price of a fair dinner. It seemed to the new and
          unsophisticated <hi rend="i">Editor</hi> that the members of the Historical Society would be very willing to
          increase the annual dues by a reasonable amount, in order that the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> might be granted
          a more adequate subsidy from the Society—perhaps two dollars per member; or if not, at least one
          dollar and fifty cents each. When considering such a suggestion, the Executive Committee of the Society at a
          meeting held early in April went on record as opposed to any modification of the present arrangement. The
          Committee passed a motion to the effect that, "the editor of the be advised that it is the sense of
          the Society that its dues should in no event be increased and in no event can an appropriation of more than
          one dollar be made for the maintenance of the <hi rend="i">Magazine."</hi> The <hi rend="i">Editor</hi> has been in such a daze ever since, in regard to this matter, that he has performed his editorial
          duties with more than his usual docility and cheerfulness. He hopes in time to learn to "make bricks
          without straw."</p>

            <p>The annual meeting of the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> Historical Association which was held at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
               </placeName>, April 25-27, was in every way profitable and enjoyable. The papers read at the several meetings
          were of a high order, the attendance was good, the weather was fine, and the historic city on the <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wabash</region>
               </placeName> did herself proud in caring for her guests. The meeting will be long remembered by those
          fortunate enough to have been present, as one of the best in a long line of excellent meetings.</p>
            <p>Next year the members of the Association will gather at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
               </placeName>, a center of great historic interest. Located at the northern extremity of Lookout Mountain on
          the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
               </placeName> at Moccasin Bend, the city selected by the Association is a splendid place for the annual
          meeting. In an important and beautiful part of the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName>, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
               </placeName> is easily accessible from every direction by railways and automobile roads.</p>
            <p>A few suggestions regarding contributions that may be submitted to the Magazine in the future, may be
          welcomed. As a rule papers written in good English with adequate references to the sources of information, can
          be prepared for the printer with little labor. Such changes as may be necessary are made merely for the sake
          of maintaining a reasonable degree of uniformity in regard to footnotes and other matters of form. Papers
          written hastily with no attempt to furnish references to materials used, require much work before they can be
          turned over to the printer. Very few writers are so expert that they can afford to submit a first draft
          without any revision whatever. It is usually much better to revise the original copy carefully one or more
          times, and then have a final copy prepared for submission. There is no iron-clad rule, but it is customary to
          avoid the first person when writing historical articles, except in papers pertaining to the family of the
          writer or to intimate personal matter such as holds a place in reminiscences or autobiography. In all other
          historical writing, it is better to present the narrative in the third person, unless there is some very
          specific reason for variation. Unusual care should be used in the spelling of names of persona and places,
          since it is frequently difficult for anyone other than the author of a paper to correct such errors even when
          suspected.</p>
