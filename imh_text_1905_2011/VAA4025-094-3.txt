                    I only regret that you did not have the opportunity to see something of the city beyond the area
                        we drove through coming in from the airport, because if you had you would not have concluded
                        that this is a hopelessly ugly town. It has its attractive aspects.1
               
                
            The year—1957. The place—
                        Indianapolis
                    , Indiana. Democrat Philip Bayt, Jr., was mayor of the city; the first 
                        Indianapolis
                     500 Festival was held in May with a parade and a formal ball (becoming an 
                        Indianapolis
                     tradition); veteran race car driver Sam Hanks won the forty-first Memorial Day classic
                    (and announced his retirement from automobile racing while sitting in his car in victory lane); and
                    WFMS became the first FM radio station to broadcast from the city.2 Cecil B.
                    DeMille's blockbuster movie The Ten Commandments played at the Lyric Theatre
                    downtown for over six months (reserved seating required); and, like Americans throughout the
                    country, 
                        Indianapolis
                     residents tuned in their television sets to follow the news coverage of the Russian Sputnik satellites or to watch the Milwaukee Braves win the World Series in seven
                    games over the 
                        New York
                     Yankees.3 The first Burger Chef (
                        Indianapolis
                    -based national chain restaurant) opened on the city's west side; both Time and Newsweek cited Shortridge High School as one of America's best;4 and on Saturday, November 2, 1957, the ninety-year-old famed architect Frank
                    Lloyd Wright came to town.

                        Indianapolis
                     skyline had not changed much during the quarter of a century between 1930 and 1957.

                     II programs contributed to the slow improvement of the downtown
                    infrastructure and architecture through the 1940s and 1950s.5 With the
                    completion of the Circle Tower Building (on Monument Circle) in 1930, the only significant structure
                    that had been built in the central city was the "modern" J. C. Penney Building
                    (also on the Circle) in 1950. Thus, architecturally, the 
                        Indianapolis
                     that Wright observed in 1957 was largely a collection of late-nineteenth and
                    first-quarter twentieth-century structures that were no taller than the Soldiers and Sailors
                    Monument (1901) on the Circle or the seventeen-story Merchants National Bank Building (1913) at 
                        Washington
                     and Meridian streets (the city's tallest building until the City-County Building was
                    constructed in 1962).6
            
            Nineteen fifty-seven was a crowded year for Wright. He was involved in forty-three architectural
                    projects, had an extensive travel schedule, and made numerous public appearances. Lectures and
                    television programs (e.g., the Mike Wallace interviews in September and Wright's
                    appearance with Carl Sandburg and host Alistair Cooke on "
                        Chicago
                     Dynamic," WTTW-
                        Chicago
                    , in October) placed him in a number of venues around the country.7
                    Forty-one years later his visit to 
                        Indianapolis
                     in the fall of 1957 merits some notice.
            Cosponsored by the Art Association of 
                        Indianapolis
                     and the Business Furniture Company, Wright was invited to 
                        Indianapolis
                     to lecture on "his recent architecture" at the John Herron Art Museum
                    on Friday, October 18. By mid-October, however, the architect had developed laryngitis and had to
                    cancel; he rescheduled his talk for Saturday, November 2. The 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Star noted that Wright had canceled a television appearance in 
                        New York
                     scheduled for November 3 in order to keep his 
                        Indianapolis
                     commitment.8
            
            On November 2, before his evening lecture at the art museum, Wright was honored with a champagne
                    reception in the Executive Furniture Guild of America showrooms of the Business Furniture Company
                    office in downtown 
                        Indianapolis
                    , where pieces of office furniture designed by Wright and built by Steelcase for the
                    Johnson Wax building were on display. John Ober, then president of the Business Furniture Company,
                    recalled that the reception was a "mad house." Many more people than were invited
                    showed up, making it difficult for Ober to introduce Wright to the guests. Recognizing the
                    situation, Ober ended up placing a chair in the middle of the room on which

                Wright sat and conducted court—in a "sermon on the mount"
                    setting—with many in attendance eventually sitting on the floor around him to listen to

                    initial part of the lecture as John E. Brown, Herron's director of education, recounted in a letter
                    to Wright's secretary, Eugene Masselink: "Naturally, the

                    some of his Wright-isms. In recalling his 1938 visit to the city, the architect observed:
                    "I didn't remember 
                        Indianapolis

                    by J. C. Penney's downtown, which is a little radical. It probably was designed by some out-of-town
                        man."11 (Wright was half right. The Penney's building was designed

                    thought it would be better to tear down the World War Memorial, "a gray mass," and
                    save the two churches at the south corners of the memorial—the Second Presbyterian Church

            As to the future of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Wright waxed prophetic: We've got to devise another way of life, leave the city and
                    live in the country again. Greening is essential to our souls. There is only one course for people
                    to pursue. Decentralization. We must recognize the nature of the thing we are in."14 He continued: "Everything moves faster now. A hundred years long ago
                    is 10 years in today's mode of progress. Can't you see this city going out (to the suburbs)? And
                    when it does, you'd better get out of the way."15
            
            Further documenting Wright's eccentricities, one newspaper reported that during a book signing
                    session the architect refused to sign copies of a bound collection of his work if there were any
                    pages missing.16 And in discussing the status and design for his 
                        Illinois
                     Mile-High Skyscraper project, Wright remarked, "My Mile High building is just
                    simmering now. As long as I don't try to get some one to build it there's no one to say it's no
                        good."17 Yet despite his often curt, off-the-cuff comments about 
                        Indianapolis
                     architecture, it was noted that he thought the Weir Cook Municipal Airport was
                    "very nicely designed."18
            
            Controversial and often misunderstood, Wright evoked differing opinions among local officials,
                    architects, and the news media. Some, like architect Wilbur B. Shook of McGuire and Shook opposed
                    Wright's contention that 
                        Indianapolis
                     would be "on the way out" within the next fifteen years. Shook
                    countered: "downtown 
                        Indianapolis
                     is the heart of our thriving urban and fine supplemental suburban
                    development… the life-giving heart of Monument Circle."19
                    Others found common ground with the master architect's arguments. An 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Star article of November 10, 1957, contained a photograph of a downtown scene with
                    the caption, "Bleak View of Downtown 
                        Indianapolis
                    —Frank Lloyd Wright had a point." And Alfred J. Porteous of
                    Vonnegut, Wright, and Porteous agreed with Wright's comments concerning the World War Memorial:
                    "It's a huge mass of state architecture." Suggesting a constructive approach in
                    dealing with Wright's observations, architect Edward D. Pierce responded,

            A New Document Bearing on the History of George Rogers Clark in

            An unpublished document bearing the signature of Leonard Helm acting under the "Power and
                    Authority given" him by George Rogers Clark has come to light among the manuscript
                    collections of the Old Cathedral Library and Museum in 
                        Vincennes
                    , Indiana.1 The document was found in an unlabeled archival folder
                    in one of several archival document storage boxes that contain the loose leaf manuscripts in the
                    library's collections. It was immediately apparent that the text, in French, was in a different hand
                    than the signature. Clark's name in the initial sentence; the date, "the 1st day of May
                    1779," a mere nine weeks after the surrender of Fort Sackville by British Commander Henry
                    Hamilton to the American cause; and the signature of Helm, Clark's compatriot who had fought with
                    him in Dunmore's War and who had been held prisoner by 
                        Hamilton
                     from December, 1778, to February, 1779, attested to the document's significance.
            The sheet upon which this document was written is a well made, thin cotton rag paper bearing a
                    circular watermark containing what appear to be letters and figures that are not readable and having
                    between eight and nine chain lines per centimeter. The original sheet measured no less than 40
                    centimeters wide and 32.5 centimeters high, but at some point it was folded in half along its height
                    and had the recto of the sheet pasted or glued onto another, central sheet. The fact that Helm used
                    a full sheet, and wrote on only one side, suggests that he had ample paper at his disposal at this
                        time.2 The document follows:

                  1 Manuscripts in the Old Cathedral Library and Museum cover the period
                        from 1740 through the 1900s. While there are a very few that are older still—some
                        brought from Europe date from the very early fourteenth century—most date from the
                        settlement of "St.

            The signer of the document has rightly been called "one of Clark's most valuable captains.
                    He was an interesting, if somewhat rugged character—outspoken, abounding in wit and fun,
                    fearless, even in the presence of danger that would have appalled most brave men, intelligent,
                    level-headed, and absolutely trustworthy. His reputation for courage was unique, even amongst the
                        pioneers."3
            
            Helm was born in Stafford County, 
                        Virginia
                    , the son of Thomas Helm and Margaret Lynaugh (Linaugh, Linah) Helm. His father had
                    arrived in 
                        Virginia
                     as a child with his father and mother and four siblings sometime before May 5, 1720.
                    Nothing is known of the early life of Leonard Helm in Stafford and Prince William counties although
                    his later "letters and records indicate that he had the fair education given to gentlemen's
                    sons who could not be sent back to 
                        England
                    ." The last

                     records that refer to a Leonard Helm are from Loudoun County and show that he bought
                    land there in 1770, but no sale or disposition of it in will or estate is recorded.4 Perhaps Helm left 
                        Virginia
                     shortly after purchasing this land. He is lost to record from

                    remedy that situation. A fellow soldier mentions that Helm went down the Ohio
                    River with Captain Thomas Bullitt "at an early period," and Lyman
                    Draper suggests that this trip perhaps occurred in 1773.5 Helm and Clark were
                    among the men gathered at the Little Kanawha River in the spring of 1774 to undertake a settlement
                    in 
                        Kentucky
                    . Both were involved in Captain Michael Cresap's war against the Shawnees in April of
                    that year.6 Three months later four hundred men led by Major Angus McDonald
                    crossed the 
                        Ohio
                     at Fish Creek and destroyed Indian villages on the Muskingum. Historians generally
                    concur that "there is some reason to believe that Clark, and William Harrod, Leonard Helm
                    and Joseph Bowman… went on this expedition."7 Clark and Helm
                    served in the same division in Dunmore's War during that summer and fall, and Dunmore made Clark
                    "captain of the militia of Pittsburg and its dependencies."8
            
            Clark received his public and secret orders for the 
                        Illinois
                     campaign from Governor Patrick Henry on January 2, 1778. Apparently Helm was one of the
                    first men Clark sought to accompany him, as his diary entry for January 18, 1778, states:
                    "found my old Friend L Helms at Mr Floyds."9 Helm was to
                    recruit a company of men from Fauquier County, 
                        Virginia
                    , and meet Clark at Redstone in 
                        Pennsylvania
                    . By early April Helm marched the few men he could find from interior 
                        Virginia
                     to the Monongahela River and descended the river to the rendezvous point.10 After the bloodless taking of 
                        Kaskaskia
                     and Cahokia, Clark turned his attention to 
                        Vincennes
                    . Aided by Father Pierre Gibault, the inhabitants of 
                        Vincennes
                     took the oath of allegiance on July 20. In his memoir of that campaign Clark wrote of
                    his plan for the occupation of Fort Sackville: "Captn. L. Helms appeared Calculated to
                    answer my purpose he was past the Meridian of life and a good deal acquainted with Indian business I
                    sent him to Comand at that post and also appointed him Agent for Indian affar in the Department of
                    the waubash."11
            
            It was in his capacity as commander at Fort Sackville and agent for Indian affairs that Helm signed
                    the document under consideration. Even though he surrendered his post to Governor Henry Hamilton on
                    December 19, 1778, and was held prisoner in Fort Sackville

                    was not rescinded, and he remained at Fort Sackville after Clark had returned to 
                        Kaskaskia
                    .
            The formal recognition of a militia in 
                        Vincennes
                     was probably among the first things Helm oversaw, and it is in that context that the
                    other two names mentioned in the document—Louis Edeline and Francois
                    Godare—occur.
            Louis Victor Edeline was one of the very early French settlers of Post 
                        Vincennes
                    . He was listed as one of the heads of families settled there on or before August 1,
                    1783, thereby qualifying for a donation of four hundred acres of land in the old Donation tract.12 He was born in Longvevil, Quebec, on December 23, 1730, the son of Louis
                    Antonie Edeline and Madeleine Drousson Edeline. He married Mane Joseph Thomas, a Philadelphian, on
                    May 14, 1759, in 
                        Detroit
                    . They moved to 
                        Vincennes
                     sometime shortly thereafter, probably arriving before 1765. Edeline died on April 28,
                    1799, and is buried in the Old French Cemetery adjacent to St. Francis Xavier church—one
                    of eleven Revolutionary War veterans buried there. His great-great-great-great-granddaughter, Joy
                    Thomas Decker, still resides in 
                        Vincennes
                    .13 As evidenced in the document under consideration, the name
                    "Edeline" has many variant forms. In addition to Louis Deligne one finds reference
                    to L. E. Deline, Lewis Edeline,14 L. E. Doline,15 and Louis
                        Edeligne.16
            
            Shortly after the events to which this document refers, Captain Edeline was appointed one of four
                    judges for the district of 
                        Vincennes
                     by Colonel John Todd, then 
                        Virginia
                    's lieutenant-in charge of the civil affairs of Clark's conquered territory. This
                    "Court for the District of Post 
                        Vincennes
                    " continued in existence until it was superseded by the courts of the 
                        United States
                     set up under the ordinance of 1787.17
            
            Like Edeline, Francois Godere was an early French settler of 
                        Vincennes
                    . He, too, was listed as one of the heads of families who settled there on or before
                    August 1, 1783, thereby qualifying for a donation of four hundred acres of land in the old Donation
                    tract. He was claimant of 400-acre donation #48 in 1783, a tract claimed by Francis Vigo in 1806.18 Godere's marriage to Marie Therese Compagout on

                     January 30, 1774, is recorded in the earliest Old Cathedral
                    Parish records. The Goderes had one son, Antoine.19 Godere was probably
                    illiterate, as he signed an "X" on an 1806 petition to Congress advocating passage
                    of a law extending time for the filing of notices and making proofs of claims to lands.20 Little else is known about Godere other than that he was one of the French
                    villagers (like most of the male population of 
                        Vincennes
                    ) who assisted the Virginians under Clark in retaking Fort Sackville for the American
                    cause. His wife, the "Madame Godere" who sewed the flag flown by Clark above Fort
                    Sackville, is better known. Variant spellings of Godere include Godare,21 and
                        Coder.22
            
            The signature of Charles Vachet, which appears on the back of this document (and many others in the
                    Old Cathedral manuscript collections) in blue pencil, is perhaps the hardest to pin down of all
                    names associated with the Helm document, if only because the name belonged to more than one person
                    in the same family. Ultimately, the specific Vachet who signed the document is less important than
                    the different stories associated with the Vachet family name, stories that provide many different
                    plausible routes by which the document could have come into the Old Cathedral collections.
            Charles Vachet, Jr., whose name appears at the bottom of the abbreviated family tree below,23 is the most likely person to have signed this document and presented it to
                    the Old Cathedral Museum. His great-grandfather, Charles-Francois Vasher, was born in Montreal in
                    1741 but was married in 
                        Vincennes
                     in 1778. He fought on the side of the Virginians in the battle of Fort Sackville and
                    may very well have served in the company of Lt. Godere.24 Another
                    great-grandfather, Jean Baptiste DeElaurier (DeLuyear, Delaurier), was out hunting ducks with
                    Charles-Francois Vasher's father-in-law, Nicholas Cardinal, when the two were captured by Clark's
                    company. They informed Clark that the British were entirely unaware of his coming and guided him to
                    the Sugar Camp and from there to Warriors Knoll.25 Any of these three direct
                    ancestors of Charles Vachet, Jr., could have handed the document down to their great-grandson. But
                    there is one more possibility.

            In a newspaper interview published in 1935, an eighty-five year-old Charles Vachet, Jr., states:
                    "I knew Madame Godare's son, Antoine Godare. He lived on Nicholas between Sixth and
                        Seventh."26 It is just possible, therefore, that this document was
                    given by Antoine Godere to Charles Vachet, Jr. This theory is strengthened by another document in
                    the Old Cathedral manuscript collections bearing the signature of Charles Vachet in blue
                    pencil—a document listing the estate of Francois Godere.
            Finding the unexpected, especially when it is something that informs both national and local history,
                    is always interesting. Early French inhabitants of 
                        Vincennes
                    , such as the Edelines, Goderes, and Vachets, played a very important role in the
                    history of Fort Sackville. Events that loom large in the history of a place are, indeed, affected by
                    very common, "everyday" people.

            "We have surely done a big work": The Diary of a Hoosier Soldier on Sherman's
                    "March to the Sea"
            Edited by Jeffrey L. Patrick and Robert Willey∗
            
            Major General William Tecumseh Sherman's march through 
                        Georgia
                     from 
                        Atlanta
                     to Savannah in the fall of 1864 is a legendary event in the annals of Civil War
                    history. Severing his communication and supply lines to the North, Sherman intended his army to live
                    off the land as an independent force as it aimed for the Atlantic coast. He would thus take the war
                    to the civilian population and destroy the Confederacy's ability to resist. Sherman's relentless
                    drive deep into enemy territory with more than 60,000 men from November 15 to December 21, followed
                    by an equally successful thrust through first 
                        South Carolina
                     and then 
                        North Carolina
                    , contributed greatly to the end of the South's bid for independence. As recent Sherman
                    biographer John F. Marszalek writes,
            
                    Sherman's march to the sea… played a significant role in the Union victory and
                        signaled the future direction of modern warfare. When the Confederacy could not prevent a Union
                        army from moving unimpeded through its heartland, destroying its railroads, taking its food and
                        personal goods, freeing its slaves, terrorizing its people, and shaming its military
                        establishment, its days were numbered.1
               
                
            "Cump" Sherman was already a household name by the time he began his trek to
                    Savannah. In May, 1864, he began perhaps his greatest endeavor, when he moved south and east from 
                        Chattanooga
                     to capture the vital railroad and supply center of 
                        Atlanta
                    . He out-maneuvered his opponent, Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston, drove to the
                    outskirts of the city, and laid siege to the metropolis, by then under the command of General John
                    Bell Hood, Johnston's replacement. On September 1, 1864, after several costly battles, Hood
                    evacuated 
                        Atlanta
                     and withdrew his battered Army of 
                        Tennessee
                    . The victorious Yankees occupied the prized "Gate City" the following

            Hood was not completely finished with Sherman, however. By early October the still lethal Confederate
                    army had moved north of 
                        Atlanta
                    , intending to destroy Sherman's rail line, invade 
                        Tennessee
                     and 
                        Kentucky
                    , and draw the Union forces away from 
                        Georgia
                    . Sherman was forced to send many of his men in pursuit of Hood, all the way to
                    Gaylesville, 
                        Alabama
                    , but there the Federals gave up the chase in late October. Sherman detached two of his
                    army corps to reinforce Federal forces in 
                        Tennessee
                     and deal with any threat by Hood, then returned to 
                        Atlanta
                     to begin the Savannah campaign, popularly known as the "March to the
                        Sea."3 Among Sherman's hard-marching veterans were more than two
                    dozen regiments of Hoosier volunteers, including representatives in the cavalry, infantry, and
                    artillery branches. Although many Indiana units participated in Sherman's campaign, relatively few
                    accounts of the march written by Indiana enlisted men have been published.4
            
            William Blufffon Miller, a Hoosier from 
                        Wells County
                    , kept a record of his experiences on the March to the Sea. Miller served as a sergeant
                    in the Seventy-Fifth Indiana Infantry, a veteran regiment organized in 1862.5 By
                    late 1864 Miller and his unit had seen service during the Tullahoma (Middle 
                        Tennessee
                    ) campaign of 1863, the Battle of Chickamauga, and the 
                        Atlanta
                     Campaign. Although the regiment had also distinguished itself in the assault on
                    Missionary Ridge outside 
                        Chattanooga
                     in November, 1863, Miller—who had been badly wounded in the right and left
                    thighs at Chickamauga—missed this action and did not rejoin his comrades until December
                    of that year. For the purpose of Sherman's great march, the Seventy-Fifth Indiana remained a part of

                    Their corps made up half of the Federal "left wing," also known as the
                    "Army of 
                        Georgia
                    ," which was led by Major General Henry W. Slocum. Two additional Union army
                    corps composed the "right wing."6
            
            On November 15, 1864, in preparation for the march to Savannah, the Indiana units camped east of 
                        Atlanta
                     and that night witnessed a great fire deliberately set by the Federals to destroy
                    businesses and industrial sites. The following morning they started on the epic journey.7
            
            As the regiment left 
                        Atlanta
                    , one member of the Seventy-Fifth noted: "It was a charming November morning.
                    The [Fourteenth] Corps… with swinging, regular step, arms glistening in the sunlight, and
                    colors unfurled to the balmy breezes, was as fine a picture as eyes ever saw." Although all
                    four army corps were marching by separate but parallel routes, their first rendezvous point was in
                    the vicinity of Milledgeville, the capital of 
                        Georgia
                    , and Sherman himself accompanied the "left wing" as far as that
                        city.8
            
            On their way south, the Seventy-Fifth Indiana began the work of making 
                        Georgia
                     "howl." The Hoosiers helped destroy part of the 
                        Georgia
                     Railroad, an activity the regiment performed several times during the campaign, as one
                    eyewitness noted, "On account of its frequent recurrence, it was a work of destruction in
                    which we became proficient, and for which we became famed."9 Foraging
                    parties, soon nicknamed "Sherman's bummers," set out to hunt for rations at local
                    farms and plantations.
            After their arrival at Milledgeville on November 23, the Hoosiers' next objective was the city of
                    Millen, one hundred miles away. In the advance, the troops of the Seventy-Fifth Indiana and the rest
                    of their division were detailed to support Brigadier General Judson Kilpatrick's Union cavalry
                    forces. As it moved, the regiment continued to destroy railroads and forage off the land. Despite
                    skirmishes with rebel cavalry, obstructions of logs and felled trees, annoying rain, and scarce
                    forage, the Hoosiers moved beyond Millen in early December and closed in around Savannah.
            Because Sherman was reluctant to order a direct assault on the city, the Seventy-Fifth settled in
                    beyond the rebel fortifications to await their commander's next move. Although the veteran regiment
                    enjoyed abundant but monotonous rations of rice around Savannah, the men were soon sent out to
                    forage for better fare and were successful

                    However, on December 20, the very day that the Seventy-Fifth rejoined the army, the rebels withdrew
                    from the city, and the Federals occupied it the next day. After being reviewed by Sherman, the
                    soldiers rested until January 19, 1865, when the army was ordered to begin the march northward
                    through 
                        South Carolina
                    .
            Although the March to the Sea had been a relatively easy trek for Miller's regiment, the effective
                    and well-conducted campaign was a source of great pride for the Union veterans. Encountering little
                    enemy opposition, they had scarcely fired a round of ammunition, except at pigs and chickens. They
                    had marched leisurely, traveled more than three hundred miles, lived off the land, and accomplished
                    their mission of devastation across 
                        Georgia
                    , thus proving the impotence of the Confederacy in the region. Major General Absalom
                    Baird summarized a few of his division's achievements during the march as he rested in Savannah:
            
                    The amount of sweet potatoes, hogs, cattle, and poultry taken in the country and consumed by the
                        troops cannot be estimated, but it must have been very large, the men living well.
                    The division destroyed quite effectually eighteen miles of railroad and two large
                        bridges…. It destroyed, I feel quite sure, 1,000 bales of cotton….
                    The amount of forage and other minor articles consumed and destroyed cannot be estimated. The
                        command foraged liberally. The number of drafted and saddle animals captured was about
                        597….
                    Negroes to the number of about 668 joined or followed our column on the march….10
               
                
            Despite the claims of many southerners and even some northerners, Sherman's army should not shoulder
                    the entire blame for the destruction in 
                        Georgia
                    . It is clear that Union deserters, slaves, civilians, and Confederate deserters and
                    cavalry units played a part in the looting and pillaging as well. It must also be pointed out that
                    even though a large amount of personal property was stolen or destroyed by the Federals, few
                    civilians were physically harmed, and their homes were generally left intact. In a sense, Georgians
                    were spared the worst of the devastation, for the residents of 
                        South Carolina
                     suffered far greater losses following Sherman's departure from Savannah, in part
                    because his men reserved much of their vengeance for the state in which the secession movement had
                    begun four years earlier.11

            William Bluffton Miller maintained a detailed diary throughout his service, not only noting mundane
                    matters such as personal health and weather conditions but also chronicling the experiences of a
                    Union infantryman in some of the most famous campaigns of the Civil War. Miller's diary also
                    includes other valuable details: his encounters with the men of his regiment and with southern
                    civilians, his concern for his family, his experiences in combat, and his day-to-day struggle for
                    survival in an infantry regiment on active service. Among other things, Miller's journal helps
                    document the treatment of southern property, the destruction of railroads and industries, and the
                    other crucial activities of a "typical" Union regiment during the march through 
                        Georgia
                    . Miller's entries covering the March to the Sea and the Savannah Campaign follow in
                    their entirety, beginning with the night before his departure from 
                        Atlanta
                    .
            
                    
                  
                     
                        Tuesday Nov 15th [1864]12
                        
                        Moved out at daylight and arrived at 
                                        Atlanta
                                     about nine Oclock A M. We stopped in the city untill afternoon and then
                                    moved out on the Augusta Rail Road and camped on an elevation that overlooks the
                                    city. The city is fired in severel places and about dark the Torch was set into the
                                    Buisiness part. It was a grand sight from our camp to look down on the burning city.
                                    The night is dark and an occasional shell bursts and scatters things around
                                    promiscuously. Some of our Boys was down and got some clotheing from the burning
                                    buildings. The entire city was distroyed but a few accupied houses. It reminds me of
                                    the distruction of the city of Babolon as spoken of in the Bible whis was distroyed
                                    because of the wickedness of her people and that is the case with 
                                        Atlanta
                                    . I feel Sorry for some of the people but a Soldier is not supposed to
                                    have any concience and must lay aside all scruples he may have. We drew some
                                    clotheing and Rations and have orders to move in the morning. With all the
                                    excitement and attending to duty I did not get any Sleep.
                        Wednesday Nov 16th
                        We Struck tents and formed Battallion on Collor Line and Genl Sherma[n]s order was
                                    read to us. He says it has become necissary to change our base of opporation and
                                    that we will be required to march only fifteen miles a day unless circumstances
                                    should require more. 
                              
                                 12 William Bluffton Miller probably kept his journal
                                            in small pocket diaries that were easily carried during the war, then later
                                            copied them into the approximately 71/2 × 91/2 volume that
                                            remains today. The following portion of his account conforms as nearly as
                                            possible to this larger journal. Miller's punctuation and spelling have been
                                            retained, with occasional bracketed insertions to clarify meaning. Double
                                            spaces designate sentence breaks in places where Miller failed to use end
                                            punctuation. Capitalization often required arbitrary decisions, particularly
                                            with the letters s, w, m, y, and c.

                                    to forage and then in partys large enough to protect our selves from Bushwhackers as
                                    they will follow us all the time. We left

                                     about nine Oclock A M and followed the Augusta Rail Road and passed
                                    through Decature and marched about fifteen miles. A Boy in Co E by name of Shull
                                    died to night Suddenly.13 No one knew he was sick untill he was
                                    discovered dead. The country we passed to day is good some hilly but the Plantations
                                    in good shape.
                        Thursday Nov 17th
                        On the road early. Passed a small town called La Toona on the Rail Road. We put in
                                    part of the day tearing up the Rail Road. We marched fifteen miles and camped near
                                    Conyers Station. We find plenty of forage and live entirely off the country. Some of
                                    the old citizens complain teribly and claim to be Union men and have never been any
                                    thing els. Our Boys tell them if they are Union men they can afford to contribute
                                    some thing to help us cary on the war and if they are Rebels we will take it any
                                    way. In that way we manage to live. But if we was not here they would be all Rebels.
                                    They are loyal by compulsion only.
                        Friday Nov 18th
                        We pulled out early and marched hard. We tore up some more Rail Road. We passed near 
                                        Oxford
                                     and through 
                                        Covington
                                     both nice towns. Some Bush Whackers attacted our foragers and wounded
                                    severel and Among them Capt Wilcox of the 105

                                    will not be good for us to fall into their hands. They swear vengence on us for
                                    marching through their country but they have only got a taste to what they will get
                                    before we get through. We marched the usual fifteen miles and camped near Yellow
                                    River. This part of the country has never seen any Yankees only prisoners and the
                                    armies have not molested it and the citizens are well fixed and have plenty which
                                    makes it nice for us in levying contributions on them. We live like fighting cocks.

                        We was hurried out in the rain at daylight and the road was slipry which made it hard
                                    marching. We turned off the Rail Road to the right and went to Sand Town which we
                                    passed about dusk. We found plenty of forage such as Yams and Sweet Potatoes And
                                    Sorgum Molasses by the barrel. We could not use all that was brought in and it was
                                    distroyed. Some Bushwhackers hung on our flanks but kept at a safe distance. We
                                    camped after dark and had plenty of wood but water was scarce. It is raining some.
                                    We are on the Road direct to the capitol Milledgeville. The Rebels reported in force

                                        Jonesboro
                                     and ready for fight. But I dont think they have men enough to make a
                                    Breakfast Spell in this country. The country is generally level and Soil Sandy and
                                    the plantations under a good State of cultivation
                        Sunday Nov 20th
                        We made the usual march of fifteen miles and nothing worthy of note transpired. The
                                    country is good and we found it well waterd. The principle products are Yams, Sweet
                                    Potatoes Some corn and Pea Nutts. We dont find many men at home. They are either in
                                    the Rebel Armies or are called away about the time they learn we are comeing.
                        Monday Nov 21st
                        It rained all day and the roads are terible. We only marched about ten miles. We left
                                    Eatonton to our left. The soil here is mixed with Red clay and Icenglass and it is
                                    Slipery and sticks to the feet. It is hard on the teams and the mules travel very
                                    slow and the wagons did [dig?] up the roads makes work for the Pioneers and Darkies
                                    who are pressed into the service.15 We are still going towards
                                    Millidgeville. Forage plenty. Some of the citizens say the Johnies are waiting for
                                    us there and that we will get a whipping.16 Let them trot out
                                    their men.
                        Tuesday Nov 22nd
                        We started at daylight. It was quite cold but no rain. We Soon struck good roads and
                                    marched about fifteen miles and camped on Ex Gov Cobbs plantation.17 He is now in command of 
                                        Georgia

                                            units to clear roads, erect bridges, and perform other similar duties.

                                     Militia. We are eight miles from Millidgeville.
                                    We found plenty of Hogs, Corn & Yams and supposed Gov Cobb would not want us
                                    to pass by his plantation when he had plenty without asking him to contribute
                                    something for the Union We concluded to stay all night and as he
                                    was not at home we just helped ourselves to such as we found. It appears he had very
                                    urgent buisiness away from home when he heard we was comeing to see him. Pherhaps he
                                    thought we might want him to go along with us. But it is all right and we will
                                    excuse him. We was in the lead and camped about three Oclock P.M. Our troops have
                                    possession of the city and the Johnies have skipped out. Our quarters are full of
                                    all kinds of forage to night and we are happy. The wind blows hard and it is cold
                                    for this part of the country.
                        Wednesday Nov 23rd
                        All the principle Buildings was burned on the plantation to let the Ex Gov know we
                                    had been here and that it might be impressed on his mind so he would not forget it.
                                    Our quarters are coverd with Yams and they are frozen hard. The Darkies Say it was
                                    an unusually cold night. This has been a pretty place and when we arrived here last
                                    night was in a good shape but this morning we leave it stripped of its beauty and we
                                    start to Millidgeville. We camped in the edge of the city. It is a nice place. The
                                    Rebel Legislature was in Session but they adjourned as they had some other important
                                    buisiness on hand when the[y] heard Sherman was comeing. I was in the sennate
                                    chamber and our Boys held a Mock Legislature personating the Johnies and it was very
                                    amuseing to hear them. They kept it up nearly all the afternoon. They carried it on
                                    in regular Southern fire eating stile and was all armed with large knives captured
                                    from the Arsnell which is Situated in the same encloseure. The Arsnel contained Some
                                    Small arms and about four thousand Pikes and cutlasses for cutting up Yankees and
                                    now we are here for the sacrifice and the Butchers are not at home. The State papers
                                    was about all removed to Macon by the Rebels. The Arsnell was blown up to night and
                                    the state Prison was burned by the Rebels and all the prisoners liberated if they
                                    would join the Army. The men as usual are not at home and a great many citizens left
                                    the city. I noticed some fine buildings but the State House looks old and rusty. I
                                    was through the State prison building and it is badly damaged. I got one of the
                                    cutlasses and will endevour to cary it home as a curiosity. This was a cold frosty
                                    day. The 20th Army Corps has the advance and the[y] moved on to night and we are to
                                    follow in the morning. It is reported that our men had a fight at Macon to day but
                                    nothing reliable.
                        Thursday Nov 24th
                        Unexpectedly we got no orders to move this morning. The weather is nice but still
                                    cool. Nice weather for marching. I visited the city again but there was nothing new
                                    to see. Killpatricks Cavalry moved

                                     through the city. Our division will opperate on
                                    the left in conjunction with Killpatrick. We have a nice camping ground and good
                                    water and plenty of Rails.
                        Friday Nov 25th
                        We started from Millidgeville early this morning and marched about Eighteen miles and
                                    got into camp after night. We got into some swampy country and had bad roads. They
                                    differ from the swamp in Indiana in this that they are quick Sand and are miery and
                                    some times they are miles wide. The citizens say the farther we get south the more
                                    swamps. Our camp is about three miles from buffalo Creek.
                        Saturday Nov 26th
                        We took the advance this morning of the Division and we had the first skirmishing to
                                    day since we left 
                                        Atlanta
                                    . This evening before we camped we had to drive the Rebel Cavalry away.
                                    We had one man killed and one wounded and found one dead Johnie and captured one. It
                                    did not last long. We drove them through a small town called Sandersonville. The
                                    Rebels said to be in force two miles ahead but they will be gone when we get there.
                                    We crossed severel Swamps and camped about three Oclock P.M
                        Sunday Nov 27th
                        We started at daylight in advance and did not find any of the Johnies where they was
                                    reported. We marched twenty miles and camped about dusk. We passed a plantation
                                    where a Cotton Gin was burning and a large amount of cotton was distroyed. We also
                                    found a Store House of wines and some of our Boys got gloriously drunk. They was run
                                    out here from Savannah when the Rebels thought the Yankees was comeing up the river.
                                    The proprietor was not at home haveing important buisiness to attend to when he
                                    heard Sherman would visit him. But it made no material difference as we helped
                                    ourselves as usual and made ourselves perfectly at home. The country is generally
                                    level and the soil Sandy and well waterd.
                        Monday Nov 28th
                        We have the advance again to day and started at day light and marched six miles to
                                    Blackrock Creek where we found the Bridge burned which detained us untill nearly
                                    night before we got it Bridged so as to cross. We then moved on a Short distance to 
                                        Louisville
                                     which we found on fire. The report is a woman spit in a Yankees face
                                    and called him names and he set the house on fire and it burned several others and
                                    the Regiment was orderd to put out the fire and protect the town against any further
                                    damage. This is a county Seat of Jefferson county. My company quarterd in the court
                                    House. The town had about one thousand inhabitants but the men are all gone and no
                                    body here but women and children except very old men. The country  about here is level and some good farms. Rebels
                                    reported at Augusta in force. We find it hard marching in the Sand as it gives under
                                    our feet like Snow. Our men are scatterd over town as provost guards to protect the
                                    property. This is our last day in advance as we only have it three days in
                                    Succession.
                        Tuesday Nov 29th
                        The 20th Corps takes the advance and moved through town but we did not move. We done
                                    provost duty. Genl Davis Sent to Capt Karns for a Guard and I reported to him with
                                    two men and I was orderd to arrest a Boy from the 20th Corps who had tried the Smoke
                                    house at His Head quarters.18 The Genl orderd me to take him to
                                    our quarters and tie him up and then go and get his Lieutenant at a Blacksmith Shop
                                    and bring him to him. I done as orderd and Davis gave the Lieut a terible curseing
                                    and then orderd me to release them which I did. Genl Davis is a good reliable
                                    Officer but very passionate and I concluded when I heard him talking to that Lieut
                                    that it might do for him to curse some men that way and I might have kept still if
                                    it had been my case but he has no right to abuse a man simply because he out ranks
                                    him and I think I should have cautioned him not to repeat it. I think every man
                                    should show due respect for his officers but when the General or any officer
                                    descends from his rank to curse and abuse the man below him he is not entitled to
                                    any respect. Genl Davis took the life of Nelson at 
                                        Louisville
                                     for the same offense.19 We was relieved from duty
                                    by Co H. at dark. Our foragers had some Skirmishing with the Rebs and they also
                                    attacted Trains of the 20th A.C near Blackrock Creek Bridge but was repulsed.
                                    Severel of our men was wounded. They undertook to capture the Train but found more
                                    Yankees than they expected. We also have a report that Genl Killpatrick was beaten
                                    near Millan but no particulars.20

                        No orders to move to day yet. There was some Skirmishing with Bushwhackers and our
                                    forageing parties. I was down to town but could find nothing amuseing or instructive
                                    and re[t]urned to camp.

                                            Indiana in August, 1862, and served until mustered out in June, 1865.

                                            wounded unarmed Major General William Nelson after an argument in a hotel in

                                            1862. Nelson, Davis's commanding officer, had earlier rebuked his
                                            subordinate. Davis was never tried for the offense. Faust, Historical Times Illustrated Encyclopedia, 207-208; Boatner, Civil War Dictionary, 226.

                                            Division fought a severe skirmish with Major General Joseph Wheeler's

                                            . Kilpatrick's men were forced to withdraw. This is probably the
                                            action referred to by Miller. Official Records, ser. I,
                                            vol. XLIV, pp. 55, 363-64, 408-409.
                           
                                     Nothing confirming the defeat of our Cavalry
                                    near Millan. We still have plenty of forage.
                        Thursday Dec 1st
                        We left town about nine Oclock and Joined the Brigade and camped for the night. The
                                    Cavalry and foragers done some Skirmishing and we formed a line of Battle and moved
                                    out about one mile but the Johnies Skipped out when they saw the old "flat
                                    foots["] comeing. Severel Cavalry was killed and wounded but we did not
                                    become engaged. I got hold of a Rebel paper to day and it is very amuseing to read
                                    their accounts of us. One item said Shermans men was Hungry and ragged and deserting
                                    by hundreds and he might possibly get out with" a corporals Guard (two men)
                                    they would capture nearly his entire Army. They will have quite a number to gobble
                                    yet before they get us all. Our men are in the best of spirits and have plenty to
                                    eat and wear and think it fun. I learned to day that we left Kingston with ten days
                                    rations on the wagon and we have not drawn any since. So we are ten days ahead
                                        yet.21 According to their papers we have been defeated
                                    severel times since we started. But I suppose the Democratic papers in the north
                                    will be glad to publish that kind of news and that will make our friends worry about
                                    us. But I will Say if the Johnies capture Sherman and his men they will want help to
                                    let us go. I dont believe one man has deserted on this march and I doubt if any
                                    does. The Rebel cavalry harrassing us only keeps our men together and they dont do
                                    us any harm and if they are not carefull they may get a warming up befor we reach
                                    our destination
                        Friday Dec 2nd
                        We got marching orders and was on the road early and only marched ten miles. Wheeler
                                    and Hamptons Rebel Cavalry are keeping on our flanks.22 We left
                                    Waynesboro to our left and they are reported to have a large force of Cavalry there.
                                    They are reported at so many places but when we go to them they are looking for us
                                    some place els. The[y] dont wait untill we come. But then it is safer for them.
                        Saturday Dec 3rd
                        We took the wrong road and marched twelve miles and was then only five miles from
                                    where we camped last night. We Struck 
                              
                                 21 Miller refers to the town of Kingston, which the
                                            Seventy Fifth passed through on October 11, 1864, on their way back to

                                 22 Miller was mistaken regarding the role of Major
                                            General Wade Hampton. At this time Hampton was commanding the cavalry corps

                                            cavalry corps of the Department of

                                    miles from Millan prison pen.23 We tore up the track. Burned the
                                    Ties and crooked the Iron and camped along the Road. The Rebel Cavalry have been
                                    harrassing us all day and they have to many for Killpatrick alone and we help him
                                    out when he gets into a bad scrape. They are near us to night.
                        Sunday Dec 4th
                        The Rebs run up a Howitzer and Shelled the 92nd 
                                        Illinois
                                     and stampeeded a Cavalry Regiment before day light and we got into line
                                    quick. Genl Killpatrick formed and drove them off and followed towards Waynesboro
                                    where the[y] surroundid his command and they built a Barracade of Rails and we was
                                    orderd to support him. When we arrived they were haveing a lively time. We formed
                                    and E & K companies was thrown out as Skirmishers and they did not find out
                                    we was Infantry untill they discoverd our flag. We opend up on them they concluded
                                    they did not want Killpatrick. They had to retreat across a large swamp about a mile
                                    wide and the road was graded high and about wide enough for three or four men to
                                    ride abreast they was in such a hurry the[y] crouded each other off. Some of them
                                    undertook to ride through the Swamp and they mired down and was shot off their
                                    horses and quite a number lay along the road. We pushed on after our Cavalry into
                                    town and followed them some distance but they did not hault any more untill they put
                                    the river between them and us. We then returned to town. Gatherd up the guns and
                                    wounded left the dead to be burried by the citizens and started to catch up with the
                                    ballance of the Army. We did not get to camp untill after midnight and march[ed]
                                    over twenty miles. We camp at 
                                        Alexandria
                                    . We run Wheeler away from his breakfast and came very near captureing
                                    him and his Staff. They was completely surprised at infantry getting there so soon
                                    and supposed we was at Millan. Our loss was about forty men altogether. We captured
                                    about a hundred prisoners and killed about thirty of them. It was fun for us to see
                                    them Skip out. I seen one old Reb lying along the road (quite an old man) that had
                                    been a Saber stroke across his back and was not dead yet but mortally wounded and
                                    under other circumstances his grey hairs would have appealed to my heart for
                                    simpathy but we are not here to Simpathise with men who brought it on themselves.
                                    When we skirmished through the town we did not see any body but Rebel Cavalry but
                                    when we returned it was alive with women and children who had on their sunday
                                    clothes and it reminded me of home. They had hid in the cellars while the fight was
                                    going on and come out to see us.24

                              24 A few days after Kilpatrick retreated from Wheeler near
                                        Waynesboro, Sherman ordered him to make a strong reconnaissance back toward that
                                        town and to
                        
                        
                        Monday Dec 5th
                        We was on the march early and marched twenty miles and camped near Jacksonboro. We
                                    had no Skirmishing to day as I guess they had all they wanted yesterday and will let
                                    us alone. This part of 
                                        Georgia
                                     is very poor. The Soil is very Sandy and the timber mostly pine. I
                                    would not take the best plantation here as a gift and live on it. The citizens as a
                                    general thing have no education and are to lazy or careless to work and have always
                                    depended on the Darkis to support them.
                        Tuesday Dec 6th
                        We had the lead to day and marched twenty miles. The Rebel cavalry put in an
                                    appearance again to day and kept popping away at us when ever they got a chance but
                                    they did not bother us much. I got a rebel paper and it is full of good news for
                                    them. It says Wheelers Cavalry cleaned out the 14th Corps and Killpatricks Cavalry
                                    Sunday at Waynesboro. If we had not been there I could believe it better. But if
                                    that is what they call a victory we will give them one every day. It also says
                                    Sherman is trying to get to Savannah and I am thankfull for the information as I did
                                    not know before where we are going. I noticed a Small item where the Tellegraph
                                    Opperator tellegraphed to 
                                        Richmond
                                     from Millan Saying Sherman was within two miles of that place and he
                                    (The opperator) was about to bid it a hasty adiew and said they had not heard from
                                    him Since and the Editor supposed Sherman had Millan.
                        Wednesday Dec 7th
                        We marched twenty miles to day and camped and got our suppers when we received
                                    marching orders and started again about ten Oclock and moved five miles. The Cavalry
                                    coverd the rear and as they enterd a swamp charged them but our boys held their
                                    ground. The Rebels thought they would stampeed the Cavalry and play the same game we
                                    played on them at Waynesboro but they failed. We stopped about four Oclock A M and
                                    got a little rest but we needed it badly as we marched about twenty five miles Since
                                    Yesterday morning. It rained some during the night.
                        
                           engage Wheeler's cavalry wherever they were encountered. On December 4
                                        Kilpatrick gained his revenge when his troopers met a rebel skirmish line near
                                        town and drove them back upon their main line, which consisted of dismounted
                                        cavalry posted behind barricades. After a failed first charge, the Yankees
                                        carried them with a second assault and drove Wheeler's men into Waynesboro. In
                                        town Kilpatrick discovered a second line of barricades, which he also carried by
                                        direct assault, and routed the rebels. Baird's Third Division, including the
                                        Seventy-Fifth Indiana, supported Kilpatrick. Official Records,

                        Thursday Dec 8th
                        Our Brigade had to take the rear and did not leave camp untill about Nine Oclock A.M.
                                    We had marched about Six miles when we haulted for dinner and the Rebels made a dash
                                    at us and we formed a line of Battle and moved out to meet them but they only came
                                    to our Picket line. There was a number of Shots fired and some men hurt. Some of our
                                    Boys was out in front of the picket line gathering pine knots for fire when the
                                    Rebels [came] and we thought they were our own Cavalry. Among them was Capt Peter
                                    Studabaker of the 101st Indiana and when the charge was sounded he discoverd they
                                    were Johnies and he retreated on a "double quick inside our lines.25 He had severel pine knots in his arms but he left them for
                                    the "Johnies." I dont Say the Captain was scared but he done some
                                    pretty [keen?] running to get away. We lay in line untill midnight but they did not
                                    molest us any further and we then crossed Big Ebonezer River and the 75th coverd the
                                    rear and had orders to burn the Bridge which we did at day light. This stream runs
                                    through a swamp about three miles wide and the road is graded hight. It [Up?] to
                                    this time the Darkies have been following the army from sections through which we
                                    passed and have accumulated to thousands of all Sizes and Sex and our orders is not
                                    let them cross the River. The Rebels shelled us some as we was leaveing but only
                                    wounded one man. Some say the shell came from a Gun Boat. There has been some heavy
                                    cannon-adeing to day along our lines.
                        Friday Dec 9th
                        When we destroyed the Bridge across Big Ebonezer this morning the road as far as we
                                    could see north was lined with negroes who have followed us. It was really pitty
                                    full to see them and they are afraid of the Rebels and begged hard to get over. Some
                                    of them Swam the river but the women and children could not get over. I noticed
                                    women with two or three little children trudgeing along through the mud. Old white
                                    headed men who could hardly walk all trying to get away. They are very ignorant but
                                    they know on[e] thing and that is they want to be free. Thinking they could go with
                                    us they have gathered up their little effects and left their old homes. They are
                                    taught to believe that we were regular cut throats by their masters but when we come
                                    they are ready to go with us. They know we are their friends and the mistery is how
                                    they know it. Some of them say they thought the Yankees had horns like an ox. I dont
                                    see how they can live in the 
                              
                                 25 Peter Studabaker, a farmer from Bluffton, Indiana,
                                            began the war as captain of Company B, 101st Indiana Volunteer Infantry, in
                                            August, 1862, but was promoted to major of the regiment in June, 1863. He
                                            survived the war and was mustered out with his regiment in June, 1865. Peter

                                    distroyed. Some Negro Huts are left but Smoke marked the advance of our Army and
                                    many of Shermans Monuments (as we call the chimneys) are standing in memory of the
                                    "March to the Sea." There was heavy cannon-adeing to day and one
                                    place at the entrance to a Swamp the Johnies planted a Battery so as to rake the
                                    road and dismounted one of our Guns but it got to hot for them and they pulled out.
                                    They killed a Lieutenant of one of our Batteries but I did not learn his name. We
                                    had to go some out of our way on account of our Wagon train and only moved about ten
                                    miles. Things look now like we should get through with a very Small loss and showes
                                    the Johnies did not make good their boasting of Captureing Sherman and his Army.
                        Saturday Dec 10th
                        We did not leave camp untill about ten Oclock Am as we are still in the rear. The
                                    first Division drove the Rebels out of a small Fort and captured one gun. We struck
                                    the Charles ton an[d] Savannah Rail Road about Eleven miles from the latter and near
                                    where it crosses the Savannah River. We tore up the Track and there is a long
                                    Trustle work through the Swamp leading to the Bridge and a detail was sent to fire
                                    it and the Bridge but the Rebs had a Gun Boat laying in the river and they Shelled
                                    us so we abandoned it. They made it "redd hot" for us. We camped
                                    for the night here and it rained very hard nearly all night. The Soil is yellow sand
                                    and the product of the country is principally Rice.
                        Sunday Dec 11th
                        The cannonadeing is heavy this morning in the direction of Savannah. It cleared away
                                    and we made another attempt to distroy the Trustleing and Bridge but the Swamp and
                                    Rebels prevented us. We moved about two miles across a Swamp and obstructed the road
                                    by cutting timber in. The Johnies made their appearance but did not attact us. It is
                                    reported that our fleet is lying at Fort Jackson below the city and will opporate in
                                    conjunction with us.26 Wheeler made a dash on our pickets but he
                                    did not remain long.
                        
                           
                              26 Miller was correct in that Union naval forces were near
                                        Sherman's army, although some distance from Fort Jackson. On December 13 Rear
                                        Admiral John A. Dahlgren of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron sent word to
                                        Sherman that he had two ironclad ships at Wassaw Sound and a force of gunboats
                                        at Ossabaw Sound and the Savannah River, east and southeast of the city.
                                        Dahlgren believed that the best way to open communications with the army was
                                        from Ossabaw Sound into the Great Ogeechee River. Unfortunately for the
                                        Federals, the river was guarded several miles upstream by Confederate-held Fort
                                        McAllister, although Dahlgren thought the fort could be successfully assaulted

                        Monday Dec 12th
                        We did not move to day. There was some Cannonadeing. The 20th Army Corps captured a
                                    Boat comeing down the river loaded with provission from Augusta. Our rations are
                                    getting Short and we dont get any hard Tack.27 Nothing but
                                    Coffee, Beef & Rice and we have been liveing so well that it goes hard with
                                    us. Wheeler did not put in appearence to day as he cannot cross the Swamp untill he
                                    cuts out the timber and we have a Battery Stationed to rake it and it would be very
                                    hazzarous. The weather is warm and I find one nice thing for us. That is no amount
                                    of rain can produce any mud. The sand when wet packs down solid and the water runs
                                    away.
                        Tuesday Dec 13th
                        We moved about Eight Oclock to the crossing of the Macon and Savannah Rail Road and
                                    took a position in rear of our wagon train as we front all around. We have Rebels in
                                    Savannah and Rebel behind us and dont know where they may attact us first. Their was
                                    some heavy fighting on our right and it is reported that our men captured a Gun Boat
                                    in the river and that the Rebels are evacuating the city via the Gulf Rail Road and
                                    I think our lines must extend nearly all around the city on the north and south. We
                                    drew one quarter rations of hard Bread. But we have plenty of rice and we have to
                                    hull it in a tin cup with our Bayonett. It makes Rough feed as the Boys say but it
                                    does very well.
                        Wednesday Dec 14th
                        We remained in camp all day and the cannonadeing was kept up as usual but seams to be
                                    down the river from us and I suppose it is our fleet Shelling the city. We got the
                                    news of the capture of Fort McAllister on the Ogechee river and that we could now
                                    write our friends as that opend communication. I did not learn what our loss was but
                                    our men charged the fort from the land side carying it by storm captureing the
                                    entire Garrison28 this makes the thirty second day Since we left
                                    Kingston and Seventy one since we started north from 
                                        Atlanta
                                     since which we have been moveing continuously and we have surely done a
                                    big work. We have cut the Confederacy in twain and destroyed the crops in the
                                    richest part of their country so 
                              
                                 27 Miller refers to the army bread ration, known
                                            officially as "hardtack" or "hard
                                            bread." The large, hard crackers were a staple of the army diet,
                                            with nine or ten issued daily. Detailed information on hardtack can be found

                                            of Savannah on the Great Ogeechee River, was the key to the city's defenses

                        Thursday Dec 15th
                        I wrote a Letter to Nett to let her know that I am Still among the liveing and how
                                    many hearts will be made glad when our Letters get home to our friends many miles
                                    from us and who have looked anxiously for one word from us from day to day during
                                    our long march and how they will rejoice when the[y] know the victory gained over
                                    Treason and the prospect of a speedy close of the war.29 I am
                                    satisfied that unless the war closes we will make more such Raids through their
                                    country and devastate their land entirely. They will begin to see that the Yankees
                                    are getting in earnest. Savannah must surrender soon and then we will make that a
                                    base of opporation. We got orders to go forageing to morrow morning. There was some
                                    Skirmishing to day. We did not get any mail.
                        Friday Dec 16th
                        Our entire Brigade started South west from camp for the purpose of forageing. We
                                    passed the prisoners captured at Fort McCallister and they are the worst looking
                                    Soldiers I ever Seen. They are little Boys and very old men not strong enough to be
                                    in the field. They were about played out marching. We took a good laugh at one of
                                    our men who was guarding a Boy quite small and they was behind the rest and the
                                    little fellow was about played [out] and one of our Boys suggested to the guard as
                                    we passed that if he could find a cow to let that Babe Suck. It
                                    sounded rediculous and caused considerable merriment. I see by these prisoners how
                                    the Rebels are pushed for Soldiers and convinces me that the war is nearly over. We
                                    marched about Twenty five miles and crossed the Ogechee river about dark and camped
                                    two miles from the river. Our rout was through a Swampy country and the land is
                                    mostly coverd with water. I started from Camp with four small crackers and a little
                                    Coffee and we found nothing but Rice on the march and I had to go to bed hungry to
                                    night but misery likes company and I console Myself by thinking that no body els has
                                    any more than I have. There was a Mail Boat lying at the Wharf when we crossed the
                                    river. We did not see any Johnies. I am very tired and sore from marching.
                        Saturday Dec 17th
                        We started at day light and soon passed a long wagon train loaded with corn and they
                                    told us we would find plenty of forage. I 
                              
                                 29 Nett was Miller's wife, Melissa Jeannette Karns,
                                            whom he married on June 14, 1860, in Bluffton. William B. Miller file in

                                     had one little cracker and some Rice for
                                    breakfast. We passed a plantation in the evening where some Soldiers was cooking
                                    Sweet Potatoes and we inquired how far we would have to go before we would find
                                    forage and an old Darky said three miles and I almost felt as though I could never
                                    march it. But I did and we found plenty. This plantation belongs to an old Rebel by
                                    the name of Collins. I Shot a hog as the Regiment camped and Skind out a ham and
                                    Lieut Starbuck had some Yams and we got a square meal and we done it Justice.30 I thought I was hollow clear to my toes. We loaded our wagons
                                    with corn during the night so as to return in the morning. We loade[d] Ninety one
                                    Wagons. We did not see any Johnies but they are reported to be at Rice ville a Short
                                    distance away. Some claim we are in the State of 
                                        Florida
                                    . We marched twenty four miles to day.
                        Sunday Dec 18th
                        My Regiment with the 105th 
                                        Ohio
                                     was Sent towards Riceville to see what was there in the Shape of
                                    Johnies. We went within about two miles of the Town and as they was gone we returned
                                    to the Train and we started back towards camp and marched ten miles and correlled
                                    the Train and camped for the night. We passed Station No 3 where we found about one
                                    hundred and fifty Barrells of Salt but the station house was burned. This is a
                                    terible country. It seams to be one continued Swamp and the country coverd with
                                    water. They dont raise any thing but rice and alligators and there is plenty [of]
                                    boath. Our old Darky Andy is very fraid of the latter and I put up a little Job on
                                    him. When he went to the Swamp for wood about dark I followed and about the time he
                                    Shoulderd the wood I made a Splash in the water and he supposed it was an Allegator
                                    and dropped his wood and retreated in quick time to camp. The old fellow had a
                                    terible tale to relate when I came back about seeing an Allegator and how it tried
                                    to catch him and how he out run it. I tried to persuade him to go back but he would
                                    not go and I had to go and get wood myself and I dont know whether the joke is on
                                    him or me.
                        Monday Dec 19th
                        We started again at day light re-crossed the Ogechee and Stopped for the night near
                                    the 17th Corps. They say we will have to take another road than the one we come from
                                    here to camp. There was nothing unusual occured to day only we marched about twenty
                                    five miles. We heard some cannonadeing along the lines but no fighting of any
                                    consequence.
                        
                           
                              30 First Lieutenant James A. Starbuck of Bluffton was
                                        commissioned and mustered into Company K of the Seventy-Fifth Indiana in August,
                                        1862, and served in that capacity until he was mustered out in June, 1865. From
                                        1861 to 1862 Starbuck had served as a private in Company G, Twelfth Indiana
                                        Infantry, a one-year regiment. He died near Pennville, Indiana, in June, 1914.

                        Tuesday Dec 20th
                        Started at day light and got on the wrong road and went a few miles out of our way.
                                    One place we had to pass within range of a Rebel Battery. The road was graded up and
                                    there is water on boath sides of it. It looked like a lake and the[y] have been
                                    shelling this part of the road and knocked Severel wagons off but our officers
                                    concluded rather than go around they would cross here. We was deployed at five paces
                                    and Started through and the Johnies opend up on us and the Shells would come
                                    skipping along on the surface of the water and strike in the road or pass over us.
                                    Our wagons was deployd and they pepered away at them but did not hurt a man or
                                    damage any of the wagons but all passed over safe and we went on to camp where I
                                    found four letters from Nett and one from Mollie with some Towells and a
                                        Handkerchief.31 The Letters was dated Nov 8th, 12th, 14th
                                    & 25th and being very tired I did not write any. We drew some Crackers. We
                                    brought in Some Rice haveing carried it fifty miles.
                        Wednesday Dec 21st
                        The report come into camp this morning the Rebels have evacuated Savannah. I wrote to
                                    Nett but did not mail it as the capture of the city was confirmed and we got orders
                                    to move to Town. The Rebels crossed the Savannah River near the city and went
                                    towards Charleston S.C. Where will they go now. They have no place to go that they
                                    can Stay for I think we will follow as soon as we rest a little and get supplies
                                    here. We did not move to day.
                        Thursday Dec 22nd
                        We had orders to be ready to move at noon but did not leave camp untill about one
                                    Oclock. We camped in an old Brick Yard about a mile from the Depot but can see the
                                    city. Lieut Starbuck and I walked down to the Depot. The Rebels left the city
                                    without doeing any damage and their heavy Seige guns remain in the works. We passed
                                    severel of them and there is one mounted at the Depot to guard the Rail Road. They
                                    have all the flood gates closed is the reason the country is coverd with water. In
                                    raiseing Rice they have to Inundate and those gates are approached by Cannals and
                                    used for that purpose. We got only two hundred prisoners but found about thirty
                                    thousand Bales of cotton in the city. This is a cold day. We are camped near the
                                    Macon Rail Road Track.
                        Friday Dec 23rd
                        We spent the day in prepareing quarters and as we had plenty of Brick and Lumber we
                                    erected quite a house and we have a nice camp. The mail came in and brought me three
                                    Letters from Nett,

                                    not write any. We got the news that "Old Pap Thomas" had given
                                    hood a terible drubbing at or near 
                                        Nashville

                                     we will soon go home. And if he cant do it let him send for us and we
                                    will go and help him. Genl Joe Johnston is commanding the Rebel Army here but I dont
                                    know where he has gone to. But we will soon hunt him up.34 I
                                    believe we will go north from here to

                                            command of troops in the region was premature. According to orders from
                                            Robert E. Lee dated February 22, 1865, Johnston was placed in command of two

                                    settled at once. Let Hood come too with the few men he has left.
                     
                  
               
                
            On January 20, 1865, the Seventy-Fifth Indiana left Savannah to begin the march through the
                    Carolinas, ostensibly to link up with Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant's forces in 
                        Virginia
                    . Moving through 
                        South Carolina
                     in early February, the Hoosiers advanced with some difficulty through swamps toward the
                    capital at 
                        Columbia
                    . Enemy opposition was practically nonexistent, as was the case in 
                        Georgia
                    , and they successfully reached the city by the middle of the month. With this leg of
                    the march completed, it was on to Fayetteville, 
                        North Carolina
                    .
            The Hoosiers had the honor of being the first organized Union troops into Fayetteville on March 11,
                    driving the Confederate rear guard ahead of them. After destroying the arsenal there, and taking a
                    four-day rest, the Federals pushed on to 
                        Goldsboro
                    , sixty miles away. The only serious opposition of the entire campaign came on the way
                    to 
                        Goldsboro
                     at Bentonville, where Sherman's old nemesis Joseph E. Johnston, who had assumed command
                    of Confederate forces in the region, sought to destroy both corps of Sherman's left wing in detail.
                    His first target was the Fourteenth Corps. The battle began on March 19, and the Seventy-Fifth
                    Indiana entered the fray the following morning. The Hoosiers kept up a brisk skirmishing fire and
                    were harassed by Confederate artillery in return, but by late afternoon Johnston retreated. On the
                    22nd the march for 
                        Goldsboro
                     resumed, and the Hoosiers arrived in the city the next day.
            By the time they reached 
                        Goldsboro
                    , Sherman's army had traveled more than four hundred miles in fifty days and had crossed
                    five large rivers. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Doan, commanding the Second Brigade, Third Division,
                    Fourteenth Army Corps, which included the Seventy-Fifth Indiana, paid tribute to his men in a report
                    written in late March at 
                        Goldsboro
                    :
            
                    During the campaign our troops have subsisted themselves on the country through which we have
                        passed with the exception of one-third ration of bread, sugar, and coffee…. During
                        the whole campaign, wherein we have marched nearly 500 miles and overcome difficulties perhaps
                        without a parallel, the officers and men of this command, with scarcely an exception, have
                        exhibited the most admirable and untiring patience, energy, and perseverance, and I am happy to
                        tender them my most sincere thanks.35
               
                
            
               General William J. Hardee technically commanded the Department of 
                     South Carolina, Georgia
                  , and 
                            Florida
                         from Savannah, while General P. G. T. Beauregard served as Hardee's superior in
                        command of the Military Division of the West. Ibid., ser. I, vol. XXXIX, part
                        1, p. 4, part 2, p. 880; ibid., vol. XLIV, p. 875.

            The army rested in 
                        Goldsboro
                     until April 10, then began the final stage of their march, some fifty miles to the city
                    of Raleigh. The Hoosiers of the Seventy-Fifth led the army, and on their way they claimed to have
                    fought the last battle and suffered the last combat casualty of Sherman's masterful campaign. The
                    regiment's skirmishers pushed the enemy before them and in a brisk fight captured the city of
                    Smithfield on April 11. Miller and his comrades were paid a rare compliment there by the commander
                    of the left wing, General Slocum. When Captain Mahlon Floyd reported for duty with the
                    Seventy-Fifth's skirmishers outside Smithfield, General Slocum asked if they were part of the same
                    regiment that had first entered Fayetteville. When he was told that indeed they were, he replied,
                    "I want no better; I will risk those fellows with anything."36
            
            The regiment successfully reached Raleigh on the 13th. On the way they were cheered by the news of
                    General Robert E. Lee's surrender at 
                        Appomattox
                     Courthouse, 
                        Virginia
                    . The Hoosiers then went into camp near Raleigh and awaited the surrender negotiations
                    between Sherman and Johnston. On April 26 the Confederate commander at last signed documents
                    requiring his men to lay down their arms. With this rebel army no longer a threat, the men could
                    look forward to returning home.
            Miller and his comrades set out from Raleigh on April 30, passed through 
                        Richmond
                    , the former Confederate capital, and arrived near 
                        Washington
                     on May 19. Five days later, Sherman's men passed up 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Avenue in a grand review before President Andrew Johnson, members of his Cabinet and
                    Congress, and the army's generals. Despite the scorching heat the marching was perfect, as the ranks
                    of the Seventy-Fifth Indiana filled the street from one side to the other and swept the avenue.
                    Military bands worked up the crowd to the "highest pitch," and they
                    enthusiastically cheered Sherman's Westerners.
            The Seventy-Fifth Indiana was officially mustered out of 
                        United States
                     service on June 8, 1865. The troops left 
                        Washington
                     the same day by train for Parkersburg, West 
                        Virginia
                    . There they embarked on a steamer for 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    , Indiana, then traveled by train again to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , where they arrived on June 14. Back in the state capital, where they had begun their
                    epic journey nearly three years before, the members of the regiment surrendered their muskets and
                    equipment at the state arsenal, then enjoyed a public reception hosted by Governor Oliver P. Morton
                    on the grounds of the capitol. On June 16 the proud 468 survivors of the Seventy-Fifth Indiana were
                    given their discharges and began their journey north to home.37
            
            William Bluffton Miller came back to 
                        Wells County
                    , Indiana, having survived some of the bloodiest fights of the Civil War, though

                     his painful wound from Chickamauga no doubt reminded him of how
                    perilously close to death or dismemberment he had come during his service. Miller found work as a
                    carpenter and druggist in various locations in northern Indiana and died in 
                  Charleston, Illinois
               , in 1918, always proud that he had helped the "sun of the
                    Confederacy" sink into "everlasting night" by serving in the ranks of
                    Sherman's army in the march to Savannah.38

            The 1998 Indiana Archives section of the Indiana Magazine of History surveys local
                    archival holdings in the southern part of Indiana. Although sectional borders in Indiana are often
                    in dispute, geography and two superhighways help demarcate the southern part of the state. Bounded
                    by the 
                        Ohio
                     and Wabash rivers and Interstates 70 and 74, the region's mostly
                    rolling topography distinguishes it from the northern two-thirds of the state. Southern Indiana is
                    predominantly rural and agricultural, although the terrain and the relatively poor quality of much
                    of the area's soil make farming sometimes difficult. It is heavily forested in places and dotted
                    elsewhere with coal mining operations, manifestations of recent industrial growth, and tourist
                    attractions. Its largest urban centers are at the southern edges of the region. The population of
                    the area has always been diverse, from the prehistoric people who gathered at Angel Mounds near
                    present-day 
                        Evansville
                     to the Indians who first came into contact with French explorers, traders, and
                    missionaries to the pioneer settlers who came from western 
                        North Carolina
                     and 
                        Virginia
                     and from eastern 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Tennessee
                    .
            The origins and timing of this migration and settlement make southern Indiana the oldest part of the
                    state and the site of many historical "firsts." Some can be readily noted. Many
                    consider 
                        Vincennes
                     the oldest city in Indiana. Clarksville is often identified as the first American
                    settlement in Indiana Territory. Corydon was Indiana's first state capital. 
                        Salem
                     residents produced one of the first newspapers in Indiana and the first literary work
                    published in the state. The first major public figures in Indiana history lived in its southern
                    region, among them Revolutionary War hero George Rogers Clark; William Henry Harrison, first
                    governor of Indiana Territory

                    encroachment by Confederate troops during the Civil War, and its young men were among the first

                    and girls, and led in the establishment of free public libraries, civic dramatics clubs, and
                    possibly the first women's club in America with a written constitution and bylaws.
            Yet southern Indiana's history goes beyond a list of precedents. Abraham Lincoln spent fourteen
                    formative years in 
                  Spencer county. Knox County
                was home to the colorful nineteenth century politician
                    James D. "Blue Jeans" Williams and the red haired, cigar-chomping comedian Richard
                    Bernard "Red" Skelton. In 
                        Orange County
                     can be found the huge dome of the former West Baden Springs Hotel, the equally imposing
                    French Lick Springs Hotel Golf and Tennis Resort—for years the headquarters of early
                    twentieth century Democratic party power broker Thomas Taggart—and evidence of mutual
                    respect between local residents and basketball legend Larry Bird. 
                        Evansville
                    , in 
                        Vanderburgh County
                    , offers still other perspectives through the careers of such one-time residents as
                    songwriter Paul Dresser; Julius W. Holder, general manager of the African-American weekly 
                        Evansville
                    
                    Argus; former mayor and 
                        United States
                     senator Vance Hartke; former governor Robert D. Orr; and Sallie Wyatt Stewart, a
                    teacher in the black schools of the city for fifty years as well as a successful businesswoman,
                    philanthropist, and civic leader.
            Through memorials, historic districts, and various other initiatives, southern Indianans have
                    demonstrated an acute sense of their region's past, and this year's contributors describe some of
                    the archival resources available for further research. Stephen L. Cochran and Mark V. Wetherington
                    outline the ways in which holdings in the 
                        Vincennes
                     area and at The Filson Club Historical Society in 
                        Louisville
                     provide a general overview of Indiana's oldest area. Josephine M. Elliott and Roger A.
                    Peterson focus on specific antebellum-era collections, showing how local history is made, preserved,
                    and later used for a variety of purposes. Gina Walker describes several archival collections that
                    help illuminate 
                        Evansville
                    's history in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Together these essays suggest the
                    range and diversity of sources available for exploration of two centuries of southern Indiana
                    history.
            
            VINCENNES AREA ARCHIVES
            The history and culture of southern Indiana begin in 
                        Vincennes
                    , and they are distinctly French.1 Moreover, while it is natural to
                    associate 
                        Vincennes
                     with the American Revolution because of the town's intimate ties to the western theater
                    of that war, the French Revolution also had an impact on this area of the state. The expulsion of
                    French clerics from 
                        Spain
                     in 1793 meant that many priests who had fled to 
                        Spain
                     from 
                        France
                     a year earlier were now forced elsewhere, and many, desiring missionary work, decided
                    on the 
                        United States
                    . Most of them ended up in the 
                        Vincennes
                     and 
                        Kaskaskia
                     areas because of the need for French speaking clerics there.2
            
            Any survey of archival resources in the 
                        Vincennes
                     area must take into consideration the long and varied geographic history of 
                        Knox County
                    . The county is the oldest—and one of the largest—of the
                    ninety-two counties in the state of Indiana. Its boundaries, which originally stretched from the
                        Ohio River north into 
                        Michigan
                    , have been significantly reduced with the passage of time. Anyone interested in pioneer
                    settlers of Indiana should therefore think of them as pioneer settlers of 
                        Knox County
                    ; for example, some archival resources that list "
                        Knox County
                     Church Records" actually cover churches that are outside present-day 
                        Knox County
                    .
            There are six major collections of archival material in 
                        Knox County
                    : the Old Cathedral Library & Museum, formerly known as the Brute Library and
                    now operated by the Catholic Diocese of 
                        Evansville
                    ; the Francis Vigo Chapter DAR Library; the 
                        Knox County
                     Public Library Historical Collection; the Lewis Historical Collections Library; the 
                        Knox County
                     Records Library; and the George Rogers Clark National Historical Park Library.
            
               The Old Cathedral Library & Museum is the oldest library in the state of
                    Indiana. First organized in 1794 around already existing parish records and the books of the Right
                    Reverend Benedict Joseph Flaget, the library continued to receive volumes from many well-known
                    missionaries, priests, and others who were occasional visitors to or residents of 
                        Vincennes
                    . The library includes books and manuscripts bearing the signatures and/or marginal
                    writings of Flaget, Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton, Father Edward Sorin, Francis

                            oldest settlements in the state. Established in 1732, it may have been inhabited just prior

                     diocese.
            By far the largest percentage of the collection is the result of a lifetime of book collecting by the
                    Right Reverend Simon William Gabriel Bruté de Remur, first bishop of 
                        Vincennes
                    . Bruté was a remarkable person by any measure. He was educated as a
                    physician and as a priest; twice he turned down offers to work for the French crown, instead joining
                    the Sulpicians and teaching at the seminary at Rennes. He came to the 
                        United States
                     in 1810 and in 1834 was appointed bishop of 
                        Vincennes
                    . He had been there for nearly a year before his books were floated down the
                        Ohio River to 
                        Louisville
                     on a flatboat, then hauled overland to 
                        Vincennes
                    .3
            
            While Bruté was a major benefactor of the collection, the parish records begin in
                    1749—nearly ninety years before Bruté's arrival—and reflect the
                    life of Catholic laity, both the French settlers and "les Savages." The
                    development of the library over time derives from two additional channels. One part contains
                    essentially books and records that every resident religious since Bruté has left the
                    library. The other part, running concurrently, consists of material donated by many parishioners,
                    known and unknown, over the passage of time.
            A knowledge of French and Latin is essential to derive maximum benefit from the Old Cathedral
                    collections. French was the dominant language of most of the inhabitants of 
                        Vincennes
                     until the 1820s, and roughly 75 percent of the collections are in French. A fair amount
                    is in Latin, and much of the correspondence between early French priests is a mixture of the two
                    languages.
            The Old Cathedral Library nonetheless facilitates research into the eighteenth century. It is
                    particularly rich in the areas of theology, dogma, religious studies, lives of the saints, sermons,
                    and homiletics. There is also a large collection of Bibles, exegetical and liturgical works, and
                    works on philosophy. The collection is surprisingly rich in medical materials and in original
                    documents relating to the French Revolution, natural history, geography, law, political economy,
                    general literature, botany, and lexicography. Manuscripts in the collection also include a papal
                    bull signed by John XXII, dated 1319, a letter signed by Saint Vincent de Paul, a facsimile of Saint
                    Isaac Jogues's "New Holland letter, sermons and sermon notes by the 
                        Vincennes
                     Diocese's first four bishops, songbooks, messages from French clerics to the pope
                    requesting succor during the French Revolution, and some of Bruté's correspondence.
            The Francis Vigo Chapter DAR Library has been growing since this chapter of the
                    Daughters of the American Revolution was

                    earliest projects was the acquisition, restoration, and maintenance of Grouseland, William Henry
                    Harrison's residence as territorial governor. The library has the Harrison papers on microfilm and a
                    fair amount of original material on Harrison dating from his 
                        Vincennes
                     days.
            The collection is roughly four hundred linear feet in size, has particular strength in 
                        Knox County
                     history, and contains a wealth of original genealogical material on families who were
                    early settlers in the 
                        Vincennes
                     area. Also in the collection are some county tax records prior to 1846, death records
                    for the city beginning in 1882, some original county death records, county mortuary records, and
                    many 
                        Knox County
                     church records. The library is also a good resource for those studying the DAR itself;
                    it has a complete run of DAR Magazine from 1910 to the present as well as most of
                    the other materials published by the DAR.

                    -area research. The Lewis collections have a much greater manuscript component than the
                    public library's collections. The Lewis materials also include a fine county history collection
                    covering over eighty Indiana counties and twenty-six 
                        Illinois
                     counties. The public library's collection has a very strong set of locally published,
                    privately printed family histories and a vast array of source material on 
                  Vincennes, Knox County
               ,
                    adjacent counties, and the state of Indiana.
            Both libraries feature sizable collections that facilitate research into pioneer settlement of the
                    entire area. Both have 
                        Vincennes city
                     directories that go back to the mid-1800s. Both have microfilm and fiche collections
                    that include the Draper manuscripts, the 
                        Vincennes
                    
                    Sun/Western Sun/Commercial/Sun Commercial newspaper, and county death records to
                    1880. Both have census data that begin in the early 1800s. Both also have book collections that
                    concentrate on the history of those states that provided most of Indiana's early settlers:
                            
                  Virginia, Pennsylvania
               , the Carolinas, 
                        Tennessee
                    , and the states of the Old Northwest.

                            Knox County
                         Records Library, operated jointly by the county commissioners and the 
                        Knox County
                     Public Library, houses many of the county's oldest original records. The Public Library
                    Historical Collections and the County Records Library are administered by the public library staff,
                    and the two collections are highly complementary. Included are records from the offices of the
                    county auditor, recorder, treasurer, and clerks of the circuit, superior, and probate courts. While
                    most of these records date from the twentieth century, many reach back to the early nineteenth
                    century and occasionally earlier. The auditors' records have commissioners' records from 1823 on in
                    thirty-nine volumes and tract books from 1818 to 1875. The 
                    recorders' records include deeds from 1814 to 1909 in ninety-four volumes, with an eighteen-volume
                    index, and mortgages from 1848 to 1955 in 178 volumes with a twenty-nine-volume index. The
                    treasurers' records include tax lists for the years 1802, 1804, and 1805 and tax duplicates for the
                    years 1846–1994, with additional years added annually. The clerks' circuit court records
                    include civil case files from 1796 to 1965, criminal case files from 1797 to 1954, execution dockets
                    from 1819 to 1955, probate records that include wills from 1824 to 1948, and guardianship case files
                    from 1808 to 1954.
            The final major 
                        Vincennes
                    -area facility that strongly supports primary research is the library at the George Rogers Clark National Historical Park. This library focuses on the
                    Revolutionary War era and George Rogers Clark, his companies, and his life in—and the
                    cultures and history of—the trans Appalachian frontier. It includes microfilm collections
                    of Clark's 
                        Virginia
                     papers and the Draper manuscripts. The facility also has very strong collections on the
                    period of the French and Indian War and the War of 1812.
            The above listing is far from exhaustive. Most of the early government records are in English, but
                    since quite a few of the wills in the early nineteenth century are in French, a knowledge of that
                    language is helpful though certainly not required.
            THE FILSON CLUB HISTORICAL SOCIETY
            The Filson Club Historical Society, 
                  Louisville,
                            Kentucky
               , was founded in 1884 as an
                    independent history research library. Its mission to "collect, preserve, and publish
                    historical material, especially that pertaining to 
                        Kentucky
                    " included the addendum "and adjacent states." This broader
                    collecting field has allowed The Filson Club to build a special collections department that is
                    regional in scope and contains material from the Upper South, the Ohio River
                    Valley, and "adjacent states" such as Indiana. The Filson Club's founders were
                    especially interested in the earliest periods of exploration and settlement in the Ohio
                        Valley; thus, their earliest publication series—which began in
                    1884—covers such topics as the explorations of Christopher Gist and the Battle of 
                        Tippecanoe
                    .
            The Filson Club's manuscript collections also reflect the founders' interest in the frontier era.
                    Manuscripts include letters that provide insights into many aspects of the early settlement of the
                    region: Indian-white conflict, land acquisition, daily life on the frontier, and the growth of towns
                    and cities. Among the earliest Indiana-related documents is a Revolutionary War letter written in
                    1779 by Joseph Bowman while on the American expedition against the British. Bowman gives a detailed
                    account of the retaking of 
                        Vincennes
                    . Over thirty years later, a letter written in 1811 by militiaman John Drummens to his
                    wife in 
                        Clark County
                     reflects the persisting cultural conflict on the frontier; Drummens speculated on a
                    possible march to "Shawneys  Prophets Town"
                    and rumors of peace. Most Indians and whites, he wrote, believed that there would be a battle, one
                    that would ultimately claim his life.
            Once the threat of Indian attack had passed and the land had been opened up for settlement, items in
                    a variety of collections describe the frontier process of immigration, land acquisition, and
                    settlement. Both the Clark-Hite and William Clark papers contain much information on land
                    transactions in territorial and antebellum Indiana, as do the Norvin Green, John Jeremiah Jacob,
                    Colonel Thomas Joyes, Francis 
                        Marion
                     Lee, and William Pope papers. The Francis Hegan Miller Collection alone includes many
                    land transactions between the commissioners appointed to apportion the 149,000 acres granted to
                    George Rogers Clark's 
                        Illinois
                     Regiment and the soldiers who qualified for land grants. In the Corlis-Respess Family
                    Papers a letter written by Jonathan Jennings in 1815 provides general information on the Indiana
                    Territory and assures prospective settlers that the inhabitants are protected by "mounted
                    riflemen." Documents in the Corlis Family Papers include an 1816 letter by George Corlis
                    noting the descent of three hundred immigrant families down the 
                        Ohio River
                    , all bound for Indiana. Correspondence by John Jencks, penned the following year,
                    describes the poor living conditions that frontier families encountered in the vicinity of 
                        Vincennes
                    .
            Indeed, so many people arrived in the Indiana Territory that there was a demand not only for land but
                    for basic household goods. Eliza Fry, writing from 
                        Crawfordsville
                    , Indiana, to John Speed near 
                        Louisville
                    , noted, "The emigration to this place is so great that there is such a demand
                    for furniture it is impossible for it to be made as fast as it is called for." She
                    predicted that 
                        Crawfordsville
                     "will be in a few years a great place." The establishment and growth
                    of Indiana's villages, towns, and cities are topics of frequent comment and description. A letter
                    written in 1815 describes the high quality of the soil in 
                        Sullivan County
                    , and subsequent correspondence from 
                        Vigo County
                     records the rapid development of the area and the establishment of the county seat at 
                        Terre Haute
                    . Hector Green, in an 1834 letter to his wife, describes 
                        Vincennes
                     as "this beautiful town," noting that the prairie on which it is
                    situated "excells in beauty anything I have ever imagined…." Attorney
                    Walter W. Blair's description of a tour through Indiana in 1846 included stops at
                            
                  Indianapolis, Lafayette, Terre Haute
               , and 
                        Vincennes
                    . At 
                        Vincennes
                     he considered putting out his shingle but soon discovered that lawyers before him had
                    been "starved out." In 1851 another traveler had an exciting visit in New 
                        Albany
                     where he witnessed a hanging and the explosion of a steam cylinder. In the early 1850s
                    one observer described 
                        Indianapolis
                     as the "Rail Road City of the West" and lauded the city's visible
                    symbols of antebellum reform-institutions for the care of the blind, deaf, and mentally
                    ill—as indications of social progress.
            
            Religious and moral issues were frequent topics of discussion in antebellum Indiana. The Martha Adams
                    Papers include a letter written in 1853 addressing the tension between economic prosperity and the
                    welfare of the soul. The "spirit of progress" and material gain, one of Adams's
                    correspondents wrote despairingly, came at the expense of religiosity. A diary (typescript copy)
                    kept by Indianan John Brown (1800–1872) during the early 1820s recalls a discussion
                    between 
                        Brown
                     and a 
                  Portland, Kentucky
               , tavern owner regarding the harboring of escaped 
                        Kentucky
                     slaves by citizens of Indiana.
            One of the largest groups of Indiana-related manuscript material at The Filson Club describes life
                    during the Civil War era. The Filson's founders were evenly divided between Confederate and Union
                    sympathizers and veterans. Because of this ideological conflict the collections reflect both sides
                    of the struggle. Their specific focus is the western theater, stretching from the Appalachian
                    Mountains to the Mississippi River. Given 
                        Kentucky
                    's strategic role as a border state, The Filson Club collects letters, diaries, and
                    images of soldiers who served in the commonwealth from other states as well as from 
                        Kentucky
                    . Many of the Union soldiers passing through 
                        Kentucky
                     on their way south joined units from midwestern states, including Indiana. The Civil
                    War diaries at The Filson Club include those of Johnson W. Culp and James W. Thomson. Culp, a
                    private in the 87th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment, begins his diary with his enlistment at 
                        La Porte
                    , then chronicles his subsequent move to Camp Morton and his experiences in the field in 
                        Kentucky
                    , from combat to guard duty. Thomson records the experiences of his unit, the 49th
                    Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment, as it moved through 
                        Kentucky
                     and became involved in campaigns in the vicinity of 
                        Cumberland Gap
                    . The Sperry-Gathright Family Papers contain the 1863 diary of David B. Sperry, a member
                    of the Fourth Indiana Battery. Sperry describes the more boring aspects of the soldier's
                    experience—camp life, diet, clothes, and finances—as well as the events that
                    broke the monotony—the execution of a deserter, skirmishes, and his unit's involvement in
                    battles at Stones River and Lookout Mountain, 
                        Tennessee
                    . A letter written by an unknown soldier who traveled through Indiana by railroad in
                    1863 records that the troops "lived high" on the food and welcome they received
                    and declares that Indiana "can furnish more prety girls than any other state in the
                    Union." In an 1862 letter in the Corlis-Respess Family Papers Jessee D. H. Corwine reveals
                    the divided loyalties of some citizens in southern Indiana when he concludes that southern
                    sympathizers "are having a great time recruiting here." During the following year
                    Henry B. Carrington wrote to Governor Oliver P. Morton concerning the Union Army's investigation of
                    John Hunt Morgan's raid. Carrington describes the damage done by Morgan's men and the need to
                    "see substantial justice done." Among the more unusual items in The Filson Club's
                    Civil War collections is a letter from James A. Thomas, a captured Confederate soldier  paroled in Indiana, complaining of the Union League's oppression of
                    Democrats in 
                        Sullivan County
                     in 1863.
            Among the items dealing with cultural life in Indiana during the twentieth century is a diary
                    (typescript copy) kept by Cora Miller Williams from 1907 to 1908 while attending St. Mary's College
                    in 
                        South Bend
                    . Her diary covers such topics as classes and lectures, religious activities, meals,
                    dormitory life, interaction with the nuns who ran the college, and recreation. The papers of Young
                    Ewing Allison frequently mention 
                        New Harmony
                    , Indiana, one item including a chronology of the owners and occupants of "The
                    old Fauntleroy House" in that community. The Mary Anderson de Navarro Papers, written
                    during the Great Depression to the rector of Mount Saint Francis Pro-Seminary in Floyds Knobs,
                    Indiana, reflect her deep faith and her memories of growing up Catholic in 
                        Louisville
                    .
            Among the visual representations of southern Indiana at The Filson Club are items in the library's
                    map collection. Nineteenth-century maps provide considerable information on the location of
                    individual farms, houses, roads, steam and railway connections, and water courses in the vicinity of
                    Clarksville, 
                        Jeffersonville
                    , and New 
                        Albany
                    . The Falls of the 
                        Ohio
                     are the subject of numerous surveys and canal plans throughout the 1860s. The
                    photographic collection contains a visual record of steamboating on the 
                        Ohio
                    .
            General information regarding hours of operation, membership, programs, and publications is available
                    at The Filson Club's World Wide Web site: www.filsonclub.org.
            THE ARCHIVES OF NEW HARMONY
            The archival holdings in 
                        New Harmony
                    , Indiana, center on the historical background of this small Indiana town. Although the
                    archives contain some Harmony society material, most of the manuscript collections cover the
                    Owen-Maclure period (1825–1827) and the years up to the Civil War.4
            
            Four archival repositories exist in 
                        New Harmony
                    . The oldest, most extensive, and most accessible institution, the 
                        New Harmony
                     Workingmen's Institute, is also the only one with a catalogued collection. Preservation
                    and tourism are the special responsibility of Historic 
                        New Harmony
                    , which maintains a professionally arranged archives with material available by
                    appointment. The 
                        New Harmony
                     State Historic Site owns valuable historic collections that can be used by special
                    arrangement. Historic 
                        New Harmony
                     and the State Historic Site represent the Unified Program by which the State of Indiana
                    Division of Museums and Historic Sites and the University of Southern Indiana operate 
                        New Harmony
                    's historic district. The 
                  
                     4 George Rapp and the Harmony Society founded the town of 
                                New Harmony
                             in 1814 and remained for ten years.
               
                     Owen Family Papers collection is privately owned and generally
                    unavailable to the public.
            The archival materials in the 
                  
                            New Harmony
                         Workingmen's Institute encompass the history of 
                        New Harmony
                     beginning with its pre-Harmonist times through the two communitarian experiments and
                    continuing to the present. Included are letters, personal papers, business and legal papers,
                    journals, account books, maps, newspapers, photographs, microfilms, and tapes. Among the most valued
                    records are the bound volumes of Robert Owen's communal experiment in 
                        New Harmony
                     incorporating minutes, accounts, ledgers, daybooks of the different departments,
                    community dances, and music.
            Other collections delineate the life and times of the town during and after the Owen-Maclure period.
                    Unparalleled in their depiction of 
                        New Harmony
                     during the years 1826–1831 are the 478 letters of William Maclure and Marie
                    Duclos Fretageot. Maclure's geological journals describe that science in its early European stages.
                    The Branigin-Owen Papers, Carol Baldwin Allen Collection, and a large collection of personal Owen
                    papers cover the Owen family and descendants. William Pelham's letters to his son
                    (1825–1827), the epistolary narrative of the son's schoolboy endeavors as one of Joseph
                    Neef's pupils (1809–1815), and the father's bookseller days in 
                        Boston
                     and relationship to the artist Sir John Copley also reveal the early days of the Owen
                    experiment. The collection of the Phiquepal d'Arusmont family—William S. Phiquepal,
                    Frances Wright's husband, their daughter, and descendants—describes a system of musical
                    notation and an original phonetic system involving stenography devised in 1825. Fretageot family
                    members—the most prominent being Madame Marie Duclos Fretageot, a friend, agent, and
                    correspondent of William Maclure—and their lives are well covered in the groups of papers
                    and bound business journals given to the Workingmen's Institute regularly over the years.
            The local people of later generations also left their mark. The Golden family, a famous theatrical
                    traveling troupe of the 1860s to the turn of the century, left a significant group of materials
                    consisting of personal papers, diaries, original scripts, plays, playbills, music, and photographs.
                    (Many other items spanning the years 1880–1920 are at the 
                        New Harmony
                     State Historic Site.) Dr. Edward Murphy (1813–1900) and Joyce Isabella Mann
                    (1886–1970) were also benefactors of the institute. The Elliott family papers are a
                    treasure trove for researchers seeking information on young college students writing home during the
                    mid-to-late nineteenth century. Historian and professor Ross Lockridge, Sr., director of the first 
                        New Harmony
                     Memorial Commission, retained a number of documents on the state's preservation
                    programs. These documents complement the papers of the Memorial Commission in the 
                        New Harmony
                     State Historic Sites Archives. The Vreeland Collection covers the years from the 1930s
                    to the 1970s and attempts to analyze the social, political, and economic  factors in 
                        New Harmony
                    's development. This sociological undertaking reflects a purpose similar to that of
                    Robert S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd in the 1930s.
            Three literary manuscript collections should also be mentioned: Caroline Dale Snedeker's book
                    manuscripts, the collection of her niece Caroline Baldwin Allen, and Celia Morris Eckhardt's
                    writings. The work of the first two women overemphasizes Owen family myth and largely disregards
                    documentation. Eckhardt's biography of Frances Wright is the best to date, and her papers include
                    many of the sources that she used in writing her book.
            The business and social organizations of 
                        New Harmony
                    , dating from the second decade of the nineteenth century, are well documented. The
                    Harmonie Associates, once a community development association, Red Geranium Enterprises, and
                    Historic 
                        New Harmony
                     are all actively engaged in making as well as preserving history. The records of
                    companies now defunct but important to the local scene include the business books of the Shoultz
                    Funeral Home, containing much genealogical data, and the Golden Raintree Association, which
                    sponsored theatrical events and the Ross Lockridge, Jr., pageant from the 1920s to the 1960s.
                    Although the Keck-Gonerman Company of Mt. Vernon has gone out of business, the
                    manuals for its threshing machines and tractors are still eagerly sought by owners of its equipment.
            The rare maps, indicating landowners in the town, township, and county, furnish information predating
                    the coming of the Harmonists.
            In answering inquiries the first and last resort for the Workingmen's Institute staff is the Local
                    History File. This resource consists of thousands of handwritten and typed 3″
                    × 5″ cards—sometimes pasted with newspaper
                    clippings—cataloging a cumulative history of 
                        New Harmony
                     and 
                        Posey County
                    . Begun in 1908 and continued to date, the cards contain information about the physical
                    makeup of the town, its residents, events, and historical facts.
            The audiovisual section—photographs, microfilms, tapes, and films—supports the
                    manuscript collection. Photographs taken by William F. Lichtenberger from around the 1870s to the
                    1920s, with Homer Fauntleroy picking up the task into the 1950s, made possible the continuation of
                    the preservation and restoration of 
                        New Harmony
                    . The microfilming of portions of the manuscripts and most local newspapers has aided in
                    the preservation of the documentary record.5 Another part of the audiovisual
                    section includes taped interviews with people who lived during the turn of the century or
                    experienced 
                  
                     5 Since the Harmony Society took its records when it moved from
                            Indiana in 1824, very little Harmonist material is located in 
                                New Harmony
                            . The Workingmen's Institute does, however, have a large microfilm series of
                            thirty-one reels (1804–1830) exhibiting manuscripts from the Economy Archives
                            (originals at the 
                                Pennsylvania
                             State Archives, 
                                Harrisburg
                            ).
               
                     life during World War I, survived the Depression and the 1930s,
                    enjoyed the oil boom, and lived through World War II and thereafter.
            The archival holdings of Historic 
                            New Harmony
                        
               , the agency in charge of the interpretation and preservation of 
                        New Harmony
                    's historic museums, consist of two types of records. The unprocessed business records
                    of this organization from its beginnings in 1974 to the present are held here. The papers duplicated
                    from various repositories (the Workingmen's Institute, the 
                        Philadelphia
                     Academy of Natural Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the Historical Society
                    of 
                        Pennsylvania
                    ) and used for background information and restoration work or those created in the
                    process of starting educational house museums and exhibits, such as the two models of 1824 
                        New Harmony
                    , also reside here.
            Numerous folders contain information on each designated building, such as block location,
                    descriptions, photographs, and drawings of intended alterations. The extensive collection of
                    architectural plans includes the working drawings for all major recent additions to the community,
                    even structures not owned by Historic 
                        New Harmony
                     such as the Roofless Church. This part of the collection also contains restoration
                    drawings for many of the historic buildings, especially the facades in the commercial area. There
                    are interior plans for a number of the house museum exhibition spaces. Architect Richard Meier's
                    plans for the prize winning Atheneum are extensive.
            The cartographic collection contains originals and copies, as well as "created"
                    maps. The originals are rare historic maps of 
                        New Harmony
                    , and the copies reproduce all maps of the town known to exist. The
                    "created" maps are extensive and varied. Many were based on information found on
                    the Sanborn insurance maps published by the D. A. Sanborn National Insurance Diagram Bureau, which
                    became the Sanborn Map Company in 1902. Maps of the Harmony Society's land acquisitions from 1815 to
                    1824 indicate original landowners. The geological and mineralogical travels of William Maclure,
                    Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, and Gerard Troost are meticulously re-created from letters and personal
                    accounts. There are comprehensive planning and development maps illustrating projected land use. A
                    series of historical maps for the years 1824, 1843, 1887, 1907, 1973, and 1982 greatly extend the
                    history of the community.
            Another important source of information on the Harmony Society period is the Karl J. R. Arndt
                    Collection, which combines photocopies of Harmonist material that was formerly in the Economy, 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , archives with Arndt's personal collection. Written in both German and English and
                    classified by subject matter, the papers deal with people, agriculture, religion, the economy, land
                    holdings, and other subjects.
            A group of local 
                        Posey County
                     people have provided insights into 
                        New Harmony
                     life during World War II in oral history interviews accompanied by transcriptions.
            
            The photographic and slide collection presents an architectural and social history of 
                        New Harmony
                     from 1974 to 1985, its period of most active restoration. The thousands of originals
                    give a meticulous account of social events, the restoration work, and the reconstruction of the
                    community. The already named institutions plus the Joslyn Art Museum of Omaha, 
                        Nebraska
                    , and the Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle of Le Havre, 
                        France
                    , are the main sources for the prints, negatives, and transparencies of artist
                    naturalist Charles-Alexandre Lesueur's American sketches and for Karl Bodmer's sketches for Travels in the Interior of North America, 1832–1834 by Maximilian zu
                    Weid-Neuweid, his great patron. In addition to the pictures, all the manuscript sources,
                    Maximilian's unpublished personal journal, the entire text and plates of his book, plus
                    correspondence, plans, and brochure suggestions create a unique display—the
                    Maximilian-Bodmer exhibition.
            The block-by-block system used for indentifying much of the material in the archives is an original
                    one devised specifically for 
                        New Harmony
                     records, thereby rendering research easier and clearer. It all amounts to a remarkable
                    physical history of 
                        New Harmony
                    —something never before attempted by any local collection or repository.
            The manuscripts that comprise the collections of the 
                  
                            New Harmony
                         State Historic Site were initially gathered in what became two historic state
                    properties: by Mary Emily Fauntleroy in the Old Fauntleroy Home and by the Slater family, who
                    published their newspaper, the 
                        New Harmony
                    
                    Register, in Harmonist Community Building No. 2.
            Mary Emily Fauntleroy, related by marriage to the Owens and an enthusiastic preserver of 
                        New Harmony
                    's history and historic buildings, purchased the Old Fauntleroy Home in 1911 from a
                    Fauntleroy descendant. In it she accumulated papers relating to the Fauntleroy family and the home,
                    as well as some early 1820s Owen family letters and poetry.
            Among other 
                        New Harmony
                     State Historic Site documents are the records of the Minerva Society. Founded in 1859,
                    the society was one of the earliest women's clubs in the 
                        United States
                     with a written constitution. Also available are some of the papers of geologist Edward
                    Travers Cox (1821–1907), who learned his profession under David Dale Owen and went on to
                    become Indiana state geologist. A group of forty or so original drawings offers potential for
                    research in early engineering. The work of Oliver Evans, Jr., son of the noted eighteenth-century
                    inventor, and Robert Henry Fauntleroy, surveyor and inventor, illustrates various proposed machines.
                    A recent acquisition of three letters written by Frederick Rapp to his agent, Richard Flower of
                    Albion, 
                        Illinois
                     (August-November, 1824), documents the sale of the Harmony Society's town to Robert
                    Owen. The Homer Fauntleroy photographic collection, incorporating the work of photographer  William Lichtenberger, depicts people, places, and town events.
                    Charles and Harry Hater's print shop papers cover the years 1857 to 1932 (with time out for the
                    Civil War) and present a long and varied history of the community. The office files of the first 
                        New Harmony
                     Memorial Commission (late 1930s-mid-1950s) contain correspondence and research
                    materials gathered by Ross Lockridge, Sr., as the executive director of the 
                        New Harmony
                     restoration. These documents record the first attempt on the part of the state of
                    Indiana to preserve and restore 
                        New Harmony
                     as a site of historical importance.
            The Owen Family Papers, a private collection owned by Kenneth Dale Owen,
                    great-great-grandson of Robert Owen, include the correspondence and papers of the five children of
                    Robert Owen, their descendants, and some of the distinguished persons who joined the Owen-Maclure
                    community. The period covered is 1795 to the present. In addition to the manuscripts the collection
                    contains a large group of original drawings, many depicting scenes in and around 
                        New Harmony
                     during the Owen-Maclure community days. They are the work of the numerous artists
                    living in the town during that period, most notably Lesueur and Robert Owen's third son, David Dale
                    Owen.
            RECORDS OF OWEN COUNTY
            The Indiana General Assembly mandates the local and state records that a county must keep.
                    Unfortunately, many counties have, at various times, destroyed records despite this mandate;
                    fortunately, most of 
                        Owen County
                    's records have been preserved and are readily available.
            The main research records held in the 
                        Owen County
                     Archives are the Deed Books, the Complete Record Books of the various courts, the
                    Complete Probate Books, the County Commissioners' Books, and the various packets containing the
                    files associated with the court books. These packets contain the papers presented to the court and
                    are the documents from which the court books were written. They are valuable because they contain
                    information not included in the transcripts, such as the names of witnesses, subpoenas of the
                    defendant and/or plaintiff, fees, and margin notes.
            A county courthouse contains many records that are of interest to a historian or genealogist. Once
                    researchers identify persons in a group (Germans) or a profession (coal miners) in which they are
                    interested, they should start with the Deed Books and, while abstracting land transactions, continue
                    to search for more names. Since, in 
                        Owen County
                    , African Americans have been studied extensively in the county records, this group is
                    used in the following examples. Until 1856 many contracts and agreements were recorded in the Deed
                    Books so that, if necessary, this information could be entered as evidence in a court trial. Among
                    the non-land entries found in the Deed Books are free papers, that is, affidavits issued by counties
                    in southern  states declaring that African Americans who left
                    those states did so as free persons. These papers usually name the parents, spouse, and children,
                    thereby providing additional names. Sometimes interesting details are included, such as in the case
                    of Aaron Roberts, where it is noted that his father, Ishmael Roberts, was "an old
                    revolutionary soldier in the 10th Regiment of infantry under Col. Shepherd" during the War
                    for Independence. Aaron's wife, Sarah, is also named, and the paper states that her father, Edward
                    Newsom, also served in the army during the Revolution. The paper is dated 1830, Chatham County, 
                        North Carolina
                    .6 Researchers now have the name of Aaron Roberts, who is in the
                    1830 
                        Owen County
                     census, and the names of his father, his wife, his father-in-law, and his daughter
                    Candasa, aged four, whose grandfathers were in the Revolution. Aaron Roberts's brother, Parden Boen
                    Roberts, also had a free paper recorded that notes that Ishmael's wife was named Silvia, that there
                    apparently was another brother named Ishmael, Jr., and that they had been in Chatham County, 
                        North Carolina
                    , since before 1810.
            The name of the first purchaser of a section of government land is not recorded in the Deed Books but
                    in volumes entitled Land Entry Books. These books record patents issued by the various 
                        United States
                     land offices when the purchase was made. It is here that researchers learn that
                    Elizabeth Akins bought forty acres of government land in 
                        Owen County
                     in 1837.7 Subsequent transactions are in the Deed Books. Here the
                    search begins with the deed index books, which contain much information about the grantor (seller),
                    the grantee (buyer), location and description of the property, the date of the deed, price, type of
                    deed, and the deed book and page where the deed is recorded. These deed index books should be very
                    carefully examined before searching. Some books will be indexed with the grantors and grantees
                    intermixed; some have the grantors indexed in the front of the book and the grantee indexed in the
                    back.
            Occasionally some additional personal information can be found in the Deed Books, such as the wife's
                    name, the residence of some persons not currently residents, and family relationships. For instance,
                    one deed book entry states that William Chandler's wife is named Clara and that the couple lived in 
                        Vigo County
                    , Indiana, in 1853.8 Another notes that Clayborn Harris lived in
                            
                  Cass County, Michigan
               , in 1865.9
            
            Although most of the material in the County Commissioners' Record Books have to do with building and
                    maintaining roads, bridges, and other county property, other matters also came before the
                    commissioners. 
                  
                     6 Deed Book 3, p. 280, 
                                Owen County
                             Courthouse, 
                                Spencer
                            , Indiana.
                  
                     7 Township 9, Range 4, NE:NW—-Section 18, 36 &
                            50/100 acres, Land Entry Book 1, ibid.
                  
                  
                     8 Deed Book 12, p. 550, ibid.
                  
                  
                     9 Deed Book 22, p. 120, ibid.
                  
               
                     Maintaining county property opened up opportunities for some
                    political patronage. For example, the contract for custodial services for the courthouse was likely
                    reserved for members of the black community. Richard Walden was a regular recipient of these
                    contracts. He received twenty-five cents for sweeping out the courthouse doorway on the first day of
                    the September term, 1833, and one dollar during the August session, 1834.10
                    Walden probably paid someone else to do the work since he was quite prosperous.
            The 
                        Owen County
                     commissioners also issued various licenses, such as the one Walden received to vend
                    groceries and liquors in 1833 and other years.11 Licenses required bonding, and
                    since no bonding companies existed, local property owners guaranteed payment of the bond in case of
                    default. For example, "Now is presented the Bond of Richard Walden with Benjamin Leonard,
                    John Galletly, Samuel Scott, Joseph Cocheran and Pardon B. Roberts his securities conditioned as the
                    law requires of Grocery keepers in the sum prescribed by law which bond acknowledged by the obligers
                    in open court and said bond and security is approved by the board and ordered filed."12 The makeup of the guarantors is interesting. Scott was the sheriff, Cocheran
                    a justice of the peace and later commissioner, and Roberts an African American active in buying and
                    selling town 10ts.13
            
            The greatest number of county records are those from the various courts and are found under the
                    county clerk's jurisdiction. To gain an understanding of court records John J. Newman's Research in Indiana Courthouses: Judicial and Other Records (1981) is essential. 
                        Owen County
                     civil and criminal files from 1836 through 1856 have been entered into a database and
                    can be searched for any subject. The database contains 1,056 civil and 1,982 criminal cases. Cases
                    before 1836 are found in the Complete Order Books, but the books do not have the detail of the
                    files.
            The Complete Probate Books provide the historian with a wealth of information, particularly the
                    intestate records. These books note a person's death and often list personal property such as guns,
                    books, quilts, farm tools, bedding, kitchen utensils, and horses and other livestock. 
                        Owen County
                     has all of its books and about one thousand intestate files indexed and filed from
                    around 1826 to 1871. Bills presented to and from the estate are also in these files. About one
                    hundred physicians' bills, some giving detailed courses of treatment, as well as bills from
                    merchants, with detailed accounts of goods purchased, can be found in the Probate Books. Also of
                    value are the store inventories of merchants who have died. Two additional sources are mortgage
                    books and the agricultural censuses of 1850–1880, which

            THE ARCHIVES OF EVANSVILLE
            Although all repositories in the 
                        Evansville
                     region strive to acquire, preserve, and service local history materials, Willard Library is distinguished by the size and quality of its collections.
            The library's Regional and Family History Center has been operating since 1976 and focuses on fifty
                    counties in the tri state (Indiana, 
                  Kentucky,
                            Illinois
               ) area and the states and
                    counties responsible for the migration of people to this region. Censuses; bound family histories
                    and genealogies; migration, naturalization, land, and military records; and sources such as marriage
                    records, wills, and tax lists can be found here. The general collections consist of personal papers
                    of prominent community members such as social worker and reformer Albion Fellows Bacon and her
                    sister, author Annie Fellows Johnston; the Foster Dulles family; community leaders Emily Clifford
                    Orr and William Gumberts; and the business records of Norman A. Shane, Schaefer and Sons Funeral
                    Home, Graham-Paige Car Company, and Mesker Steel, Inc.
            Scores of local history societies were born at the turn of the twentieth century as a result of the
                    preservation movement in the 
                  United States. Evansville
               's exemplar was the Southwestern Indiana
                    Historical Society, whose longtime president was Judge John Iglehart. His papers represent the work
                    of this group not only in 
                        Evansville
                     but also in nearby towns like Mt. Vernon and 
                        New Harmony
                     and the surrounding counties.
            The photographic and postal card collections number over fifteen thousand glass plates and prints
                    picturing the city, its people, buildings, and activities through many decades. At least a third
                    were taken by Karl Kae Knecht, cartoonist for the 
                        Evansville
                    
                    Courier from 1906 to 1962. The outstanding microfilm collection of several
                    thousand films is excellent for genealogical research. In addition to the regional census
                    information, there are newspaper runs of 
                        Evansville
                     and neighboring county English-language papers covering the entire period from 1821 to
                    the present. The German-language newspapers cover the years from 1859 to 1918.
            The Willard Library has also become the owner of the Vander-burgh County Archives. They add another
                    dimension to the resources available.
            The archives of the 
                  
                            Evansville
                         Museum of Arts and Science include two types of papers: the official records
                    of the institution and those relating to the history and development of 
                        Evansville
                     and the larger community. The first category has been professionally organized and made
                    available for staff use. The second group has not been processed with library patrons in mind
                    because this is not the mission of the museum. Nevertheless, the staff services the local  history portion of the holdings, which include personal
                    correspondence; the James Lowry Orr Papers; business, school, and church records; documents
                    pertaining to the 
                        Evansville
                     Suburban and 
                        Newburgh
                     Railway Company (1888–1948); artists' biographies; and newspaper clippings.
            Most valuable in the museum's collections are the more than twelve thousand photographs, many of them
                    views of the 
                        Evansville
                     shipyards during World War II. The photographs have been divided into the following
                    categories: portraits (emphasis on costumes), persons in groups, buildings (interiors), 
                        Evansville
                     (panoramic views), street scenes, individual buildings, transportation and machinery,
                    and floods.
            Although it does not consider itself as servicing manuscript material, the University
                        of 
                            Evansville
                        
                holds an excellent collection of university archives dating from the days of
                    its predecessor, Moore's Hill College, from 1854 to the present. The minutes of the Conference of
                    the Methodist Church (1852–1975) are valuable for accounts of the ministers and their
                    families. The holdings also include records of the functioning units of the university; biographical
                    information on faculty, staff, other personnel, and students; all aspects of student activities and
                    organizations; financial records; photographs of individuals, groups, and campus buildings; and
                    newspapers covering special events.
            The university archives have relatively few papers of local families or groups. Exceptions are the
                    Orr Family Personal Collection and the business records of the Orr Iron Company. Also uncommon and
                    exceptional is the Knecht Collection of ten thousand original cartoons.
            Begun in 1972, the University of Southern Indiana Special Collections and University
                        Archives is the latest repository to be established in the 
                        Evansville
                     area. Its mission has been the collection of local and regional material, with special
                    emphasis on the African-American, German, and Jewish communities. Some specific collection groups
                    include:
            
               Local Authors. Original manuscripts, galley sheets, and research materials comprise
                    this collection. Among the authors represented are Kenneth McCutchan, Vardine Moore, Marilyn Durham,
                    Dallas Sprinkles, Darrel Bigham, and Ronald Roat.
            
               Black History.
                    
                        Evansville
                    's black history is represented in a collection of photographs, oral history interviews,
                    newspaper accounts, and other printed materials.
            
               Local Businesses. The Mead Johnson and Company Archives contain papers concerning
                    company administration and organization, industrial and public relations, marketing and
                    merchandising, product histories, research and development, the personal papers of D. Mead Johnson,
                    sample products, and memorabilia. Other business collections on file include the Burch Plow Works,
                    Inc., Indiana  Furniture Company, Mesker Steel, Inc., and
                    printed reports and oil well logs from the local petroleum industry.
            
               Local Organizations. Minutes of meetings, scrapbooks, reports, and photographs of
                    local organizations are located in this department. The Visiting Nurse Association, American
                    Association of University Women, League of Women Voters, and American Management Society are a few
                    of the local groups represented.
            
               Local Government. This collection began in 1972 when government records were
                    removed from the basement of the 
                        Evansville City
                     Hall, which was about to be razed. Mayoral administrations from 1886 to 1971 are
                    represented, as well as cemetery records, various items from the Department of Public Safety,
                    minutes of the Common Council, 1918–1958, city ordinances, 1914–1917, and maps
                    of 
                        Evansville
                     and 
                        Vanderburgh County
                    . The papers of the 
                        Evansville
                     Bar Association contain biographical sketches of its members, 1929–1958,
                    minutes and reports of committees, agreements, rosters of members and committees, memorials,
                    accounts, and correspondence.
            
               Indiana Labor History. The product of a yearlong project in which members of labor
                    unions from the 1930s to the 1960s were interviewed, this collection consists of interviews,
                    transcripts, convention ribbons, photographs, union newspapers and pamphlets, and arbitration
                    materials.
            
               Regional History. This collection of materials on Indiana, 
                        Kentucky
                    , and 
                        Illinois
                     includes books, photographs, newspaper clippings, oral history interviews, annual
                    reports from county offices, brochures, newsletters, and several University of Southern Indiana
                    student papers.
            
               Communal Studies Group. The Center for Communal Studies Archives include materials
                    on approximately one hundred historic communes as well as information on several hundred
                    contemporary communities. Shakers, Harmonists, Oneidans, the Communal Studies Association, the
                    Fellowship for Intentional Community, and the Inspirationists of Amana are among the groups
                    represented.
            
               Karl J. R. Arndt Papers. Not yet ready for public use but worthy of mention is the
                    enormous collection of personal and professional papers representing Karl J. R. Arndt's lifetime
                    work on the Harmony Society. The papers are a remarkable concentration of information on the
                    communal group important to southern Indiana.
            
               Oral History. In addition to interviews of local citizens, civic and professional
                    leaders, and businessmen and businesswomen, persons of German descent describe how they maintain
                    their German heritage.
            The university archives' photographic and slide collections reflect the work of local and regional
                    photographers. Several hundred negatives of 
                        Evansville
                     and surrounding counties were taken by Thomas Mueller, a photographer for the

                    : Indiana Historical Society, 1997. Pp. xxvi, 174. Illustrations, appendix, notes,
                    bibliographical essay, index. $24.95.)
            At first glance, the subject of this book, a male, upper middle-class intellectual, might seem less
                    than worthy. He distrusted ethnic minorities and, in part out of political partisanship, worked for
                    passage of a new state constitution that would restrict their franchise. He reinvigorated his state
                    historical society and state library, in part as a means of increasing the availability of materials
                    for his own literary activities. Finally, he lost his position as city comptroller, in large measure
                    because of suspicion that he was part of a scheme that allowed the mayor improperly to receive city
                    funds.
            In this instance, as is often true, first glances are deceiving. This book, as it turns out, is both
                    important and fascinating. Indeed, the author provides a case study of the Progressive movement in
                    the 
                        United States
                     and gives a balanced portrayal of an individual who—while achieving neither
                    fame nor elective office—left a remarkable legacy of public service. At the same time,
                    Ray E. Boomhower has revealed in yet another way the connection between culture and politics in the 
                        United States
                    .
            Whatever his foibles (most of which he shared with his contemporaries), Dunn, Boomhower points out,
                    heeded his convictions—based on the ideals of Thomas Jefferson—that democracy
                    depended upon a citizenry with knowledge of what had gone before and a willingness to draw upon that
                    knowledge to prevent or remedy the abuses common in government, such as greed and lust for power.
                    Dunn, accordingly, believed that historical scholarship was inseparable from citizenship. Knowledge
                    from painstaking research in the documents, he believed, would make the past accessible as a
                    resource essential for sound public policy. One is reminded here of Dunn's contemporaries, Theodore
                    bsevelt and Woodrow Wilson, and another famous Hoosier of earlier years, General Lew Wallace.
            Dunn's contribution, Boomhower shows, originated in the liberal arts tradition of the Protestant
                    institutions of the nineteenth-century American Midwest (in this case the Methodist church and
                    Earlham College). Dunn used his inveterate optimism, faith in the judgment of an educated citizenry,
                    analytical abilities, and fascination with history to improve society. By the time his life was over
                    in 1924, at age sixty-nine, he had obtained a law degree from the University of 
                        Michigan
                     and written numerous books and articles, including a widely acclaimed study of Indian
                    policy in the West, histories of 
                        Indianapolis
                     and of Indiana, and an authoritative dictionary of 
                    the Miami Indian language. He helped put on a permanent footing the Indiana Historical Society
                    (becoming its secretary) and the Indiana State Library (serving four years as state librarian). He
                    assisted in establishing a system of local public libraries in the state and was a major influence
                    in the state Democratic party. He helped to reform the government of 
                        Indianapolis
                    ; lobbied successfully for the secret ballot; and, to eliminate corruption, proposed a
                    new, Progressive constitution for the state. The latter action, while not successful, gave its most
                    prominent supporter, Hoosier Governor Thomas R. Marshall, sufficient national acclaim to be elected
                    vice-president of the 
                        United States
                     in 1912.
            This brief and readable biography is a contribution to the history not just of Indiana but of the 
                        United States
                    . Drawing upon the resources that his subject did so much to preserve, Boomhower has
                    performed a task worthy of his subject.

                    index. $35.00.)
            Readers of this journal should find David L. Kimbrough's study of the grandfather, indeed the family,
                    of Booth Tarkington of considerable interest. Carefully researched, lavishly documented, full of
                    intriguing anecdotes and asides, the volume will repay careful attention.
            The problems are few—the mistaken declaration that Methodist classes chose their own
                    leaders, exhorters, and even circuit riders (p. 3); the failure to recognize John Fletcher's Checks (1835) as a centerpiece of Methodist apologetics (p. 48); the
                    interpretation of "location" as moving to another circuit instead of leaving the
                    itinerancy altogether (p. 66); the failure to explain Joseph Tarkington's role as presiding elder,
                    his most important ministerial office (pp. 102ff.); the equation of early nineteenth-century
                    seminaries (secondary schools) with later theological seminaries. These few problem stand out
                    because of the otherwise erudite treatment of Methodism. The bibliography and citations are quite
                    remarkable, ranging from obscure early accounts to the most recent interpretive breakthroughs.
            More vexing is the organization of the volume, which chronicles the life of Tarkington and depicts
                    through his experience the transformation of Methodism from plain-style frontier, dualistic
                    evangelicalism into a genteel faith. Both tasks invite a chronological narration, in which direction
                    Kimbrough in fact proceeds successfully  for the first third of
                    the volume. And at times thereafter he advances conference year by conference year. The introduction
                    details the character of frontier Methodism, and the conclusion, in briefer fashion, describes its
                    genteel outcome. Those sections are quite instructive. Chapter one covers "Joseph
                    Tarkington's Birth and Early Life," and chapter two continues the theme of the
                    introduction—"Religion in Early Indiana." In these chapters and also in
                    chapter three, "The Tarkington Family Moves to Indiana," Kimbrough builds rather
                    nicely around the Tarkington autobiography.
            As his sections on Tarkington's ministerial career unfold, however, Kimbrough occasionally uses
                    flashbacks and asides that interrupt the narrative and provide information or insight that could
                    well have been used earlier. For instance, as Tarkington is being drawn from the role of class
                    leader into preaching and is taken to his first conference, Kimbrough provides an excursus on the
                    earlier development of Methodist conference structure (p. 57) that might more readily have come in
                    chapter two. At the end of the chapter (p. 67), he makes a similar reversion in time, here to
                    provide membership statistics for Methodism. In "A Young Preacher Weds," Kimbrough
                    understandably recalls the deceased Francis Asbury's injunctions that his preachers not marry, but
                    he then reverts to a discussion of the married estate among clergy from Cotton Mather on and of
                    female percentages among church members during and after the Revolution. Kimbrough uses Tarkington's
                    involvement with temperance in the later 1830s to rehearse the movement's earlier emergence (pp.
                    90–93). After settling Tarkington in 
                        Greensburg
                    , Indiana, in 1851, Kimbrough devotes the bulk of the chapter (pp. 109-18) to various
                    indices of Methodist gentility, ranging from the 1830s to the 1880s for data and detail.
                    Tarkington's roles in semi-retirement also invite thematic flashbacks (pp. 139, 142, 143, 150).
            In a more vexing defiance of chronology, Kimbrough carries the reader through the 1830s and 1840s,
                    proceeding conference year by conference year, without probing the growing sectional and slavery
                    crises. He slides over 1844 entirely, without mentioning the traumatic division of the church, and
                    recounts Tarkington's traveling to conference in 1845 with Bishop L. L. Hamline and editor Charles
                    Elliott, both central actors in the crisis, without comment. All such discussion is postponed to the
                    next to last chapter, "A Preacher Faces Slavery and the Civil War," in which the
                    author ranges over the entire course of Methodist history. For a book that seemingly tries to hold
                    issues together, the isolation of this topic is strange and unfortunate. It is also unfortunate that
                    a rich and insightful volume is marred by relatively trivial problems.

               Journey to Hell: The Fiery Furnaces of Buchenwald. By J. Ray Clark. (Raleigh,
                    N.C.: Pentland Press, Inc., 1996. Pp. 168. Map, illustrations, appendices, bibliography, index.
                    $24.95.)
            
               Journey to Hell is a book for all who had a relative who served in the army in the
                    European theater during World War 11. It is a book about courage—the courage required to
                    engage in combat, to talk about it, and, finally, to write about it.
            No two soldiers fought the same war. What each endured is compared to and filtered through past
                    experiences, stored in imperfect memories, and recalled under varying circumstances. Many may label
                    others' stories as improbable or unbelievable and may conclude, "This never
                    happened." Why, then, would an old combat infantryman risk his reputation to tell his tale
                    of combat: simply because he feels it, like combat, must be done. Thousands of young men were
                    uprooted and forged into the 
                        United States
                     armed forces in World War II. These young men won the war. Their stories need to be
                    told.
            
               Journey to Hell is the story of one young Hoosier taken from his home and in a few
                    months transformed into an infantryman. J. Ray Clark vividly describes infantry basic training, and
                    readers will sense the cocky optimism of the young men who left camp for Europe. In George S.
                    Patton's 3rd Army, Clark fought as a rifleman, carried a thirty-eight-pound radio, and manned a
                    bazooka in the 80th Infantry Division in 
                  France, Germany
               , and 
                        Austria
                    . He and his buddies soon discovered that they did not really know how to survive in
                    combat. They made mistakes, and the survivors learned from them. Friends were killed, and the rest
                    fought on. Clark found that the less he knew about a replacement soldier the easier it was to accept
                    his eventual loss.
            Later, as hardened combat veterans, Clark and others were unprepared for the horrors of the
                    Buchenwald concentration camp. Clark titled his book Journey to Hell because, for
                    him, this camp was perhaps the culminating hell of his war experiences. He saw, could not
                    comprehend, then was ordered to move on. But the horror of the few hours he spent at Buchenwald has
                    haunted him for over fifty years.
            Clark's story could have been written by any of thousands who fought alongside him. Some could not
                    write because they died; others lacked the ability to write; fewer still had the courage to put
                    their memories on paper. All infantrymen should be proud of Clark's story for it evidences the
                    courage of them all.

                        Detroit
                     mayor Edward L. Jeffries and his friends exchanged in the course of World War II. The
                    project promises to reveal much about the city that has been a cauldron of economic and social
                    change throughout the twentieth century. Jeffries was first elected mayor in 1939 shortly after the
                    city was swept by an unprecedented working class insurgency. He presided over 
                        Detroit
                     as it became the nation's center of war production and as it was racked by brutal, at
                    times bloody, racial conflict. And he left office in 1947, just as the city was beginning to undergo
                    a complex, and ultimately devastating, economic restructuring. Surely, in conversation with his most
                    intimate associates, Jeffries would have much to say about his struggles to govern amid such
                    profound transformations.
            Capeci portrays Jeffries and his friends—mostly newspapermen then serving in the armed
                    forces—as exemplars of civic duty and personal loyalty. Jefies's circle, Capeci writes in
                    his introduction, shared a "Periclean" concept of governance, committing
                    themselves to "independent leadership" in service to the entire community. Their
                    shared vision pushed them beyond professional association into personal commitment, binding them as
                    comrades who cared about, indeed loved, one another. This portrayal is moving but not convincing.
                    For the most part Jeffries's letters are simply chatty, full of city hall gossip, local political
                    news, and reports of the mayor's golf and card games. Jeffries's friends respond in kind, at least
                    until June, 1944, offering detailed, gently humorous descriptions of training camp routines and
                    military snafus. The exchanges can make for sprightly reading, and it is easy to see how they
                    sustained friendships; but they are hardly the stuff of Periclean virtue.
            Capeci's framework becomes even more problematic when it is placed alongside the larger story of
                    Jeffries's mayoralty. Facing progressive opponents in the 1943 and 1945 mayoral campaigns, Jeffries
                    ruthlessly played the race card, trading on the white hatred of African Americans that in the summer
                    of 1943 had caused two days of rioting and had left thirty-four Detroiters dead. Jeffries's letters
                    brush lightly over the race issue even in the riot's immediate aftermath. But there is no reason for
                    Capeci, who has written two important monographs on 
                        Detroit
                    's wartime race relations, to do likewise. In fact, Capeci needed to do the opposite, to
                    fill the silences of the letters either with his own commentary or with supplementary documents
                    drawn from newspaper stones, campaign speeches, or similar sources. For it is in the letters'
                    silences—in the problems left unaddressed, the injustices untreated—that
                    Jeffries most clearly  expresses himself. He was, as Capeci
                    suggests, a decent, even well intentioned man. But he dreamed no great dreams for his city or for
                    himself. He was, simply, a local politician who loved the camaraderie and competition of city hall
                    and who was willing to call on the most dangerous of impulses to maintain his place in that world.

            Indiana-born Ernie Pyle brought World War II home to the American people. His dispatches captured the
                    life and death of the G.I. from North Africa to the Pacific. Besides being America's most famous war
                    correspondent, Pyle was also one of the nation's most admired citizens. When he was killed by a
                    sniper's bullet on a Pacific island in April, 1945, his passing was compared to the death of
                    President Franklin D. Roosevelt, which had occurred a few days before.
            While newsreels showed battles and invasions, and while Edward R. Murrow brought to America the
                    sounds of the bombs falling over 
                        London
                    , Pyle gave America a straightforward yet emotional account of G.I. Joe and his war. To
                    tell the soldiers' heroic tales, Pyle squatted in their foxholes, ate their K rations, and saw them
                    die. If he held back a little about the more horrible aspects of war, it was because he felt that
                    their families could take just so much. The troops loved Ernie and considered him one of their own;
                    even the generals said there was no finer soldier than Pyle and that by his stories he even aided
                    the war effort.
            Born on a farm near Dana, Indiana, in 1900, Pyle hated farming. In order to escape that confining
                    life he enrolled at Indiana University in 1919. Although he majored in economics, it was journalism
                    that held his attention. Soon he worked his way up to become editor of the Indiana University Daily Student. Before he graduated, Pyle left the university to work briefly as a
                    reporter on the 
                        La Porte
                    , Indiana, Herald and then moved on to a job on a 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., paper.
            Pyle began writing a successful column on aviation and then was made a roving reporter to write about
                    life in America. In his stories one can detect the development of his style—his
                    succinctness, the choice of the right word, and his ability to explain Americans to themselves. He
                    was able to identify with the people about whom he wrote. He became an American Everyman, who
                    described common men doing uncommon deeds.
            
            As Pyle captured the pain and suffering of Depression America, he was suffering from a marriage that
                    was failing, doubts about himself, and constant ailments. Thus for Pyle the war was both a new
                    challenge and an escape. From 1942 until his death three years later, his columns became one of the
                    most important links between the home front and the boys overseas. As he had earlier in describing
                    the brave mail pilots and the frightened farmers of Indiana, Pyle wrote about the G.I. with
                    understanding and compassion. Similarly James Tobin in Ernie Pyle's War writes
                    with feeling and comprehension on this fascinating subject. A prizewinning reporter himself, Tobin
                    began his research on Pyle over a decade ago while writing a dissertation on World War II.
            By reading this useful, scholarly book along with some dispatches from Pyle's book Brave
                        Men, one will have a better understandmg of World War II and the G.I.'s who won it.

            Drat that Ken Burns. Ever since his series, American Civil War publications, always more prolix and
                    profitable than profound, have mushroomed exponentially. Gresham understood the likely results, and,
                    alas, this book is one more proof of his law.
            As the American Christ, Lincoln is the Great Icon, and this volume provides many familiar portraits
                    of him, along with cartoons, photographs of famous documents, and pictures of his friends, enemies,
                    assassins, and children, as well as several takes of the always unattractive Mary Todd Lincoln.
                    Interestingly enough, the earliest known photograph of Lincoln, included here, was taken in 1846,
                    and the next came in 1857. One therefore never sees the youthful man, although the full gallery of
                    images from the last eight years of his life is, of course, a fair representation of Lincoln's
                    meteoric rise to fame.
            Many of Lincoln's portraits show the ravages of depression. Indeed he was at times quite gaunt, an
                    indication, perhaps, that during his deeper bouts of what he called the "hypo,"
                    and described as a helpless, desperate condition, he could not eat. None of Lincoln's countervailing
                    humor shines through the photographs, for which Lincoln, in common with all sitters of his day, were
                    trained to sit motionless and be solemn.
            
            Cecil K. Byrd and Ward W. Moore do not discuss states of mind or cultural styles of presentation of
                    self, nor do they analyze the photographers whose work they reproduce, nor the technology of their
                    medium. Instead they present a potted biography of Lincoln in pictures and captions that repeats
                    what readers are likely to know while omitting discussion of new ways of looking at history through
                    photographs, an approach quite well developed by now in the wider historical profession. In this
                    unannotated volume the editors cite none of the work being done in the cultural history written
                    about such images. With considerable innocence they use photographs of monuments designed well after
                    Lincoln's death to depict the historical Lincoln, especially during his youthful, unphotographed
                    years. Although they might have discussed such monuments as an historical genre in themselves, they
                    tend to take artists' imagined images of the young Lincoln as the equivalent of documents, which
                    they are not.
            Neither is the book handsome. The cover is most unattractive and the layout pedestrian, facts that
                    make this book, if inexpensive, not really suitable for the coffee table. In themselves some of the
                    photographs, especially of rarely seen minor characters, are quite fascinating, and Lincoln's visage
                    is always riveting. This reviewer can never decide if he was truly ugly or deeply handsome, but in
                    either event one can see in his face the ravages his office and the war brought him. Some physicians
                    have also seen in these photographs the effects of Marfan Syndrome, which might have brought him to
                    a premature death had John Wilkes Booth missed his mark.
            For a fuller pictorial depiction of Lincoln one should consult Lincoln in
                    Photographs (1963) by Charles 
                        Hamilton
                     and Lloyd Ostendorf. For an inexpensive place to begin, however, this volume fits the
                    bill.

            This slender volume of essays constitutes a festschrift to honor a respected and
                    admired teacher, Richard H. Sewell of the Department of History at the University of
                            
                  Wisconsin, Madison
               . The seven authors, all leading scholars of
                    mid-nineteenth-century America and all students mentored by Sewell at 
                        Madison
                    , stand as testimony to his strong pedagogy. The essays themselves are a fine tribute to
                    their teacher.
            
            All seven essays point to the centrality of race in 
                        United States
                     history. The authors have employed a variety of historical techniques to illustrate the
                    problems that slavery and its adherents produced for this country, problems that have yet to be
                    resolved. From traditional political and diplomatic studies to examination of popular song texts to
                    intellectual history, each author demonstrates how disputes over race and slavery have shaped
                    American politics and society.
            Robert E. May of Purdue University illustrates convincingly that Republican and abolitionist
                    criticisms of antebellum presidents' actions against filibusters in the 1840s and 1850s lacked
                    substance. Official policy toward the filibusters was clearly aimed at stopping the expeditions and
                    invasions of Caribbean and Central American states; unofficial policy was often less coherent. These
                    antebellum presidents, however, consistently took steps to stop the adventurers. That they were
                    often unsuccessful demonstrates the inability of governments in the era to halt enterprising
                    adventurers. Richard J. McManus's essay on states rights doctrine in Republican party politics in 
                        Wisconsin
                     in the 1850s serves as a corrective to common views of states rights as strictly a
                    southern phenomenon to legitimize slavery. In 
                        Wisconsin
                     states rights was employed by Republicans to fight the federal government's acceptance
                    of slavery. Peter Knupfer's study of the often forgotten Constitutional Union party of 1860
                    highlights generational politics and conflict both within the party and against the sectionalism
                    fostered in the Republican Democratic party duel.
            Louis S. Gerteis's essay on blackface minstrelsy in antebellum America is perhaps the most ambitious
                    of the collection. Unfortunately, his analysis of the role and meaning of the art form is
                    unsuccessful, owing in no small part to his weak attempt to match early-nineteenth-century social
                    Darwinism to a facile reading of the texts of popular songs sung in American theaters. Ira Berlin's
                    strong essay on who freed the slaves brings the reader back onto firmer ground with his conclusion
                    supporting the view that slaves and black soldiers took the lead in emancipation during the Civil
                    War. Brooks D. Simpson shows General Ulysses S. Grant to have been sympathetic to the circumstances
                    of black soldiers who fought for freedom in the war and appreciative of the soldiers' predicament
                    during their occupation duty in the Reconstruction-era South. David W. Blight's excellent essay on
                    race and the memory of the Civil War shows the price paid for forgetting the origins of the
                    rebellion and wallowing in a mythological past built on white supremacy and white nationalism.

            Civil War historians have been blessed in the past ten years with the publication of numerous
                    diaries, letters, and reminiscences penned by Union and Confederate enlisted men or company
                    officers. Now added to this collection is Sergeant Ambrose Remley's letters and
                    "memorandum," published by the 
                        Montgomery County
                     Historical Society, 
                        Crawfordsville
                    , Indiana. Remley served throughout the war in Company E, 72nd Indiana Volunteer
                    Infantry, a regiment that formed part of Colonel John Thomas Wilder's legendary "Lightning
                    Brigade." Armed with 
                        Spencer
                     repeating rifles and serving as mounted infantry, Wilder's men became famous for
                    seizing strategic Hoover's Gap during the Tullahoma Campaign of 1863 and making a tenacious stand
                    when part of the Union Army of the Cumberland was routed at the Battle of Chickamauga the same year.
                    The 72nd Indiana also participated in the 
                        Atlanta
                     Campaign and, after Wilder resigned, General James Wilson's cavalry raid to capture
                    Selma, 
                        Alabama
                    , and Macon, 
                        Georgia
                    . The brigade was thus one of the most singular and, until recently, most unrecognized
                    organizations in the Union Army.
            Remley's letters and memorandum contain useful information for anyone studying the life of the common
                    soldier in the Union's western armies. Remley often commented on his health, rations, and officers
                    and on the battles and skirmishes in which he participated, the activities at home, and the living
                    conditions in camp and on the march. He was obviously anxious to keep those in Indiana informed of
                    the regiment's service and the ways in which the men from 
                        Montgomery County
                     were coping with life "at the front." For the most part his writings
                    make interesting reading, especially if a student of the period has not delved into many published
                    "common soldier" letter collections from the Midwest.
            Unfortunately, some of the letters contain simply a brief recounting of Remley's activities without
                    extraordinary detail regarding the activities of his regiment or the Lightning Brigade. A reader
                    expecting extensive information and anecdotes about the fight at Hoover's Gap or the Battle of
                    Chickamauga, the operations of the brigade, or other aspects of its unusual service as mounted
                    infantry will lament that Remley wrote so sparingly.
            The notes and explanatory text by Dale Edward Linvill are largely adequate and accurate but do
                    contain a few spelling and factual errors. For instance, a photograph of Remley's postwar Grand Army
                    of the Republic canteen (p. 62) is instead identified as the one  he carried during his service. To Linvill's credit, however, two very helpful sections are
                    included in the work, namely, Remley's biography and a family genealogy, which enable the reader to
                    follow Remley's civilian life and trace the persons referred to in his writings. The maps included
                    in the book were taken from the atlas accompanying the Official Records, and while
                    some are clearly reproduced, others are not so readable.
            Overall, the 
                        Montgomery County
                     Historical Society should be commended for publishing this work. It is a solid
                    collection of Civil War material by an articulate Hoosier soldier, and although Remley did not
                    provide all the details one might hope for, any accounts by a member of Wilder's Brigade are
                    certainly worth reading.

               An Army of Women: Gender and Politics in Gilded Age 
                            Kansas
                        . By Michael Lewis Goldberg. (

                    sources, index. $39.95.)
            After providing a brief historical perspective contrasting myths with the realities of 
                        Kansas
                     communities during the Gilded Age, Michael Lewis Goldberg analyzes the importance of
                    gender as it affected political and social circles. Initially the author focuses on the rise of the
                    Woman Movement in 
                        Kansas
                    , but later he broadens his scope to include the connections of the Woman Movement with
                    other groups such as the Farmers' Alliance and the Populist party, which shared an interest in
                    women's rights. Considerable attention is given to strategies employed by these groups to influence
                    the ruling Republican leaders and in some cases also the Democrats.
            The Woman Movement in 
                        Kansas
                     provided a political platform for urban, Anglo, middle-class women. Members of the
                    movement intended to infuse the major political parties with respectable values, to banish chicanery
                    and patronage, and to attack voter apathy and ignorance. Two organizations, the Women's Christian
                    Temperance Union (WCTU) and 
                        Kansas
                     Equal Suffrage Association (KESA) made up the major components of the movement. The
                    author compares and contrasts the membership of these organizations. A particularly interesting part
                    of the analysis deals with the context in which many members held nativist, racist, and classist
                    beliefs that shaped the formation of their ideology and affected the selection of political
                    strategies and tactics. The author explains how these narrow views made outreach to other
                    constituencies such as rural women and black women difficult and often led to innovative strategies
                    that allowed members to retain their views and still support the cause.
            
            Organizers for the Farmers' Alliance had to convince isolated, rural people that they should have an
                    effective political voice. Here again the intent was to improve the tone of the contemporary
                    political scene. The alliance ideally encouraged women to exercise an equal political voice, but
                    leadership rhetoric sometimes undermined this support. Nevertheless, strategies were devised to
                    encourage the participation of rural women. For example, instead of the Woman Movement's
                    conventional confinement to the parlor, the alliance used gender-inclusive spaces to create
                    family-based political communities. Schoolhouses, picnic groves, and other community gathering
                    places provided spaces hospitable to both women and men.
            The Woman Movement, the Farmers' Alliance, and affiliated groups all had to come to grips with the
                    dilemma of partisan politics. Ideologically, they preferred to remain nonpartisan, but in practice
                    these groups had to figure out how to wield power by influencing those in control of political
                    parties. In 
                        Kansas
                     this meant coming to terms in some measure with the Republican leaders. The author
                    provides insight into the complicated political negotiations at local and state levels.
            The influence of a number of national figures such as Carrie Chapman Catt and Susan B. Anthony is
                    mentioned, but a major contribution of this work lies in the inclusion of less well known figures
                    such as Fanny Rastall and Laura Johns, whose efforts to organize and confront the entrenched
                    political machines were exceptional. These detailed descriptions of political confrontation at the
                    local and state level add an important dimension to the understanding of political change during the
                    pursuit of women's rights.
            This work by including gender as a primary variable has provided a provocative and more realistic
                    analysis of political intrigue during the Gilded Age.

                        Missouri
                    's political history offers a variety of types, from the corrupt to the pure. Joseph W.
                    Folk occupied a position near the latter end of that spectrum. Many of his contemporaries, including
                    Lincoln Steffens and William Allen White, saw him in that way; so have later scholars, from Thomas
                    S. Barclay, the author of the Dictionary of American Biography sketch in 1931, to
                    Louis Geiger, who published the first substantial biography (Joseph W. Folk of 
                            Missouri
                        
               ) in 1953, to the leading historians of Folk's time in 
                        Missouri
                    : David  Thelen (Paths of Resistance:
                        Tradition and Modernization in Industrializing 
                            Missouri
                        
               , 1986) and Lawrence O. Christensen and Gary R. Kremer (A History
                        Of 
                            Missouri
                        
               , Volume N, 1875–1919, 1997). Now a new biographer
                    repeats that interpretation. It must be true.
            Some years ago Richard L. McCormick, writing in the American Historical Review
                    (April, 1981), proposed that "The Discovery that Business Corrupts Politics" had
                    much to do with the emergence of Progressivism, and Steven L. Piott's biography lends weight to that
                    hypothesis. Folk discovered corruption and became a Progressive. He did so when the moral values he
                    had acquired growing up in a Baptist and prosperous family in small-town 
                        Tennessee
                     clashed with what he saw in the big and dynamic city (
                        St. Louis
                    ) to which, as a young man of twenty-four, he had moved in 1893, hoping for success as a
                    lawyer. Elected as the city's circuit attorney in 1900, he prosecuted for election fraud and bribery
                    a political boss, Edward 
                        Butler
                    , and other individuals from the closely linked realms of business and politics. What
                    Folk learned, Piott writes, "was that big business corrupted politics by bribing
                    politicians; that municipal government was conducted for the interests of private business and not
                    for the common good; and that corruption in municipal government was a problem of national
                    proportions that threatened the very existence of democratic government" (p. 61). Folk's
                    actions and the publicity they received, from Steffens among others, led to his election as governor
                    in 1904. In that office Folk stood for what he called the "
                        Missouri
                     Idea," which, according to the biographer, "necessitated the
                    unrelenting exposure and punishment of official grafters and the transformation of public office
                    into a public trust where elected officials would work for civic good and not for private
                    gain" (p. 73).
            Folk's battles made him nationally prominent and even a presidential possibility but did not move him
                    up the political ladder. Geiger offered an explanation. While regarding Folk as one of the state's
                    best governors who "did much for the cause of good government" and "was
                    never forgetful of his allegiance to the public he served," this biographer argued that
                    Folk did not have a "firm philosophy or body of principles around which to construct a
                    unified program of action." He lacked a "great theme of humanitarianism or social
                    justice to fire the hearts of man" (pp. 171-72). Piott challenges this appraisal, arguing
                    that Folk's "political vision" broadened during his governorship to include
                    "intensified opposition to special interests; greater direct, democratic participation in
                    the political process; and expanding the scope of government regulation" (p. 116).
                    Furthermore, the new biographer writes that Geiger and others "judge Folk more by what he
                    failed to do than by what he did and adopt a judgmental tone that suggests a criticism hardened by
                    modern-day cynicism" (p. 187). Piott's interpretation values highly Folks collaboration
                    with Steffens and the two men's efforts to reform the political process, and his explanation for the
                    Missourian's failure to rise higher in American politics 
                    stresses, in addition to his personality, opposition from the "pro-business
                    faction" in his party (p. 121).
            The book is a valuable addition to the literature on 
                        Missouri
                    's political history. Clearly written, it rests on a solid base composed mainly of
                    newspapers and the relevant scholarship, including Geiger's biography, Thelen's history, and Piott's
                    own study, The Anti-Monopoly Persuasion: Popular Resistance to the Rise of Big Business
                        in the Midwest (1985). Unfortunately, Folk's papers make no more than a small contribution.
                    Nevertheless, the book, part of the 
                        Missouri
                     Biography Series, illustrates a major theme in the history of Progressivism and
                    documents one end of 
                        Missouri
                    's political spectrum. Other volumes in the series, Robert H. Ferrell's Harry S. Truman: A Life (1994) and Lawrence H. Larsen and Nancy J. Hulston's Pendergast! (1997), focus on the center and the corrupt end.

                        : Visions of the 1904 World's Fair is part of a recent explosion of locally
                    produced picture books about this important event in 
                        St. Louis
                     and midwestern history. Timothy J. Fox and Duane R. Sneddeker use photographs from the 
                        Missouri
                     Historical Society's enormous photograph collection to illustrate the book.
            After a short introductory essay about the planning and preparation of Forest Park for the fair, the
                    authors organized the book into twenty-one chapters, each focusing on a particular venue or event.
                    Each chapter begins with a one-page introductory essay followed by eight to twenty pages of gorgeous
                    photographs. The final section of the book gives a paragraph or so of background on each of the
                    eight photographers responsible for the several hundred photographs presented in the book.

                is truly a picture book. Seventy percent (or more) of the pages are devoted to
                    showcasing photographs. These pictorial layouts are quite impressive. Unfortunately, no new
                    scholarly ground is broken here. In fact, this book is virtually devoid of cultural criticism. For
                    example, William J. McGee's (in)famous anthropology exhibit that ordered humans of different
                    ethnicities from "most civilized" to "least civilized" receives
                    only a few meager paragraphs. Those readers who are looking for a book that adds to  an understanding of the fair's impact on 
                        St. Louis
                     or the goals of fair planners themselves should look elsewhere (to works such as Robert
                    W. Rydell's All the World's A Fair, 1984).
            Although the authors make clear in the acknowledgments that they had limited goals, discussion of a
                    number of relevant topics would have improved the book. What, for example, did the fair's organizers
                    hope the celebration would do for 
                        St. Louis
                    ? How did the fair's theme of "industrial progress" compare with
                    themes of other civic events in 
                        St. Louis
                     history? Furthermore, the theme was remarkably similar to themes of both the Veiled
                    Prophet parades of the late nineteenth century and the 
                        St. Louis
                     Pageant and Masque of 1914. Veiled Prophet organization members, fair planners, and
                    pageant organizers usually came from the same segment of 
                        St. Louis
                     society and believed these events provided important chances to engage in civic
                    instruction of the population. Some sort of attempt to place the themes of the World's Fair in
                    context with those of other civic events would have added to an understanding of the fair's place in 
                        St. Louis
                     history and does not seem outside the scope of the book.
            The World's Fair of 1904 is often looked upon by St. Louisans nostalgically as the high point of 
                        St. Louis
                    's history and place in the world. While this beautiful book succeeds in showcasing the

               Researching Western History: Topics in the Twentieth Century. Edited by Gerald
                    D. Nash and Richard W. Etulain. ([Albuquerque]: University of 
                        New Mexico

            This book, edited by two well-known figures in twentieth century western history, consists of an
                    introduction by Earl Pomeroy and eight essays on various topics. The topics include economic
                    history, natural resources and the environment, urban development, politics, women, cultural
                    history, and the myth of the West. The final chapter by Gene M. Gressley attempts to reach
                    conclusions about the previous essays and to provide some overarching ideas and possibilities for
                    the future course of western history. The central purpose of the book is to encourage new research
                    and to suggest possible topics that merit scholarly investigation.
            Are there significant themes that emerge from the eight essays? One such theme seems to be the
                    unevenness of previous coverage of  topics. While some subjects
                    have been researched adequately, several writers point out that others have received little or no
                    attention. A related criticism is that western historians have too often failed to relate their
                    studies to the national and global scenes. This weakness, as Gressley particularly stresses, is a
                    serious flaw because recent western events have increasingly been connected to overseas trends and
                    developments. Some of the writers seem to concentrate too much on what has been done in the field
                    and provide too few suggestions as to what needs to be done. Gerald D. Nash's essay on economic
                    history and Glenda Riley's chapter on western women, however, both display a complete mastery of
                    their subjects and contain excellent proposals for future research.
            Although none of the writers are identified strongly with the New Western History, passages devoted
                    to the environment, minorities, women, urban development, the western myth, and cultural
                    developments reveal the influence of that school. In line with the New Western History, the field
                    has greatly broadened in terms of the topics now covered and in a tendency to expand focus into the
                    twentieth century.
            Books such as this are not always enjoyable reading, but they are extremely important. The essays in
                    the present study allow readers to gauge recent trends in twentieth-century western history and to
                    see some of the possibilities for additional research opportunities.

               Peasant Maids—City Women: From the European Countryside to Urban
                    America. Edited by Christiane Harzig. (
                        Ithaca
                    , N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1997. Pp. xii, 344. Notes, maps, illustrations,
                    tables, index. Clothbound, $39.95; paperbound, $16.95.)
            
               Peasant Maids is the emigration story of single women from four villages or rural
                    communes in 
                  Germany, Poland,
                            Ireland
               , and Sweden to 
                        Chicago
                     in the late nineteenth century. The areas of origin in 
                        Germany
                     (Mecklenburg) and in Sweden (Dalsland) produced a relatively small slice of the
                    immigrant populations of 
                        Chicago
                     and may not be representative of those specific groups or their unmarried female
                    immigrants. Even so some of the behaviors of these newcomers in the Windy City appear to be typical.
                    The Polish and Irish samples, on the face of it, seem to be more representative of their
                    compatriots.
            Christiane Harzig's study of these four groups of single women contends that (1) single women
                    improved their lives and enjoyed  more personal freedom in 
                        Chicago
                     than in their homeland villages. (2) Immigrant women found a better marriage market in 
                        Chicago
                     where the immigrant male to female ratio was often two to one. Polish women whose main
                    goal was marriage went from being single to more than 80 percent married within four years of
                    arrival. (3) First-generation immigrant women married their own kind at the 95 percent-plus level.
                    (4) Single immigrant women seldom associated with Anglo-American women or those not from their
                    ethnolinguistic group. (5) Although Harzig writes in her introduction that "suffrage and
                    temperance had little attraction for ethnic women" (p. 18), she does not seem to consider
                    sufficiently the Swedish chapter, which shows (and other evidence not in this book confirms) that a
                    sizable body of Swedish immigrants, including many maids, were attracted to temperance societies,
                    temperance halls, temperance cafes, and similar places. (6) Divorce rates were low in both the
                    sending and receiving societies. (7) As Harzig states in her introduction, "Romantic love
                    had been an alien concept to peasant cultures but became more important in Chcago." Dowries
                    also became less common as the economic worth of single-women wage earners rose and because of the
                    favorable (for women) sex ratios. Although none of these findings is particularly novel or
                    noteworthy for immigration scholars, they are interestingly told in several chapters.
            The chapters dealing with the 
                        Chicago
                     experience of the Irish, Polish, and Swedish samples are the strongest in the book. By
                    comparison the German chapter is disappointing for the shallowness of its research and for its
                    slender gender content—only six of the thirty-seven pages deal with women.
            In sharp contrast is the story of the Irish, which is much more detailed and better contextualized.
                    Deirdre Mageean highlights the occupational changes occurring among Irish-American women. The first
                    generation worked primarily as domestic servants, waitresses, and kitchen help. The second
                    generation was the beneficiary of upward mobility through education. The vital role of the Catholic
                    schools and training institutions in educating single Irish women as teachers and nurses, Mageean
                    points out, produced a white collar and professional class that nearly doubled that of their Irish
                    male counterparts—8.5 to 4 percent for professionals and 25 to 16 percent for white
                    collars on the job by 1900. This chapter also chronicles the disproportionately large role of
                    Irish-American female union organizers and leaders, including the head of the 
                        Chicago
                     Teachers Union, a "Petticoat Butcher" who led strikes in the
                    stockyards, and of course the famous Mother Jones. Partly as an explanation of why the Irish female
                    immigrants broke with old world conservativism, Mageean adds, "Unlike Polish and German
                    Catholicism, the Irish religious were not transmitters of ethnic identity; indeed parishes
                    accelerated the assimilation of Irish immigrants into American life" (p. 259).
            
            Also interesting is Maria Anna Knothe's study of Polish women from a village in Austrian 
                        Poland
                    . Knothe shows how the 
                        Chicago
                     marriage market for Polish singles "cured" the illegitimacy problem
                    (small as it was at this time). Knothe writes that since men outnumbered women in 
                        Chicago
                    's Polonia "even a poor, not particularly pretty woman could easily find a
                    husband" (pp. 314 15). Whereas many writers have argued that urbanization of rural people
                    disrupted family patterns and caused high rates of bastardy in big cities, Knothe's evidence shows
                    just the opposite for Polish 
                        Chicago
                    . Between 1894 and 1902 when the illegitimacy rate was 7.5 percent for all births in 
                        Poland
                    , in 
                        Chicago
                     it shrank to less than 1 percent (0.9) for 
                        Chicago
                    's Polish section. Lopsided sex ratios in favor of women turned the tide. The findings
                    of this small case sample casts some doubt on the widely held belief that cities cause urban
                    pathologies.
            The Swedish maids chapter by Margareta Matovic points out how Svenska Flickas in 
                        Chicago
                     were much more independent minded than their Baltic counterparts from 
                        Poland
                     and North 
                        Germany
                     and more like the Irish. Lacking the English language fluency of their Hibernian
                    counterparts, they gravitated toward domestic labor. "Being a live-in servant in a
                    millionaire's home was the top of the career ladder," Matovic writes (p. 296). Some
                    housemaids in middle-and upper-income homes were treated very well: they sometimes had their own
                    rooms and private baths and shared in much of their employer's way of life. "It was a
                    blessing for a girl like me to come to such a home," wrote one Swedish maid (p. 291).
                    Living at the top end of the social register made some of them picky about their marriage partners
                    and reluctant to marry young working-class Swedish lads for fear of falling back into a lower class
                    life. In any event the parallels between the independence of the Irish second generation as
                    expressed by the upward mobility and the Swedish maids who married later or sometimes not at all is
                    an interesting similarity.
            Editor Harzig seems genuinely puzzled by the stories that she has edited and writes, "In
                    surveying the effects of migration and urbanization on women of four ethnic groups, we discern no
                    neat pattern but a tangled skein" (p. 17). Nonetheless, this book is an interesting
                    collection that enriches knowledge of the immigrant experience and underscores how homeland
                    traditions did, and sometimes did not, shape the behaviors of newcomers to 
                        Chicago
                    .

               Civic Wars: Democracy and Public Life in the American City during the Nineteenth
                        Century. By Mary P. Ryan. (Berkeley: University of

            At the end of the twentieth century numerous social commentators have criticized Americans for their
                    retreat from public spaces and expressions of public solidarity. Suburban "gated
                    communities" spatially reflect this sense of isolation, and politics of exclusion and
                    divisiveness do so socially. Before rushing to judgment, however, these social commentators should
                    first read Mary P. Ryan's fascinating new book on public life in the nineteenth-century city. In so
                    doing they would learn that social and political isolationism is far from recent; for more than a
                    century Americans have steadily removed themselves from the public arena and into more homogenous
                    social groupings and spatial settings.
            Concentrating on three representative cities—
                  New
                            York, San Francisco
               , and 
                        New Orleans
                    —Ryan presents this argument by tracing the evolution of public life in the
                    mid-nineteenth century. She sees three distinct phases in this evolution. First is the period 1825
                    to 1850, in which Ryan finds public life and democracy in its fullest (relative to the other two
                    periods) expression. In this period political, economic, racial, and gender debates were carried on
                    (generally) peacefully in public spaces—open markets and squares, public buildings, and,
                    most important for Ryan, on the streets during parades. In the second section Ryan turns to what she
                    calls the "interregnum," the period 1850 to 1865. Here, Ryan argues that the Civil
                    War was actually the conclusion of a longer history of "civic wars" fought in
                    American cities during the 1850s. As issues of race and ethnicity dominated American cities, earlier
                    peaceful methods for debate began to be replaced by violence, vigilantism, and militarism. In the
                    final section Ryan shows how public life had moved far from its original meaning, as class identity
                    and social isolation replaced earlier, more inclusive displays of the "public."
            Ryan's analysis is compelling and draws on a range of historical source material. She also writes
                    clearly and is not averse to throwing in occasional editorial comments. If her analysis lacks
                    anything, it would be in the absence of a critical examination of religion as a social variable.
                    Throughout the book Ryan treats religion as a byproduct of ethnicity—Irish Catholics
                    against the Anglo-Protestants, for example—rather than as its own phenomenon with
                    distinct sources of tension. Similarly, an analysis of the black church would have enhanced the
                    discussions of black-white racial tension. Given the black church's role in modem civil rights
                    battles and as the "public face" of the African-American community, it surely
                    played an important part in nineteenth-century racial politics. The other quibble concerns the
                    absence of maps. So much of the book—the central theme,  in fact—treats "urban space," yet apart
                    from a few early street maps, the book lacks any geographic signposts. In several instances, for
                    example, when Ryan describes a Fourth of July parade route or a neighborhood's social composition, a
                    map would have enabled this reader to "locate" the goings-on more easily.
            Although the book does not discuss Indiana or its cities, local readers will nevertheless find much
                    value in Ryan's enjoyable and informative work that should contribute to the continuing social
                    analysis of public life in the coming years.

            Beautifully designed and printed, lucidly written, this little book covers the usual ground. It
                    relates the White House meeting of the joint chiefs of staff with President Harry S. Truman on June
                    18, 1945, in which the decision was taken to invade the southernmost Japanese home island, Kyushu,
                    on November 1, 1945, with invasion of Honshu, the Tokyo plain, scheduled for April 1, 1946. After
                    the test of the plutonium bomb on July 16 (a warning went out from the Potsdam Conference on July
                    26, which the Japanese government spurned), the bombings on August 6 and 9 ended the war on August
                    14. One of the best things about this book is the author's willingness to say that it was the second
                    bomb, not Russian entry into the war the preceding day, that persuaded the Japanese military to go
                    along with the civil members of the cabinet and surrender.
            Unfortunately, the author, a historian in the Nuclear Regulatory Agency, is not as evenhanded as he
                    seems, and the unhappy debate among historians and political scientists over use of nuclear weapons
                    on Hiroshima and Nagasaki will go on—with sides taken frequently out of emotion,
                    ignorance, or memory of the Cold War (Gar Alperovitz opened the debate in 1965 with his book
                    contending that the 
                        United States
                     dropped the bombs not to end World War II but to impress the Russians). The first
                    evidence of J. Samuel Walker's point of view is his use of the word "myth" to
                    describe the argument that President Truman did not face a stark choice between invasion of the
                    Japanese home islands and use of the bombs. A second appears in his assertion that scholars agreed
                    in deploring cancellation of the proposed text for an exhibit at the Air and Space Museum in 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., displaying the nose of the Enola Gay and showing 
                        Japan
                    
                     defending itself against American imperialism. The book says
                    little, almost nothing, about possible casualties on Kyushu, implying that such discussion would be
                    (to use a recent academic word) counterfactual: the invasion never happened. The truth is that
                    Japanese force levels on Kyushu rose rapidly after the White House meeting on June 18, from an
                    estimated 350,000 to 900,000. The figure for estimated casualties offhandedly mentioned by General
                    George C. Marshall at the meeting, 31,000 (deaths would have been one out of three or four) became
                    irrelevant. The one million figure for casualties in the invasion of 
                        Japan
                     mentioned after the war by former secretary of war Henry L. Stimson and by President
                    Truman was far from unbelievable. In an astonishing assertion, Walker says that scholars now are
                    united in believing the bombs unnecessary. He does not say that the half-dozen books published on
                    the fiftieth anniversary of Hiroshima divided evenly, pro and con. One of the three
                    "pro" books maintained that an invasion of Kyushu could easily have cost 150,000 
                        United States
                     deaths. This figure did not include the 100,000 Allied captives in 
                        Japan
                    ; the Japanese vice-minister of war already had issued the order for their deaths, by
                    any available means, when the first American soldier set foot on Kyushu. Nor did it include
                    casualties possible in the invasion of Honshu, to follow Kyushu. What was Marshall to do when faced
                    with such a holocaust? Until the end of his life in 1959 he insisted that the bombs were necessary.
                    So did Truman.

                    his service with General William T. Sherman from the spring of 1864 to May, 1865. More than a story
                    of the Civil War, this volume chronicles the growth of a twenty-one-year-old private into a
                    twenty-four-year-old major during a bloody war. From an ingenuous, idealistic, ambitious recruit
                    Wills matured into a war-weary officer who was a keen observer of his world. After helping to repel
                    an attack by the 
                        Georgia
                     militia in November, 1864, he described the dead and dying as "old grey-haired
                    and weakly-looking men and little boys, not over 15 years old… I hope we will never have
                    to shoot at such men again. They knew nothing at all about fighting…." Wills
                    entered the war to save the Union; his early comments about slaves "lacked sympathy, even
                    decency" (p. ix). Even his eventual acceptance of emancipation and black soldiers probably
                    resulted from the increased opportunities for white officers to command black regiments.
                    Nonetheless, he was bothered by the anomalies of the slave society. Unlike many of his
                    contemporaries whose Civil War experiences have been published, Wills was a witty, talented writer.
                    His letters and diary are not only highly informative but fascinating as well. Described as a
                    "neglected classic" (p. vii) and "one of the finest collections of Civil
                    War letters ever published" (Peter Cozzens, The Terrible Sound, 1992),
                    this volume certainly merited reprinting. Lorna Lutes Sylvester, Indiana University,

                    , IN 47448.) In 1892 J. H. Strasser, a newspaper editor in New Ulm, 
                        Minnesota
                    , published a history of his town. New Ulm had been settled by Germans in the 1850s and
                    forty years later still proudly retained its ethnic identity. Strasser and other contributors told
                    of  the devastations wrought by the Sioux uprising of 1862 and
                    by natural disasters such as locust plagues and tornadoes; they also wrote glowingly of the schools,
                    industries, businesses, and general prosperity of their town. Strasser portrayed New Ulm as a
                    shining example of "German enterprise, German steadiness, and German success" with
                    "amazing" growth, "outstanding" new buildings, and
                    "hardworking, decent, easygoing, honest" citizens (p. 22). As a fine example of
                    late nineteenth-century civic boosterism with a strong ethnic element, this document should be of
                    considerable interest to scholars of nineteenth-century immigration and ethnicity. Dawn

                    relatively little published information about the western communities. Sites, and the remainders of
                    sites, are scattered through 
                  Kentucky, Ohio
               , and Indiana, but less than a handful are
                    well-known enough to attract much tourism. Boice and her coauthors seek to remedy this situation
                    with a series of maps and essays on the major sites of western Shaker settlement. The essays
                    themselves, reflecting the book's multiple authorship, are of varying length and degree of detail.
                    As the title indicates, however, the detailed site maps will probably be of primary interest, both
                    to historians and tourists. Dawn Bakken, Indiana University,
