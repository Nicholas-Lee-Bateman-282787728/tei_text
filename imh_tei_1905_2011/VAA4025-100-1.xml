            <head>EDITOR'S NOTE</head>
            <p>Studying history connects us to our past.</p>
            <p>Such was the thinking that led to the creation of this magazine ninety–nine years ago.
                    Editor George Cottman and his contributors believed themselves engaged in a vital battle against
                    forgetfulness and aimless change—a battle to rescue obscure documents and preserve fading
                    memories. Around them industry, large–scale agriculture, urbanization, and a growing
                    population of immigrants threatened the rural and small–town Indiana that they and other
                    longtime Hoosiers recalled. With their artistic and literary contemporaries, the new generation of
                    Indiana historians crafted a picture of a bygone place of self–sufficient craftsmen and
                    farmers, of simple folk wisdom, and shared moral values.</p>
            <p>One of the ironies of studying history is that it opens our eyes to the inconsistency of the record
                    of the past—a record that is for the most part one of change and disagreement.
                    Things—to modify the old cliche—never were what they used to be. In the years
                    since our first issue in 1905, the changes that turn–of–the–century
                    Indianans lamented have themselves become the subject of historical analysis, even of sentimental
                    longing.</p>
            <p>The journal itself—established as a bulwark against the ravages of time— has
                    inevitably changed in the century since its first appearance. Our familiar red cover, introduced by
                    editor James Madison in 1987, nowjoins its predecessors (see facing page) as evidence of that steady
                    change. Beloved as was the previous design, we have chosen to honor the journal's pending
                    centennial by offering a new cover, reflecting our commitment to bring fresh perspectives to our
                    traditional mission. The new design, by Mary Blizzard of AB Graphics in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, draws on type and illustrations developed by Hoosier artist Gustave Baumann for James
                    Whitcomb Riley's All <hi rend="i">the Year Round</hi>, published in 1912. With its strong
                    sense of place and its focus on the passage of the seasons, Riley and Baumann's book seems
                    an apt source of inspiration for a journal dedicated to examining the effects of time upon
                    Indiana's culture.</p>
            <pb n="2" id="VAA4025-100-1-010"/>
            <p>For further thoughts on change, continuity, and the role of the <hi rend="i">1MH</hi>, you may wish
                    to visit Editorial Assistant Keith Erekson's analysis, in this issue, of last
                    year's reader survey. As Erekson shows, our readers did not shy from expressing their
                    vigorous (and often conflicting) opinions about the journal, its contents, and even the meaning of
                    "history" itself. Your survey comments, coupled with the high rate at which you
                    responded, help to confirm our feeling that this publication can and should remain vital for its
                    readers today—that our mission must not stop at only preserving evidence of the past. If
                    history is to connect us to the past, then it must also connect us to the same passion and
                    controversy that consumed George Cottman and his readers.</p>

            <head>Midwestern Quakers and the Struggle Against Slavery</head>
            <byline>THOMAS D. HAMM, APRIL BECKMAN, MARISSA FLORIO, KIRSTI GILES, AND MARIE HOPPER</byline>
            <p>In the writing of American history, Quakers have occupied a place out of proportion to their
                    relatively small numbers. Probably the most important reason for this conspicuous presence is the
                    group's pioneering work against slavery. Nearly every history of the antislavery movement
                    affirms the Quakers' precedence, both in Europe and America, in recognizing the evil of
                    human bondage and in speaking out against it. Typical is the verdict of Louis Filler, whose work set
                    the standard for a generation: "Although there were always individual voices opposing
                    slavery, the first group to take a stand on slavery had been the Quakers."
                    Filler's evaluation was echoed by Merton Dillon, who writes that Quakers "alone
                    grasped the dimensions of the problem." David Brion Davis, in his magisterial <hi rend="i">The Problem oj Slavery in Western Culture</hi>, reaches the same conclusion: "[W]hen

                    </placeName> racial attitudes. Anyone approaching the subject must confront the slow acceptance of
                    black members in the faith, a topic exhaustively treated by HenryJ. Cadbury in 1936. More recently,
                    Jean Soderlund argued in <hi rend="i">Quakers and Slavery: A Divided Spirit</hi> that the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> approach to slavery and African Americans generally was "gradualist,
                    segregationist, and paternalistic," and that it "set the tone for the white
                    antislavery movement in America" before 1833. A recent article by Ryan <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> makes a similar argument, as does a new work by Stephen Vincent on African Americans in

            </p>
            <p>Most of this work has focused on the East, especially <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the <geogName>Delaware Valley</geogName>. Our study moves the focus westward, to
                    the Indiana Yearly Meeting of Friends (both a regional unit and an annual convention), formed in
                    1821, and its offshoot bodies. This focus is appropriate for several reasons. By 1850, the Indiana
                    Yearly Meeting (Orthodox), the largest yearly meeting of Friends in the world, stretched from
                    central <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>. In short, before the Civil War, with the exception of badly fractured <placeName>

                    </placeName> groups in eastern <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the Indiana Yearly Meeting <hi rend="i">was</hi> midwestern Quakerism.</p>
            <p>Midwestern Quakers were not, however, a united body. In 1828, driven by theological controversies
                    among Friends in the East, they had split into Orthodox and Hicksite (reform) groups; thereafter
                    both called themselves Indiana Yearly Meeting, with the Orthodox embracing about 80 percent of those
                    who had been members before the split. Both yearly meetings, in turn, experienced division in the
                    1840s, when a group that called itself Indiana <list type="footnotes">

                    the larger Orthodox body upset by the refusal of the majority to support the radical abolitionist
                    movement. Hicksites experienced a similar schism, with their radical abolitionists separating to
                    form meetings of what became known as Congregational or Progressive Friends. Finally, because of
                    steady growth, in 1858 the Orthodox Indiana Yearly Meeting "set off," or
                    established, a new yearly meeting called Western, which included Orthodox Friends in <placeName>

            <p>These midwestern Friends lived amidst unrelenting racial prejudice. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787
                    had excluded slavery from the area, yet antislavery forces had to beat back strong efforts to
                    legalize forms of bondage in Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. All of the midwestern states imposed myriad schemes of racial discrimination,
                    culminating in Indiana's constitutional ban on the admission of people of color approved by
                    voters in 1851.Those who opposed such laws usually found themselves politically isolated. For
                    African Americans, freedom north of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> was definitely better than
                    slavery, but it was a limited, often degrading freedom.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>From its establishment in 1821, the Indiana Yearly Meeting had maintained a Committee on the Concerns
                    of the People of Color, sometimes called the African Committee. The committee's annual
                    reports are a fertile resource for understanding African–American life as Quakers saw it.

                                The lowest level of organization was the individual congregation, which Friends referred
                                to as a preparative meeting or simply as a meeting. One or more made up a monthly
                                meeting, the basic business unit for Friends. It received and disowned members, held
                                property, and solemnized marriages. Two or more monthly meetings made up a quarterly
                                meeting, which took up business that was considered beyond the purview of monthly
                                meetings. Several quarterly meetings made up the yearly meeting, the highest authority
                                for Friends. It had the last word in matters of faith and practice. See Thomas D. Hamm,

                    their impressions before 1870. Finally we have collections of Quaker family papers in various
                    repositories. One must be clear about the limitations of these resources, however. They reflect
                    African–American life as Quakers saw it. Only occasionally do we hear the voices of black
                    people themselves.</p>
            <p>The racial attitudes and practices of Friends in what was then the West differed significantly from
                    those of Friends back east. As organized bodies, midwestern Friends systematically and repeatedly
                    condemned racial prejudice. They did not segregate their schools, their meetinghouses, or their
                    graveyards. They opposed legal limits on African–American rights, such as the notorious
                    Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> black laws. They gave considerable time and effort to promoting black education and
                    relieving cases of poverty. They aided fugitive slaves, and gave time and money to rescue kidnapped
                    free people from slavery.</p>
            <p>Still, midwestern Friends had their limits. Some were not free from the racist attitudes of the
                    larger society. At least a few were colonizationists who could foresee an America free of slavery as
                    one that also must be free of black people (a view that some black leaders also embraced). Many
                    Friends were doubtless apathetic; a relatively small number conducted most of the meetings, and many
                    members were probably nominal in their commitments beyond attending worship. The quarterly meeting
                    committees on the concerns of the people of color often bewailed lack of interest. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> benevolence was frequently accompanied by a paternalistic outlook in which African
                    Americans had to be instructed in the virtues of thrift, hard work, and sobriety. But Friends
                    usually saw this need as growing not out of innate racial characteristics, but rather from the
                    ignorance and degradation of slavery.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>Even in light of these important qualifications, midwestern Quakers were remarkably consistent in

                    abolitionist" movement, and the Civil War and its aftermath. While Friends sometimes
                    responded to these events with new tactics (and sometimes differed over whether change was
                    appropriate), the underlying religious and moral foundations of their actions remained the same.</p>
            <p>To present–day minds, the most praiseworthy efforts of midwestern Friends were their
                    protests against legal disenfranchisement and discrimination. Friends protested black laws with some
                    regularity, and they opposed the exclusionary clauses of the new Indiana constitution in 1851. Like
                    most states in the antebellum period, North or South, Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> imposed severe disabilities on people of color. They could not vote, serve on juries or
                    in the militia, or testify in court against a white person. Neither state allowed black children to
                    attend public schools, nor did they provide separate schools before 1849, even though African
                    Americans paid school taxes. After 1831, both states required free blacks entering the state to post
                    bonds against becoming public charges, and in 1851 Hoosier voters approved by a
                    four–to–one margin a constitutional provision banning the entry of people of
                    color into the state.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Friends condemned these laws and urged their repeal. In 1831, for example, when the Indiana
                    legislature debated the law requiring free blacks entering the state to post a
                    five–hundred–dollar bond, Elijah Coffin, the clerk of the Orthodox yearly
                    meeting, strongly protested. As one state senator recorded: "He urged that the negro was a

                    Anti–Slavery Friends and the Hicksite–seceder Green Plain Yearly Meeting of
                    Congregational Friends took similar action. Bills for the repeal of the black laws were introduced
                    in the Indiana legislature by representatives from counties with large <placeName>

                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Waynesville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, wrote a public letter criticizing a Democratic state senate
                    candidate for his refusal to support repeal of the black laws, and in 1850 a member of the Miami
                    Quarterly Meeting (probably Evans) urged the amendment of the state constitution "that
                    there shall be no constitutional distinction on account of color." After the Civil War, in
                    the first such effort since the Hicksite separation, a joint committee from the Hicksite Indiana
                    Yearly Meeting and the Orthodox Indiana and Western yearly meetings attended the Indiana legislature
                    with a memorial urging it to repeal all discriminatory laws and to grant black men the right to

            <p>Indiana Friends reacted strongly to the 1851 Indiana constitution's ban of further black
                    immigration into the state, and its accompanying fund to encourage the colonization of
                    African–American residents. The Meeting for Sufferings of the Orthodox Indiana Yearly
                    Meeting, the equivalent of an executive committee, sent a long memorial to the state constitutional
                    convention decrying the proposal and invoking the Declaration of Independence to argue for legal
                    equality. The only concession that opponents gained, however, was a provision for a popular vote on
                    this clause separate from general approval or disapproval of the new constitution. The pattern of
                    voting on the exclusion provision also is revealing. Statewide, it passed with about 84 percent
                    approval. Only four counties rejected the clause. Of these, <placeName>

            <p>Even more revealing is a focus on the twenty Indiana counties that contained at least one monthly
                    meeting of Friends in 1851. We do not have any firm statistics on the number of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> men of voting age at this time, or even on the number of Quakers in Indiana, but it is
                    undoubtedly significant that in the twenty <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> counties, the margin of support for exclusion of African Americans was 66.5 percent as
                    opposed to 84 percent statewide. Of the four counties to cast more than 800 votes against the
                    proposal, three were the strongly <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>

                  <region type="county">Wayne</region>, <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
               </placeName>, and Henry. Another way of gauging the apparent impact of
                    Friends' votes is to consider that while the twenty <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> counties accounted for only 19.7 percent of the total votes cast on the provision, they
                    supplied 41 percent of the votes against it. To be sure, one should not assume that every
                    anti–exclusion vote in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> counties was cast by a Friend, or that all Friends voted against exclusion. Certainly
                    that must have been the case in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange County</region>
                    </placeName>, where only 24 votes were cast in opposition, and there were probably more than 24 <placeName>

                    </placeName> men of voting age there. But the conclusion is clear: levels of opposition were

            <p>The radical abolitionist offshoots of the two Indiana Yearly Meetings, the Indiana Yearly Meeting of
                    Anti–Slavery Friends and the Green Plain Yearly Meeting of Congregational Friends, were,
                    not surprisingly, even more outspoken in condemning legal manifestations of racism. In 1844, for
                    example, the Anti–Slavery Friends petitioned Congress not just for the abolition of

                            for possibly another 1,000 at most. Thus Friends could have accounted for about 5 percent of
                            the 135,000 votes cast on the proposal. For calculations of membership, see Richard Eugene

                    attention to black education after the separation of 1828, establishing a boarding school as well as
                    day schools. Hicksite Friends took a similar course. Friends of both persuasions reported great
                    satisfaction. For example, Hicksites recorded in 1832 the progress of pupils in two schools in <placeName>

            <p>West of the mountains the pattern is less clear. Black children were sometimes admitted to schools

            <p>The reason for the discrepancies is not apparent. No surviving document records the thoughts of
                    either Friends or African Americans on the subject. In some cases, such as the schools that Hicksite

                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> children, a practice often urged by influential Friends, may have played a role, since
                    almost no African Americans were Friends. In other cases, Friends may have deferred to the wishes of
                    black parents. Usually, Friends simply provided money to schools that African Americans controlled,
                    and black communities may have preferred this. They may also have found <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>

                    critical of the bodies from which they had seceded, suggested that the absence of

            <p>At least some Friends, when establishing schools that were not under the auspices of monthly or

                    white supremacy. Instead, he insisted that he was bound by the wishes of a majority of the
                    stockholders in the school, who were not Friends. Privately, he confided to Nicholson that he would
                    gladly have admitted <placeName>

                    have accepted her. If the Harveysburg case is typical, Friends were embarrassed to be accused of

            <p>In addition to their efforts to improve educational opportunities for black children, Friends also
                    helped impoverished blacks find employment, rescued freed blacks who had been kidnapped into slavery
                    and aided fugitive slaves traveling on the Underground Railroad. For example, in 1824 the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Garden</settlement>
                    </placeName> Quarterly Meeting in Indiana reported that it had "been attentive to the
                    situation of a number of Persons of Color, who have arrived from <placeName>

                    and procured wages for them." Similarly, when the Englishman Seebohm visited <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Parke County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1850, he found Friends there deliberating on how best to aid a party of

                    assistance, to promote their getting properly located, and finding the means of employment and
                    subsistence." Friends provided money to support impoverished blacks, and in other cases
                    paid doctor bills and defrayed funeral expenses. A particular concern was rescuing free people of
                    color who had been kidnapped and sold south as slaves. The Orthodox Indiana Yearly Meeting dealt
                    with a number of such cases, hiring lawyers and paying legal expenses. In one instance, a group of

            <p>Individual Friends were willing to take more dangerous public stands to aid African Americans who
                    found themselves facing public prejudice and attack. The best–known example is of
                    Frederick Douglass, probably the leading black abolitionist in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, who visited Pendleton, Indiana, in the fall of 1843 and was attacked by
                    anti–abolitionists. Rebecca Fussell, an abolitionist Hicksite <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> woman, tried to shield Douglass from the mob by standing in front of him with her baby,
                    but to no avail. After Douglass was injured, he was taken to the home of a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> couple, Neal and Elizabeth Hardy. Douglass ever remembered the care that the kindly
                    Elizabeth Hardy gave him. The next day, despite the violence, the Hicksite Friends opened their
                    meetinghouse near Pendleton for a speech by Douglass. Three years earlier, when a black man married
                    a white woman in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a mob had stormed the house where they were spending their wedding night and ridden
                    the bride through town on a rail. The husband barely escaped with his life, but found refuge at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>

                    </placeName>, working for Friend Levi Coffin. Eventually, he was reunited with his wife. In 1844,
                    when a slaveholder from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>

                        <region type="county">Hamilton County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, Friends bedeviled him at every turn. First they tried to prevent his
                    apprehension of the couple, then helped them escape, then took them to safety in a <placeName>

            <p>Probably best known, and doubtless considerably embroidered by legend, is the role of Quakers in the
                    Underground Railroad. While it was the fugitive slave, not the "conductor," who
                    took the greatest risk, and while free blacks in the north were as central, if not more so, to the
                    enterprise as whites, <list type="footnotes">

               </figure> it is nevertheless true that midwestern Quakers worked closely and in a relationship of
                    trust with African–American neighbors. One abolitionist in southwestern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> remembered that fugitives would first approach free blacks but that the free blacks
                    referred them to nearby Quakers, "for the colored people thought them safer among the
                    whites than with themselves, and they were right, for the slave hunters would be more apt to use
                    violence on them than on whites." According to later reminiscences, fugitives crossing the

                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>

                    </placeName> settlements in Rush and Henry counties. Some Friends hired fugitives to work at

                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>

                    conservative Friends opposed aiding fugitive slaves, but those criticized responded with denials.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

            <p>What, if anything, do Quakers' actions reveal about racial attitudes of ordinary Friends as
                    they struggled with questions of colonization, black migration, interracial marriage, membership,
                    and the roles of black people in their communities and the larger American society? As any historian
                    of religion is aware, doctrinal and policy statements by denominational leaders and authorities are
                    often not normative for the membership. Several historians have pointed to examples of prejudice
                    among Friends in the East. There the handful of African–American Quakers before 1860 were
                    often seated in galleries or at the rear of meetinghouses, and black graves were separated from
                    white in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> cemeteries, when they were allowed at all. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> charity in institutions such as orphanages and "free schools" was
                    dispensed in the same manner. Occasional applications for membership from black people were
                    sometimes subjected to long procedural delays. Abolitionists after 1830 denounced what they saw as
                    the prejudice of more conservative Friends. "They will give us good advice. They will aid
                    in giving us a partial education—but never in a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> school, beside their own children. Whatever they do for us savors of pity, and is done

            <p>Still, there are indications of ambivalence on the part of some Friends, and an embrace of the racial
                    attitudes of the larger white society by others. A good example lies in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> response to the colonization movement, which sought to link the abolition of slavery to
                    the removal of free blacks to Africa or the Caribbean. Abolitionists after 1830 decried such
                    requirements. In 1836 the Indiana Yearly Meeting (Orthodox) officially condemned what it called
                    "the unrighteous work of expatriation." Yet at least one leading Orthodox
                    minister, Jeremiah Hubbard, was known for his colonization sympathies. Even more striking is the
                    case of the long–time clerk of the Orthodox yearly meeting, Elijah Coffin. Early in the
                    1840s, Coffin penned a long essay that he entitled "On Home Colonization." In it
                    he suggested that emancipation be linked to the establishment of an independent black nation in the
                    great American desert (meaning the West in general), with blacks forcibly removed to it, if
                    necessary. Coffin was quite willing to invoke the horrors of "amalgamation" as
                    justification for his proposal. Even one actively abolitionist Friend finally embraced colonization.

                    "finally came to the conclusion that as his forefathers helped to bring slavery in the
                    country it would be better to tax him with other property and create a fund for their purchase and
                    settlement in some good place." <list type="footnotes">

                    Indiana, wrote in 1826 that "I hold it as indisputably correct, viz that every free person
                    has a right to go where he pleases, if he has means to Justify it &amp; if there are people of
                    colour found here amongst us we feel bound to advise &amp; assist them in getting employment
                    Etc. But there is a very strong prejudice in the minds of many people, against the emigration of the
                    people of colour to the western States—and from various considerations on the subject, I
                    had much rather Government would locate a colony for them some where in the S [outh] West of this
                    continent." Still, one should distinguish between colonizationists who rejoiced at the

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and those like Hadley and Talbert who had sadly concluded that massive white prejudice
                    made any other solution impossible.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other Friends expressed different fears, particularly at times when large numbers of free blacks were

                    </placeName> that "the prejudice against a colored population was as great in Indiana, as

                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>, and that there was as much of it in the minds of members of our Society there as in
                    other people." That same year, another elderly Friend said that he would rather see Indiana
                    a slave state than to have free blacks in it. In the 1840s, an Orthodox Friend in Indiana was quoted
                    as saying "she would be afraid of her life if the slaves were set free." For
                    virtually all Friends, interracial marriage was more than they could bear; even committed
                    abolitionists like Levi Coffin opposed it, although he did not think that it should be illegal.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>We also have evidence that Friends were more accepting of lighter–skinned people of color
                    than darker ones. Mary C. Thorne, an Orthodox Friend in <placeName>

               </placeName>, remembered that
                    in 1856 her family sheltered a fugitive slave. "She was quite superior to the ordinary
                    class of persons whom we had met in that way: in the first place she was white with light brown
                    straight hair," Thorne wrote. "Her eyes were gray with a quick nervous flash about
                    them that took in her surroundings at a glance." The family was so taken with her that she
                    remained with them until her death sixteen years later.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>For many, the most perplexing aspect of the relationship between African Americans and Quakers was
                    the extremely small number of blacks who joined the Society of Friends. This was a cause of concern
                    for visiting English Friends. In 1819, for example, a traveling Friend visiting eastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> asked Quakers there "whether Black People were admitted in Friends Society.
                    The answer they returned was that some of their members were opposed to it, but those only that were
                    prejudiced against them by education." There were some black members, however. The English
                    ministers Robert and Sarah Lindsay, visiting <placeName>

               </placeName>, in 1858, recorded that in the
                    Birch Lake Meeting, "one of their members is a coloured man; others of the same race were
                    present." Richard Chopple, a black member of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, died in 1848 at the reputed age of 107. The fervent abolitionist Rebecca L.

                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, just after the separation in 1842, recorded that an

                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName> was given a place of honor at the front of the building and spoke during meeting for
                    worship. But such cases were few. Racism may have been a factor. In 1859 and 1860, William Tallack,
                    an English Friend traveling in America, noted that Friends in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> explained the lack of black interest in becoming Quakers on the basis of the inability

            <p>Still, for every example of individual prejudice we have just as many indicating more enlightened
                    views. It may mean something that Elijah Coffin never published "On Home
                    Colonization." He recorded in his diary that the atmosphere of the Meeting for Sufferings
                    session that condemned the black exclusion provision of the pending Indiana constitution in 1850 was
                    "low," suggesting that the protest was more than just <hi rend="i">pro forma</hi>;
                    Friends were genuinely disturbed. The fear of African–American immigrants on the part of
                    some Friends did not prevent others from welcoming new arrivals, even after such immigration became
                    illegal in Indiana in 1851. At times we see Friends struggling with their prejudices. A good example
                    is the 1826 report of the Committee on the Concerns of the People of Color on the emigration of free
                    blacks from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>. The report conceded the possible desirability of avoiding "an accession of
                    this class of population as neighbours," but then added that the committee members were
                    "concerned to impress the minds of Friends that our prejudices should yield to the
                    interests and happiness of our fellow beings, and that we exert no influence that would deprive them
                    of the rights of free Agents in removing to any part of the world most congenial to their
                    interests." Similarly, an Orthodox Friend (probably Elijah Coffin) responded to criticism
                    from Anti–Slavery Friends in 1843 by admitting that "there may be too much
                    prejudice among us," but, insisting, "if there is, we have reason to hope and
                    believe that there is a disposition to be corrected, when convinced, and to endeavor to come to the
                    right standard."<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Friends carried this resolve to struggle against prejudice into their personal relationships. There
                    is no indication that Friends in the Midwest ever segregated their few black members and visitors.

            <p>Thus the experience of Quakers and African Americans in the Midwest was complex. Some Friends
                    certainly did share the attitudes of the larger society; some, perhaps a majority, were simply
                    apathetic on issues relating to race. In the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName>, Friends of all
                    persuasions favored legal equality, and eschewed the segregation that characterized the world around

            <p>Tocqueville, perhaps the most prophetic and certainly the most cited nineteenth–century
                    foreign observer of American life, had more to say about the image, reality, and significance of
                    violence than scholars have recognized. Like many of his contemporaries who observed Jacksonian
                    America, he was puzzled by the ambiguous relationship between honor, violence, and social class,
                    particularly as it played out in the ritual of the duel. The refusal of a challenge to duel,
                    Tocqueville noted, was the only act he knew to be considered both honorable and dishonorable.

                    roots and strong influence," he wrote, these rules were "like a religion whose

                    Jacksonian ethic of spontaneous and uninhibited freedom from prescribed social, legal, and political
                    barriers. Moreover, the discrepancy between the image these men wished to secure and the reality of
                    their actions has been virtually ignored. The frontier "affair of honor" was often
                    conducted, portrayed, and construed in a manner inconsistent with the gentlemanly precepts that its
                    champions staunchly defended. This essay examines the identity of the frontier duelist as defined by
                    himself, his peers, perceptive travelers, newspaper editors, religious and political figures, and
                    fiction writers. Focused on the midwestern frontier, its primary subjects are elites, aspiring
                    elites, and their ostensible inferiors.</p>

                    argue that a select northern middle class, through its control of publishing, politics, the pulpit,
                    free–labor ideology, and bourgeois middle–class values, culturally dominated
                    the region in the antebellum era. As a result, Yankee notions of manhood, honor, and gentility have
                    obfuscated the breadth of the influences that went into cultural and social formation on the
                    frontier. As late as 1850, Yankee–born settlers from New <placeName>

            <p>Frontier settlers, whether they were subsistence farmers, squatters, or wage laborers, shared an
                    antipathy towards both the southern planter class and "penny–pinching"
                    Yankees. This was particularly the case if the planters or Yankee's wealth was inherited
                    rather than earned. Superior status did not automatically transfer from the regions of provenance,
                    but had to be earned all over again on the frontier. The position of frontier elites was thus far
                    less secure in a region that was experiencing significant political, economic, and demographic
                    change; the result was tremendous social ambiguity and insecurity. Nevertheless, some folks rose to
                    a higher station. Those who did were likely to be legal, political, or medical professionals, or
                    aspiring elites, including younger, up–and–coming statesmen, professionals,
                    and farmers. The last group often won the support of a rural public hostile to excesses in wealth
                    and political power and devoted to a vigorous, self–governing brand of republicanism.
                    Higher status was acceptable on the frontier, as long as it was earned fairly. The parameters of
                    fair play were negotiated via competing notions of masculinity and honor. Sometimes, but not as
                    often as has been argued, violence was involved.</p>
            <p>This essay also addresses the paradoxical typology of lethal violence common to the antebellum
                    frontier, in the process challenging conventional ideas about the extent to which gentlemen duelists
                    were able to convince the public of their time as well as posterity that dueling was not only widely
                    practiced and accepted, but was also more manly and honorable than the disorderly
                    "roughhousing" engaged in by the lower sort. Portraying dueling as an exceptional,
                    ritualistic, symbolic, neurotic, and ineffective practice embraced by a marginal segment of frontier
                    society, this study compares the notorious custom to "common" violence that was,
                    arguably, more effective, more consistent with democratic principles, and equally governed by civic
                    parameters and conventional rules, hi offering a new lens through which to view the relationship
                    between violence, class, honor, and masculinity in a region emblematic of the democratic experiment

            <p>Territorial politics on the old frontier were highly personal. Yet on the basis of merely anecdotal
                    evidence it has been argued that because dueling was inevitable, laws against the practice were
                    quickly adopted. Although the Indiana territorial legislature established fines of up to 250 dollars
                    as well as jail sentences of up to twelve months for challenging someone to a duel, these measures
                    do not necessarily indicate a great propensity towards dueling on the part of the
                    territory's earliest settlers.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> This argument fails to consider the
                    demeanor and concerns of the region's migrants, as well as the territory's
                    interest in attracting newcomers. As emigrants from the largest donor state to Indiana, <placeName>

                            Qamer furthers the argument that such laws were not designed as a solution to violence in
                            general; they were, rather, designed to curtail a certain kind of violence that was, in
                            turn, "a side effect of a well–intentioned effort at reforming American
                            society." Attempting to uncover state motivation for adopting weapon laws, Cramer
                            argues that reformers tried to use laws to improve the morals of the masses but were
                            unsuccessful. Because the various legal consequences that states adopted to combat dueling
                            were contrary to popular culture, murder and manslaughter replaced the code as the method
                            for resolving insults (pp. 7, 139—41). Although provocative, this is an
                            ahistorical argument. Cramer fails to recognize that with the duel, he is dealing with an
                            infrequent, exclusive event. Murder, manslaughter, and even rioting, were much closer to the
                            norm. Various scholars have maintained (often with insufficient evidence, but at times more
                            convincingly) that violence was the defining element of frontier life, and decades of
                            movies, television, and pulp fiction have reinforced such assertions. Nonetheless, some have
                            sought a more realistic approach, and have taken into account many factors to contest the
                            thesis that Richard Slotkin has termed "regeneration through violence."

            <p>Violence, particularly when it resulted in death, was an infrequent occurrence on the midwestern
                    frontier. In his first volume of the <hi rend="i">Western Monthly Review</hi> published in 1828 in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, editor Timothy Flint included an essay on "The National Character of the
                    Western People," in which he noted that in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> country "the annual number of deaths from violence … has been less,
                    in proportion to its population, than any other state in the Union." Novelist James
                    Fenimore Cooper, visiting the same region, observed that duels there were "less frequent
                    than in any other civilized country."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> And yet Cooper may have
                    introduced his own frontier archetype, the expert marksman and hunter Leatherstocking, a bit early

                    </placeName> magazines from the 1830s recently led a scholar to conclude that education, not
                    hunting, received the most editorial space. Of the 356 articles published in the first three years
                    of the <hi rend="i">Western Monthly Magazine</hi>, only one was on hunting and a second dealt with a
                    shooting match. <hi rend="i">Western</hi> Miscellany, in its first year, devoted only two of more
                    than 300 articles to hunting. The former magazine, claiming that "we aspire to be
                    useful," contained no mention of dueling pistols, military weapons, or gaming strategies,
                    while the latter maintained that respect for the law and avoidance of violence was far more
                    characteristic of the West than the East. Frontier travelers expecting to witness the seduction and
                    vengeance of the wilderness that were popular themes in both country folklore and western fiction

                    free of violence, although such altercations as occurred were rarely lethal and typically
                    exaggerated, just as the duel was. Canal construction laborers ("navvies") worked
                    long hours for meager pay in terrible conditions, and were exposed to such diseases as malaria,
                    cholera, and tuberculosis. Alienated economically from the skilled labor market, they were seen as
                    offering mere "animal power" to prepare the ground for industrial production.
                    Marginalized socially from mainstream society, their drinking, cursing, gambling, and brawling was
                    viewed by their peers as anything but constructive. Violent clashes between canallers and local
                    residents were not uncommon; nor was the sort of roughhousing typical of the canal worker's
                    culture. Such behavior nevertheless does not entirely warrant British traveler James Silk
                    Buckingham's judgment that canal workers were "not merely poor, but…
                    drunken, dirty, indolent, and riotous, so as to be the objects of dislike and fear to all in whose
                    neighborhood they congregate in large numbers." Canallers found in sporadic violence what
                    historian Peter Way has called a "rough camaraderie" central to the culture of
                    "maleness" that served as a reaction to their social exclusion. Was elite violence
                    (as infrequent as it was) and behavior the only kind that could be "honorable"? By
                    whose definition do we limit the quality and accessibility of "maleness"? Such
                    questions are particularly relevant in areas and occupations where violence is thought to be
                        widespread.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

                    exaggerated tales of Davy Crockett, Mike Fink, and other adventurous, hard–drinking,
                    violent frontier heroes (affectionately remembered as the "Alligator Horses" in
                    frontier novels and legends). By the 1820s, flatboatmen were responsible, educated, and religious,
                    and perceived themselves as family men who had given up their bad habits. They were
                    "Jacksonian Men," not by virtue of their reckless disposition or their freedom
                    from restraint, but due instead to their admission (or entrance) as "common men"
                    into the budding capitalist economy. Nonetheless, as Michael Allen argues, the myth of the Alligator
                    Horse came to provide Jacksonian America with an alter ego, a "darker side with which
                    law–abiding citizens could secretly identify even while following the norms of civilized

                    about justice. Nevertheless, Illinoisans, whether quieting political disputes, abolishing debtor
                    imprisonment, forming settlers' associations as a defense against large–scale
                    land speculators, or eliminating de facto slavery in state supreme court decisions, adhered to a
                    robust republicanism in which consensus usually precluded bloodshed. An 1810 territorial statute
                    that mandated the death penalty for anyone found guilty of killing his opponent in a duel was either

                    A second duel, in 1842, was averted by the humor and ingenuity of Abraham Lincoln after accepting

                    violence exemplified a social hierarchy whose members sought to civilize a rugged and socially
                    immature society. Comparing the surviving accounts of these incidents to the scholarly work
                    thereafter reveals the numerous difficulties that accompany blanket statements and rash
                    generalizations of frontier violence, the images of its participants, and their relationships to

            <p>Benjamin Truman, whose history of dueling in America, published in 1884, was one of the earliest

                    </placeName>, which Lincoln staunchly defended in legislatorial debates, was forced to close, its
                    notes having become valueless. Shields, a Democrat acting in his capacity as state auditor, ordered
                    that the notes not be accepted in payment of taxes. The Whigs' response was immediate and
                    ruthless. They attacked the Democratic administration through Shields, who, next to Stephen A.
                    Douglas, was the party's leading young representative. Lincoln was the ringleader of this
                    derisive cabal. Writing under the alias of "Aunt Rebecca," an unpolished but
                    clever countrywoman who had "authored" previous letters to the editor of the
                    Sangamo <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> from "Lost Township," he blamed the financial
                    crisis on the Democrats, insisting that Shields's announcement was "a lie, and not

                    With him truth is out of the question." Lincoln next encouraged two friends, Mary Todd
                    (whom he had been courting) and Julia Jayne, to contribute criticism ridiculing Shields's
                    self–promoted image as irresistible to women. Lincoln biographer David Herbert Donald

            <p>Lincoln's engagement in the politics of character assassination led to an embarrassing
                    compromise of his personal and civic principles. His behavior emphasizes the anxiety and insecurity
                    of frontier political culture. When Lincoln assumed full public responsibility for all of the
                    "Lost Township" letters, Shields responded in the Sangamo <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>, demanding "a full, positive, and absolute retraction of all offensive
                    allusions used in these communications." Privately, Lincoln admitted that, being
                    "wholly opposed to dueling," he would "do anything to avoid it that might
                    not degrade him in the estimation of himself and friends." Lincoln's immediate
                    concern for his reputation, which drove him to accept Shields's challenge, epitomized
                    Jackso–nian political behavior—behavior that was subsequently exaggerated by
                    scholars and the public alike to emphasize its hostile and vindictive aspects. Dr. Elias H.

                    September 22, and the duel was set. With his right as the challenged party to choose the weapons,
                    Lincoln selected "cavalry swords of the largest size," which ridiculously
                    terminated the affair as Shields was much shorter than he.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Lincoln further

                    sentence of one to five years. The double–edged cavalry "dragoon"
                    broadsword was awkward and heavy, and while Lincoln had practiced for nearly a month to perfect his
                    technique, Shields had not. The duel never occurred. Lincoln, emboldened by his broadsword prowess,
                    later claimed, "I did not intend to hurt Shields unless I did so clearly in
                    self–defense," for, if necessary, "I could have split him from the

                    Neither Lincoln nor his close friends spoke of it afterward. Donald argues that Lincoln's
                    later tendency to satirize himself was a direct consequence of the undisciplined humor and personal
                    castigation exploited in the "Lost Township" letters.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Was it
                    that a significant transformation of accepted "gentlemanly" and

                    —above all, the spontaneous, uninhibited reaction to all personal insults—
                    came to assume an increasingly uncomfortable, anachronistic position on the antebellum frontier?
                    Whatever he thought of the duel itself, Lincoln's decision to expose its absurdities at the
                    time should lead us to question arguments by historians who have stressed the reciprocal importance
                    of honor, character, and revenge to the early American political tradition.</p>
            <p>Both encounters, Stuart–Bennett and Lincoln–Shields, were typical of the
                    frontier duel. The former was provoked by insults to a horse, micro–managed by the
                    wronged party, subverted by a gentleman whose intention was only to scare his opponent, and
                    conducted in the open. The latter was meticulously crafted by a struggling young Whig lawyer who,
                    although holding a lopsided advantage, was willing to surrender the contest by virtue of a foot
                    fault. Neither Bennett nor his seconds, who escaped conviction but not ridicule, garnered the
                    honorable status they had coveted. Lincoln's aborted duel with Shields, although devoid of
                    violence, was of a similar ilk: Lincoln insulted and provoked a social superior, reluctantly
                    consented to arms, and <list type="footnotes">

                    lower– and upper–class, in resolving conflicts. While violence was generally
                    rare, it did capture the notice of some observers. William Blane, upon visiting Albion County in the
                    1820s, noted that "a custom much to be blamed among the better class in the Western States
                    is that of wearing of concealed weapons." He was also struck by the rough tactics of the
                    backwoodsman, whereby "the object is to take his adversary by surprise; and then, as soon
                    as he has thrown him down, either to 'gouge' him, that is, to poke his eye out, or
                    else to get his nose or ear into his mouth and bite it off." Some scholars maintain that
                    this "savage" and "inferior" mode of fighting, so disdained by
                    elites, had its own "culture" of honor, and that it was more manly, more
                    democratic, and more typical of frontier regions where hunting, herding, unskilled labor, and
                    semisubsistence agriculture predominated.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> These frontiersmen with their
                    rough–and–tumble behavior, along with the canallers and rivermen, set the
                    parameters of manly honor and were the chief transmitters of the frontier's violent
                    culture; elites struggled to match the standard set by their social inferiors. Napoleon Murat noted
                    in 1826 that disputes among western squatters were "amicably terminated by the
                    fist." Other observers noted that community–sanctioned meetings, including
                    "some of the most prominent men in the county," were settled
                    "fairly" in "fisticuffs" style without "resorting to
                    knives or pistols," and often ended in handshakes, drinking, and "good
                    times." Such reports give us a clearer picture of the character of frontier violence, in
                    which republican restraint and deference to community norms minimized its lethality. After examining

                    judicial branch employees, and lawyers, as well as laws against carrying concealed weapons, such as
                    dirks, pistols, large knifes, and sword–in–canes for all persons except
                        travelers.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Linking the concealed–weapon laws directly to
                    dueling, and citing the numerous revisions of the dueling oaths that exempted lawyers and other
                    groups from expulsion as evidence of the honor code's prevalence, some scholars maintain
                    that legislation to control dueling resulted in <hi rend="i">more</hi> instances of outright
                    manslaughter. Dueling, however, was not necessarily the chief concern that prompted
                    concealed–weapon statutes as the listing of crude weaponry and the exemption of travelers
                    suggests. Gentlemen solved disputes at ten paces with pistols that were <hi rend="i">not</hi>
                    concealed, and travelers may have sported pistols to confirm their social superiority amid the lower
                    orders of the frontier backwoods. Moreover, the vagueness of the term "traveler"
                    may have protected duelists, many of whom crossed state lines in order to duel. The argument that
                    anti–dueling laws increased manslaughter is interesting in that it divorces the image of
                    the duel as an honorable and chivalrous affair from that of the callous and uncivilized violence
                    that elites dismissed as less sophisticated, less manly, and less honorable. But less sophistication
                    did not mean greater mortality rates; it simply meant more physical contact, which required greater
                    courage. <placeName>

            <p>There was nothing natural or self–evident about limiting the entitlement of gentlemanly
                    honor to a certain class on the midwestern frontier. Frontier elites lived in a society where
                    instability greatly overshadowed any clear division of class. A veneer of masculinity and
                    respectability was threatened by a social ambiguity that led many Europeans to praise America as a
                    classless, egalitarian republic. If violence was a means to distinguish aspiring elites from the
                    lower orders of society, it failed miserably. Duels, riots, workplace militancy and other examples
                    of violent behavior do not necessarily represent explicit divisions on the social ladder. It was
                    insecurity, not destiny, that was manifest in this moving, settling, and industrializing nation
                    —a fact that observers of the time readily noted. Cultural norms and institutions were
                    threatened, and behavior was often unpredictable, a recipe for disaster for historians who hate it
                    when their subjects do not act the way they should. James Fenimore Cooper, pretending to be a
                    European in his <hi rend="i">Notions of the Americans</hi>, admitted that "so singular a
                    compound of intelligence, kindness, natural politeness, coarseness, and even vulgarity"
                    left him "utterly baffled in the attempt to give them a place in the social
                    scale." Karen Halttunen has gone even further, arguing that the "American
                    democrat" occupied no fixed social position, and thus "no status in the strict
                    sense of the term."<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>Whether or not the frontier "code of honor" was protected by law or, conversely,
                    existed only because of the absence of law, it was at times difficult to discern the behavior of its
                    adherents from that of their alleged inferiors. When William Blane noted in 1822 that "the
                    Western Americans, particularly those of Indiana, are more rough and unpolished in their manners
                    than those of any country I [have] ever traveled in," he did not make clear whether he
                    meant westerners in general or a particular class among them. William Faux suggested one possible
                    division when he expressed his considerable relief upon entering the Hoosier state: "At
                    sun–rise I left <placeName>

                    </placeName>." Charles Augustus Murray later suggested that westerners who were
                    "rough, overbearing, and quarrelsome" could likewise be "brave, generous,
                    proud, frank, and hospitable." Attending the horse races in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he was taken aback by "the swearing of some of the lower orders in the West,
                    especially among horse–traders and gamblers," that would "shock ears
                    … so full it is of blasphemy." In 1820, James Flint found "nothing in
                    human form so profligate" as the western boatmen he encountered: "Accomplished in
                    depravity, their habits and education seem to comprehend every vice. They make few pretensions to
                    moral character; and their swearing is excessive, and perfectly disgusting."<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                    Dickinson, who proceeded to insult the general's wife and "post" the him
                    as "a worthless scoundrel, poltroon, and coward." The verbal abuse cost Dickinson
                    his life, although a faulty pistol which snapped at half–cock, by rule counting as a
                    shot, granted Dickinson the opportunity to lodge a bullet into Jackson's chest that would
                    eventually contribute to his death. Lethal violence of any sort occurred too infrequently in the
                    frontier Midwest to justify D. H. Lawrence's famous remark that "the essential
                    American soul is hard, isolate, stoic, and a killer." One source after another reminds us
                    that actual crimes of violence were quite rare, and that the rural frontier saw nothing on the scale
                    of the mob actions (including seventy–three major riots between 1828 and 1835 alone) seen
                    at the same time in American cities.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

                    demeanor on the frontier, and in the process shed light on the importance of reputation. The writer
                    allowed that "learning in general, talents, honor, virtue, integrity, and
                    morality" were "passports into the first ranks" in some places, and that
                    "music, painting, dancing, and the like," were "held in high
                    estimation" in others. But, recognizing that such knowledge was far from universal
                    (antebellum Indiana ranked dead last in literacy and education among free states), Squib quipped
                    that to rise in frontier society an aspirant must follow a few "concise and irifaliable
                    [sic] rules" that would ensure an aspirant the "dignified elevation of a member of

            <p>On the antebellum frontier, then, dueling statesmen facing unpredictable social, political, and
                    economic changes responded by creating a facade of masculinity in keeping with what Halttunen
                    describes as the "theatricality" of middle– and upper–class
                    social life in nineteenth–century America. Frontier duelists were in this sense not
                    unlike Halltunen's parlor women, who ruled dress, etiquette, and social ritual by the
                    "sentimental typology of conduct"—that is, a set of rules that reduced
                    all aspects of social interaction to outward marks of inner character.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

            <p>The ideological tenets and political emotions of Jacksonian America were strangely applied by men
                    seeking elite status on the antebellum frontier. The frontier duel was, in practice, often
                    antithetical to the intensity, simplicity, and immediacy that subsequent observers have so
                    inseparably linked to this violent period in American history. The code of honor was more expensive
                    and inconvenient than it was dangerous. With the Colt revolver not in mainstream circulation until
                    the late 1840s, and because imported dueling pistols easily exceeded the budget of an aspiring
                    frontier gentleman, many had to wait weeks for an heirloom set to arrive courtesy of a sympathetic
                    southerner. Henry Clay, for example, was known to loan his own set if the cause was just (although
                    with his shooting record, he should have been practicing). Most duelists resorted to bulky horse

                    support the family of the deceased. Typically, these men put more energy into their published
                    condemnations of enemies than their marksman skills, often delayed or ducked challenges, and
                    consented to duels not with the intention to harm their opponent but to seek
                    "satisfaction." For the minority who did arrive at the field of honor ready to
                    kill, the two alternatives were equally dishonorable. To shoot and kill was to lose honor in the
                    eyes of the community, to be labeled an "assassin," a "depraved

                    objecting that this distance was still "too great for his sight," Prentice then
                    proposed that they fight with small swords, which Trotter deemed "too close." A
                    day later, when the duel finally took place, "the ball of Mr. Trotter's pistol
                    made a slight contusion on the side of Mr. Prentice, whose pistol snapped—after which
                    they threw their pistols at each other and engaged in an ordinary scuffle." Neither party
                    was injured. The Indiana <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> commented that "the manner of his attack

                    omnipotent frontiersman as was Cooper's Leather–stocking (and his numerous

                    are allowed to remain but in which no one longer believes," to quote Tocqueville. The duel
                    itself, as it was played out on the frontier, could hardly exist in fiction, where killers were far
                    removed from the complexities of politics, family relations, love, and work; where existence
                    required a repudiation of all worldly responsibilities in a setting of unanticipated dangers, and
                    where violence retained a certain innocence, devoid of all social consequences. The western novel
                    stripped its killer of all grudges, reducing the struggle to one of man against nature, while the
                    frontier duelist, unhappy with the nature of man, sought violent recourse to alter or strengthen his
                        worldly'image.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

                    travelers' accounts to personal histories, secondary scholarship, and western fiction, he
                    reviewed a host of representations, including the "romance" and
                    "wilderness" myths of the frontier, as well as the Kentuckian as playful savage,
                    epic warrior, agent of progress, and child of nature. In this cultural analysis, Moore argued that
                    while the Kentuckian was a unique contributor to the social formation of the West, he was a
                    "great deal more complex than the simple–minded Indian fighter imagined in

            <p>If midwestern frontier duelists were concerned mostly with saving face, to what do we owe the
                    longevity of their image as brave, self–sufficient upholders of manly honor? The answer
                    lies in part in the easy adaptability of the practice to the moral certitudes of fiction, where
                    killers were far removed from the complexities of politics, family relations, love, and work; where
                    existence required a repudiation of all worldly responsibilities in a setting of unanticipated
                    dangers; and where violence retained a certain innocence, devoid of social consequences. From
                    Cooper's Leatherstocking on, the western novel reconciled the ideal of the honorable
                    gentleman with that of the self–sufficient frontiersman, as it had developed in countless
                        folktales.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

                    society. Elites were often the ones who reflected on the duel, wrote about it in newspapers and
                    journals, and felt obliged to defend its legitimacy and function in American society.
                    Upper–class men dueled to appear more manly while denouncing their social inferiors, who,
                    in adhering to the common–sense core of masculinity—sheer physical
                    courage—lacked the polish, the gentleman's grace of manner. Indeed, the lower
                    orders of society might be said to have embodied the physical realities of manhood while their
                    superiors, more dependent upon its image, compromised manliness with gentlemanly decorum. Yet, this
                    compromise was significant, for it promoted manners and integrity over aggression while still laying
                    claim to traditional masculine values of strength and bravery. Through such language, frontier
                    elites sought to distinguish "good" violence from "bad," and
                    thereby to justify their own claims to superior status in a fluid and uncertain social climate.</p>
            <p>As we have seen, however, violence on the frontier was infrequent; when it did occur it was rarely
                    lethal and occasionally quite farcical. The American frontier legacy and its central exaggerations,
                    particularly those that lay claim to a "violent heritage," have been transmitted
                    ahistorically. Despite scholarship maintaining that frontier relations in general were characterized
                    by cooperation as much as they were by conflict, and despite the availability of sources indicating
                    the skepticism with which people of the time often greeted pretensions of frontier honor, Americans
                    still picture the frontier as a place where gentlemen duelists fearlessly settled their differences
                    with swords and pistols. Clearly, this image favors the exception and not the rule.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

            <p>The significance of examining more carefully the conduct and portrayal of frontier violence, both
                    real and imagined, is twofold. First, it reveals the difficulties and ambiguities that plagued rnen
                    seeking power in an expanding frontier society. The American democratic experiment opened the way to
                    a universal scramble for distinction in which many people, particularly elites, were doomed to
                    disappointment. Second, it compares the reality of frontier life to popular images in order to
                    dispute the notion that violence was frequent and inevitable, and that any one class or group of
                    people was respon– <list type="footnotes">

                    the fears and anxieties of a certain class of elite white men than with any abstract notion of
                    honor. These men who dueled to attain or maintain this honor had perhaps the <hi rend="i">least</hi>
                    control over it. Capitola Black, the heroine of E.D.E.N. (Emma) Southworth's popular novels
                    of the 1850s, exposed the ambiguity of the concept by humiliating her
                    "gentlemanly" challenger, Craven Le Noir, when she "raised her pistol,
                    took deliberate aim at his white forehead, and fired—Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
                    Bang!" striking him with "poor powder and dried peas," so that both the

                    westward expansion. Far from the devastating atrocities of war, slavery, lynching, and genocide, the
                    duel gives us a chance to separate the reality of frontier violence from its image. In many ways,
                    the frontier served as a great leveler for that small proportion of elite white men who struggled to
                    preserve an old tradition in a new environment. And yet, their dilemma ran deeper than their words,
                    pistols, and blows. These men struggled with their inability to impose exclusive views of violence,
                    masculinity, and honor on a rapidly expanding and diversifying population. In doing so, they were
                    far from emblematic of the frontier experience.</p>

            <p>One year ago, subscribers to the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine oj History</hi> received a
                    questionnaire regarding the journal. Its main purpose was to gauge readers' opinions about
                    the magazine's content. Responses poured in; by the time I joined the editorial staff in
                    June more than one thousand of them had piled up in the IMH office.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> What
                    follows is a reflective analysis of the content of those responses. It draws both on numeric
                    data—which reveal significant trends and aggregates—and on hundreds of written
                    comments from individual readers, which highlight their unique interests and suggestions, their
                    views about history publishing, and their thoughts about Indiana and its history This report was
                    not'produced by a committee or a computer. Instead, it represents a personal perspective
                    that I hope can serve as the next installment of an ongoing "conversation" between
                    the readers and editors of the IMH. I also hope it will tell you something about yourself as a
                    reader, as a Hoosier, and as a part of a community devoted to carrying Indiana's history
                    into the twenty–first century.</p>

            <p>READERS RESPOND TO THE SURVEY</p>
            <p>The survey accompanying the March 2003 issue consisted of nine questions and an added space for
                    written comments (see Figure 1). The questions solicited readers' opinions about the
                    articles, book reviews, topics, and time periods covered by the magazine. The majority of the
                    questions asked readers to circle their opinion on a five–point scale ranging from
                    "agree strongly" to "disagree strongly" with "no
                    opinion" in the center. The surveys were sent to 8,142 subscribers; and, in the ensuing
                    months, 1,219 were returned, a response rate of 15 percent.</p>
            <p>The responses to the eight numeric questions are compiled in Table 1. Chart 1 summarizes graphically
                    the three questions that received the most uniformly positive response: numbers one, two, and eight.
                    Combining the "strongly agree" and "somewhat agree" responses
                    for these three questions, we see that 82 percent of readers enjoy most of the articles, 74 percent
                    like reading the reviews, and 73 percent would like to learn more about local history activities
                    around the state. Other questions yield more equivocal responses. A slight majority of
                    readers—52 percent—indicated that they usually read the magazine carefully.
                    Just under half—47 percent—agreed that they have decided to read or not read a
                    book based on its review in the magazine. Readers were evenly split on the question of whether they
                    are interested in reading about Indiana's neighboring states.</p>
            <p>In other cases, the pattern of readers' responses revealed interesting variations from one
                    question to the next. When plotted graphically, the responses to question four—which asks
                    if readers only glance through the magazine—and to question five—which
                    inquires as to whether they enjoy the <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> as much as they do <hi rend="i">Traces
                        of Indiana and Midwestern History</hi>—reveal high levels of both agreement and
                    disagreement, with relatively few responding "no opinion" (Chart 2). On the other
                    hand, responses to questions six and seven, designed to gauge interest in recent history and in
                    neighboring states respectively, form a smooth "bell–curve" pattern,
                    with the largest number of respondents declaring "no opinion" on question six and
                    "somewhat disagree" on seven (Chart 3).</p>
            <p>Readers did more than simply circle the numbered responses offered them. They thought about the
                    questions, puzzled over their nuances, and even rewrote them to their liking.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                            "most" in question one. Another felt that question five was unclear, while
                            a third rewrote the question. Still another challenged the editors' choice of terms
                            by crossing out "Civil War" and writing in, "The War of Northern
                            Aggression!" Others seemed to believe that "Native Americans" and
                            the "frontier period" should have been separated in question nine. On
                            question nine, a respondent marked "no preference," but wrote in,
                            "just less on war, men, and politicians."</item>

            <p>"A TREASURE OF RESEARCH"</p>
            <p>As I stated earlier, most readers expressed their approval of the IMH. They described the magazine as
                    "excellent," "a treasure of research," or a "great
                    asset to the state," thanking the editorial staff for its "good work" and
                    urging them to "continue [their] high standards."</p>
            <p>Most readers responded positively, as well, to the IMH's articles, commenting that they
                    "marvel at the time and effort that go into these articles"; that they are
                    "quite pleased with the articles &amp; the variety of subjects chosen"; and
                    that they find the articles "well written" and "always educational and
                    worthwhile." On the other hand, we received a much higher comment rate from those who
                    disapproved of the articles. As a rule, this minority felt the articles are too long. One reader
                    equated brevity and interest: "Some articles are too long and, thus, boring."
                    Other readers found the articles "dull," "dry &amp;
                    technical," or "uneven—sometimes stodgy."</p>
            <p>Critics of the IMH's book reviews—while also in the minority—reflected
                    a range of opinion. "Too many book reviews," wrote one, while another wished <pb n="61" id="VAA4025-100-1-069"/>

                    <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-100-1-070"/> the editors "would cut down on the reviews and have
                    more feature articles." One respondent found the reviews "so short &amp;
                    superficial as to be of little value," and another called for "more books about
                    Indiana." At the same time, other readers told us that they found the reviews to be the
                    most useful part of the journal. While one complained of our including "too many books I
                    can't read them all," another turned this apparent problem on its head:
                    "The book reviews are valuable when there is not time to read them completely. Knowing what
                    is available helps one choose something of particular interest or refer titles to friends with
                    particular interests."</p>
            <p>Not surprisingly, time proved the most significant factor in determining the attention a reader can
                    devote to the magazine. Fewer than 10 percent of our readers expressed "no
                    opinion" on the statement, "I glance through the IMH, but don't usually
                    read it carefully." While the majority do read the articles carefully, one–third
                    of our respondents acknowledged being glancers. Four readers expressed a desire for more time to
                    read the articles, and another suggested that shorter articles would be easier to read "in
                    today's fast pace[d] world." One reader skims "to see what's up
                    in the IMH, even when I don't read a whole article," and another notes, similarly,
                    that "If I see an article that catches my interest, I read it… otherwise I skim
                    through." Such selective glancing evidently has its payoffs: "Glancing thru the
                    last issue and not interested in "Bonds' Fraud" article [volume 99] when
                    on p. 28 the name of my Great Grandfather, James Cravens, jumped out. I knew he was in Congress from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Co. but didn't realize he was a state agent in NY for a short period. Thank
                    you!" Finding time to read the IMH is also related to the reader's interest in the
                    topic. "Articles appeal to our personal interests." One reader suggested that the
                    editors provide a description of each article to help assist them in deciding which will merit their
                    time.</p>
            <p>Fortunately for the editors, readers provided ample indication of their interests. Questions six,
                    seven, and nine provided spaces for written comments and hundreds came in.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> The
                    three topics most often mentioned by readers were biography, history, and transportation. Some
                    readers are interested in biographies of "people of note,"
                    "celebrities," "prominent families," "favorite
                    sons," and "interesting characters." Others would prefer a more
                    generalized "biographical approach" that provides information about the
                    "backgrounds" of people and their role as individuals and members of groups. <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi> Questions six, seven, and nine inquired about readers'
                            interest in recent history, neighboring states, and time periods.</item>
               </list>
                    <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-100-1-071"/> Many indicated an interest in "common people,"
                    "everyday unsung people," "man on the street stories" about
                    daily life, and the ways in which people met the demands of situations at hand. In general,
                    readers' interests are summed up by the comment of one respondent who wrote, simply,
                    "People— past and present." Although I will save for later a discussion
                    of people's interest in history, I will note here that the interests mentioned within this
                    broad category included historic sites, museums, and preservation. The third major category,
                    transportation, was represented in frequent requests for work on wilderness trails, river and lake
                    travel, canals, railroads (including electric interurbans), and aviation.</p>
            <p>A second, somewhat less requested cluster of topics includes the areas of religion, migration, local
                    history, genealogy, and military history. Readers called for studies of religious institutions,
                    ideologies, and preachers; for information on specific groups such as the Quakers, Amish,
                    Mennonites, and Shakers; and for more on religion's broader influence on politics,
                    literature, and society. They also expressed interest in learning more about the migration patterns
                    that contributed to Hoosier society, and in seeing more material on specific communities, towns, and
                    counties. Genealogy remains a popular topic, as does military history including especially the Civil
                    War, although readers are interested in twentieth–century conflicts as well.</p>
            <p>Finally, some topics attracted the interest of small numbers of readers. These include: pioneers and
                    settlers, education, colleges and universities, business, industry, manufacturing and labor, Native
                    Americans, women, African Americans, agriculture, architecture, literature, the environment, cities,
                    science and medicine, politics, geography, and archaeology. Several readers who "enjoy
                    coverage (exposure to) topics" encouraged editors to continue to present "a good
                    variety" and to "rotate all of them." One reader appreciates the
                    IMH's "editorial creativity and willingness to address a broad range of topics and
                    cultures," and another remarked that the "quality of research &amp; writing is
                    more important than topic."</p>
            <p>IMH readers expressed as wide a range of ideas about how they want their interests packaged as they
                    did about those interests themselves. Some readers "find the unchanged character of the IMH
                    to be comforting," appreciate its "predictability," or "like IMH
                    as it is" and "hope you don't make any drastic changes." Some
                    warned the editors against "trending toward superficial or politically correct
                    topics," while others urged them not to "equate popularizing history or broadening
                    the readership with dumbing it down." "Be bold," one exhorted the
                    editors, while another counseled just as strongly, "Don't tamper with it after
                    nearly a hundred years of a defined purpose and excellent record."</p>
            <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-100-1-072"/>
            <p>Readers calling for change made a wide variety of suggestions. Some asked for interviews,
                    autobiography, personal or family history; others for transcriptions and annotations of diaries,
                    journals, letters, and documents; others for review essays that place new books in the context of
                    past scholarship; and still others for more themed issues. One recommended an annual article on
                    Indiana historiography, featuring "themes, trends, philosophy, interpretations, leading
                    thinkers, schools of history, and needs and opportunities for research." High school
                    teachers expressed interest in reading reviews of textbooks with Indiana content and in finding
                    suggestions for using the magazine in the classroom. One reader thought "it might be
                    interesting to many of your readers to learn about how an article is researched and
                    written—the process of studying history." There were two requests to involve
                    more Indiana residents in writing articles and reviewing books, and one request to form local
                    interest groups to discuss history. Other suggestions included making the magazine available as a
                    talking book, and in online form.</p>
            <p>Finally, readers advised editors on the physical packaging of the magazine. One counseled editors to
                    "dump the stodgy old red cover and get a new, lively design!" Another reminded,
                    "We do judge our reading materials by their covers." Others called for "a
                    little pizzazz," a "face lift," or a "more dynamic
                    design." To enliven the "almost textbook" layout, several readers called
                    for more pictures, maps, and illustrations to "highlight" and
                    "enhance" text. One respondent was thankful for the inclusion of maps "so
                    I can travel to visit locations." Others called for larger fonts because, as one reader put
                    it, "This is the perfect reading for seniors but who can see it? I am 60 &amp;
                    can't see it. What about my mother who is 95?" Another reader wrote: "I
                    really appreciate your placing the footnotes/reference notes at the bottom of each page rather than
                    at the end of the afticle. Your method allows for faster reading with better
                    comprehension." One reader indicated that external characteristics do not make the
                    magazine: "Don't try to 'fix' it by making it more
                    'reader friendly' i.e. pictures, color, fancy fonts, slick paper. Leave it. Keep
                    the contents interesting and factual and provable. That is the essence of a history
                    magazine."</p>
            <p>"LIKE APPLES AND ORANGES"</p>
            <p>In addition to thinking about the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, the survey also
                    asked readers to compare the magazine to the Indiana Historical Society's companion
                    magazine, <hi rend="i">Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History.</hi> When asked if they enjoy
                    reading one as much as the other, more than half (55.4 <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-100-1-073"/> percent)
                    answered affirmatively, while just under a third (31.4 percent) indicated a preference, and 10.8
                    percent had no opinion. However, the written comments discourage drawing conclusions from the
                    numeric data for this question, as readers who selected the same numeric response wrote conflicting
                        comments.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some readers took the opportunity to express their high opinion of <hi rend="i">Traces:</hi>
                    "I love <hi rend="i">Traces"</hi> wrote one; <hi rend="i">"Traces</hi> is
                    a superb magazine," said another. But just as interestingly, question five served as a
                    prompt for readers to size up their interest in history publications in general, and to comment in
                    particular on the relationship of the IMH and <hi rend="i">Traces.</hi> Dozens of written comments
                    indicate that readers have a sophisticated and integrated approach to their reading of history. One
                    reader indicated that preference depends on the issue, "some months one way some
                    another." Another said that his ideal magazine "would fall between <hi rend="i">Traces</hi> &amp; the IMH but my having to look to both doesn't seem a bad
                    thing." From another, "I enjoy reading both for different reasons—they
                    don't compete and should not be compared." One reader left the question blank and
                    wrote, "the comparison with <hi rend="i">Traces</hi> is like apples and oranges."</p>
            <p>While many readers explicitly preferred one magazine to the other, they agreed that they like having
                    both. One wrote that the complementary magazines well serve readers' "intellectual
                    sophistication and diversity of complex historical experiences." "If you are
                    considering diverting your format to include that of <hi rend="i">Traces"</hi> another
                    warned, "you should consider ceasing. <hi rend="i">Traces</hi> established itself precisely
                    against your format. … [S]erve the audience for which <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> is
                    founded."</p>
            <p>"BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT <hi rend="i">INDIANA</hi> AND ABOUT <hi rend="i">HISTORY"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Readers' comments reveal a variety of responses to the two words that anchor the
                    magazine's name: Indiana and history. Of those readers who volunteered an opinion on the
                    statement that they "would be interested in reading more about Indiana's
                    neighboring states," 62.8 percent disagreed while <list type="footnotes">

                            also wrote in comments indicating different interpretations of the question. One wrote,
                            "love both"; another wrote, "more," next to the
                            reference to <hi rend="i">Traces;</hi> others rewrote the question to read "more
                            than," or "much more," or "better than <hi rend="i">Traces."</hi> A reader who responded negatively to the question chose
                            "no opinion," and then wrote in "enjoy <hi rend="i">Traces</hi>
                            the most."</item>

                    <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-100-1-074"/> 37.2 percent agreed. "Do not do this!," one
                    wrote, "Seems like an Indiana History publication should confine itself to
                    Indiana." Other readers mentioned that they "would read a different
                    publication" or "join that state's society if interested,"
                    reminding editors, "It's not their history we're paying to read
                    about." One in five respondents listed no opinion or left the question unanswered.</p>
            <p>Still, a significant minority of respondents expressed an interest in reading about the history of
                    other states—with conditions. Nearly three hundred do want to read about other states in
                    the Midwest, states that border Indiana or are within driving distance. Some felt that any state
                    once part of Indiana or the Old Northwest was acceptable. More than two dozen respondents emphasized
                    that, while the magazine's focus should remain on Indiana, there was value to discussing
                    issues in the context of the larger region. But there were definite limits. "We belong, and
                    read," one reader emphasized, "to get INDIANA history."</p>
            <p>If there was one question on the survey that most divided readers it was question six, which asked
                    readers to agree or disagree with the statement: "I would like to see the <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> publish more research on present–day Indiana." One in four readers
                    registered no opinion or left the question unanswered, while 38.5 percent disagreed and 32.5 percent
                    agreed. Several readers reminded editors that "H" stands for
                    "History" and that the present is not history. One reader asked if it was a
                    "joke question," while another wrote simply, "no, No, NO." These
                    readers felt the editors should "leave recent topics to magazines and newspapers,"
                    that recent events are "interesting but should be in Traces or similar journal,"
                    and "if I wanted to find out about current events I would not be taking the IM of
                    History!"</p>
            <p>Since readers express (and pay money for) their interest in history, it might be appropriate to ask
                    them to define history and "the past." One reader wrote, "This question
                    is perplexing," and dozens of others felt similarly provoked to state their views about
                    what is too recent and what constitutes the past. From their comments emerge some common themes
                    about how we define the past and distinguish it from the present.</p>
            <p>One adjective used by readers to describe the past is that it is "pure" but could
                    be "diluted" by "interpretation" or "articles on other
                    states that don't include Indiana." Other readers described the past as a place of
                    truth, of substance, a place where "facts" reside and have "lasting
                    importance." Good history is, therefore, "factual and provable." This
                    past can be "corrupted" by "partisan politics," by
                    "propaganda," or by the "slanted bias in contemporary media and
                    academia." When the pure past is diluted or the true past is corrupted, it becomes
                    "what we have lost."</p>
            <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-100-1-075"/>
            <p>For these respondents, the past is clearly distinct from the present. It is a different place, a
                    foreign place, a place that people in the present do not fully understand. Because "I
                    can't step into a time machine and go back," implored one reader, "let
                    someone who was there tell me!" "Let the people talk, they know more than present
                    day researchers," wrote another. One reader insisted that contemporary concerns and ways of
                    thinking are "esoteric" and have no place in a historical journal. From the
                    perspective of such readers, the past is made of "nonsociological stuff," is
                    "less social, economical, and political," and is, well, just "more
                    historical."</p>
            <p>Many of our readers are eager to read stories about real people who "met the demands of the
                    situation at hand" and helped to "provide the needs of the community."
                    These stories can be "brought to life" and "kept alive" by
                    historians who are "fun," or "interesting and engaging." This
                    living past centers on places that can be visited, on objects in museums, and in documents in
                    libraries.</p>
            <p>Readers recommended several ways to distinguish "past" from
                    "recent." Some distinguished the two by date or event, although they disagreed on
                    the appropriate cut–off point. "Remember history is about the past,"
                    wrote one, "not last month or last year." When does the past become history? For
                    one respondent, events that happened before the <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> War are historical. Others specified a quarter of a century, a third, one hundred years
                    ago or more, while a fourth reader set the standard at "prior to 1900." Other
                    readers were not so strict, arguing that history should explore "much [of the] twentieth
                    century," should "not stop at World War II," or should include
                    "the 1960s onward."</p>
            <p>Obviously, distinguishing past from present is a dicey business, and readers puzzled over its
                    complexities. One felt that the years from the 1950s through the 1970s are
                    "recent," but allowed that readers too young to have experienced the time period,
                    and even those a little older, needed help "to refresh memories." Another added
                    that "it takes time and distance to create an historical perspective—time for
                    documentation to become available— time to assess real significance, time to put some
                    distance to contemporary political &amp; cultural pressures &amp; prejudices."
                    Still others saw this shifting perspective as further reason to include recent events:
                    "Some contemporary issues should be included because in the future they could be more
                    reliable than research writers. Time tends to temper or drastically change events. Somewhat like the
                    game of telling stories and how the story changes as it goes around a circle of people."</p>
            <p>Generally speaking, readers felt safest pushing the past farther back in time. Question nine listed a
                    handful of loosely defined time periods—Native <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-100-1-076"/>

               </table> American and frontier period, Civil War, the Gilded Age and early twentieth century, the
                    Great Depression and the postwar era, and the recent past—and asked readers to rank them
                    in order of interest. There is a direct correlation between distance from the present and number of
                    votes, as well as a direct correspondence between recentness and number of unselected periods. In
                    other words, the longer ago the time period, the more likely it was to get a vote (Table 2).</p>
            <p>The comments of a number of readers taken together suggest three strategies for connecting the
                    distant past with recent years and with the <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-100-1-077"/> present. The first
                    is to view the present as "history in the making" and to learn about
                    "todays history makers." Another approach is to draw comparisons between the past
                    and present in order to show progress or growth. Such comparisons might be educational if drawn
                    "between historical events and current events—like the anti–German
                    attitudes of the world wars compared to the current anti–Middle East attitudes."
                    A third strategy would, more generally, highlight "the impact and contemporary
                    relevance" of the past by examining contemporary issues "from a historical
                    standpoint" and "trading] how Indiana evolved into the twenty–first
                    century"; such an approach might answer such questions as how the "past affect [s]
                    current state policy," or why Hoosiers are "so conservative."</p>
            <p>Finally, readers expressed a natural interest in relating their own lives, and the lives of their
                    families, to the past. When asked if they would like to learn more about local history activities,
                    nearly three–quarters of the respondents said yes, while 14 percent had no opinion.
                    Dozens of written comments listed the names of the respondents ancestors and asked that something be
                    written about them. One respondent wrote, "History begins with [my ancestor]!"
                    Others shared tidbits about their families and offered their family papers for historical research.
                    A few requested articles guiding readers to "resources available to do genealogical and
                    historical research," or "that deal with the historic events that impact the study
                    of genealogy."</p>
            <p>From this perspective it comes as no surprise that a reader in Gary wants more articles on cities,
                    that a reader in Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> would like to see a greater emphasis on the history of northern Indiana, that an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> resident requests more on <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName>, or that Hoosiers collectively ask for more about "my home state."
                    Perhaps these connections can be explored in sophisticated and scholarly ways that avoid what one
                    reader described as "a tendency during the last few years of reverting to the type of
                    'this is what my granddaddy or other illustrious ancestor did in the old days'
                    article." One respondent summed up the attitude of countless others by writing,
                    "Please remember that we request <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine oj History</hi> because it
                    is about Indiana and about History."</p>
            <p>What is it, then, that unites the vastly different points of view that <hi rend="i">1MH</hi> readers
                    bring to the magazine? Perhaps it is a shared sense that the IMH is "scholarly,"
                    "academic," "detailed," and "documented," that
                    it is "educational and worthwhile," that it helps them "to understand
                    what shaped our getting to where we are," and that "it brings research to the
                    general public." The IMH, most seem to agree, "serves an important role in
                    publishing well–researched scholarly papers," and "is an excellent
                    source of information," "a stimulus" for those who are interested in
                    learning about, connecting with, <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-100-1-078"/> and sharing Indiana's
                    past. Some readers "keep every copy forever" while others, perhaps drawing on this
                    sense of the journal's public value, donate their copies to libraries or schools for wider
                    circulation. Respondents recommended that the magazine be placed "in every city or county
                    library" in the state, and that it be read and appreciated by "younger busy
                    people" who might otherwise lose touch with their past. Perhaps the ultimate expression of
                    Hoosier pride came from the reader whose comment serves, as well as any, to summarize the results of
                    our inquiry: "not perfect, but better than other states'." It is, wrote
                    another reader, an "important record of Indiana's past."</p>

            <p>On his deathbed in 1879, Brigadier General Jefferson C. Davis journeyed back in memory to his service
                    under fire at Fort Sumter in April 1861. Although an undeniably dramatic episode, it was only one
                    among many in an unusually eventful life. As a teenage volunteer from Indiana in the Mexican War,
                    Davis distinguished himself on the field at Buena Vista (although another Jefferson Davis was
                    propelled further by his actions there). After Sumter, he saw action on such far–flung
                    battlefields as Pea Ridge and Chicka–mauga, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Bentonville, in most cases commanding a division. The immediate postwar period
                    found him ensconced in the Alaskan town of Sitka's vast Baranoff Castle, as military
                    governor of the newly purchased territory. Later, Davis zealously prosecuted the Modoc War of
                    1872–1873 near the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>–<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> border, and saw his opponent, the Modoc chieftain Kintpuash (known to whites as Captain
                    Jack), shackled and sent to the gallows. Two events, however, overshadowed all the others:
                    Davis's killing of a fellow Union general in 1862, and his abandonment to a dubious fate of
                    a large number of contraband slaves during 1864's March to the Sea. Although, due to a
                    series of flukes, he was not court–martialled for the former incident, it doomed any hope
                    of advancement, which he would have otherwise abundantly merited. The latter incident, in
                    "providing convincing evidence of his prejudice against an innocent people and his deeply
                    ingrained <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-100-1-080"/> inhumanity" (p. 314), made it certain that
                    Congress would never approve a future promotion.</p>
            <p>These actions apparently sullied Davis's reputation to the extent that no
                    full–scale biography of this obviously significant figure has appeared until now.
                    Happily, Davis's biographers— esteemed historian Nathaniel Cheairs Hughes, Jr.,
                    and Davis expert Gordon D. Whitney—have proven themselves perfectly suited for the task.
                    They have produced a definitive study, one that is exhaustively researched, carefully interpreted,
                    and engagingly written.</p>
            <p>In the preface the authors telegraph their intent to avoid whitewashing their subject. Readers
                    expecting an indulgent explanation for the killing of Major General William Nelson, for example, are
                    warned that Davis was guilty as charged. Although Hughes and Whitney show appreciation for
                    Davis's commendable qualities, from the honesty of his post–action reports to
                    his talents as a "no–nonsense military administrator" (p. 361), they
                    emphasize the gravity of his choices and actions in the Nelson shooting. Note for instance their
                    terse summary of Davis's involvement in the execution of Captain Jack for killing Brigadier
                    General Edward R. S. Canby: "A murderer executed by another murderer" (p. 413).</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, Davis is not an unsympathetic or unattractive figure, and is certainly a colorful one
                    (his language no less blue than his uniform). Despite his distinguished record in the Mexican War,
                    he was denied the West Point appointment that even President James Knox Polk thought he deserved. He
                    was nevertheless commissioned in the regular Army, and rose to become one of Indiana's
                    notorious, rather than famous, Civil War generals. Although small, frail, and sickly, he performed
                    spectacularly on many fields of battle. Major General William T. Sherman recognized his worth:
                    "Here was a man who could handle a block of infantry with the effectiveness of cavalry,
                    with no excuses or cries for reinforcement. He could make an independent decision without detailed
                    instructions and without having been provided a full ration of intelligence, the mark of a strong,
                    decisive commander" (p. 248). Of Davis's many military successes, the authors
                    focus on two from the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, followed by a "bold thrust in heavy double lines" (p. 287).</p>
            <p>Undeniably definitive, <hi rend="i">Jefferson Davis in Blue</hi> only barely misses being fully
                    exemplary as well. Its major fault lies in its index—there is no entry for the
                    book's subject. What goes before, however, is extraordinarily good. The narrative, superbly
                    documented and mercifully free of hackneyed phrases and stale allusions, flows briskly and clearly.
                    Balanced and judicious, the book gives a fair hearing, and justice, to one of the Civil
                    War's most controversial figures.</p>

            <p>In <hi rend="i">For Gold and Glory</hi>, Todd Gould tells the story of race–car driver
                    Charlie Wiggins and the African–American racing car circuit that he invigorated between
                    1924 and 1936. Although the auto–racing establishment barred African Americans from its
                    events, including the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> 500, Wiggins's skills as a mechanic and driver were critical in forging the
                    Gold and Glory Sweepstakes—the premiere event of the African–American racing
                    circuit, held in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Wiggins's perseverance and talents reflected the broader values that African
                    Americans used to fight against discrimination and the Ku Klux Klan that was coming to dominate
                    statewide politics even as Wiggins and his fellow black drivers built a successful racing circuit.
                    As black racers crisscrossed the Midwest, they demonstrated that neither the revitalized KKK nor
                    most racing organizations (such as the American Automobile Association) could prevent African
                    Americans from creating a vibrant and influential racing culture.</p>
            <p>Gould pulls together a variety of sources and tells his story primarily by quoting at great length
                    (frequently for entire paragraphs) interviews with professional and amateur historians, the
                    recollections of Wiggins's proteges, or the accounts of newspaper reporters. Although this
                    mode of storytelling works exceptionally well in the world of filmmaking, an area where Gould has
                    won many awards, it does not work quite as well as the primary storytelling device in a written
                    biography.</p>
            <p>As Gould asserts the influence of Wiggins's driving and mechanical skills on the racing
                    world, he touches upon important questions about the role of African Americans in the history of
                    sport and automobile culture. Gould suggests that Wiggins's tremendous impact on racing was
                    due to the multiracial fraternity he created in his garage—"Charlie's
                    Gang," as they were known—which included black and white drivers, mechanics, and
                    automobile aficionados. Indeed, during the 1930s Wiggins mentored five of the top ten Indy 500
                    drivers. Although Wiggins's impact seems to have been considerable, the outlines and
                    broader significance of his accomplishments remain fuzzy. A number of questions are never fully
                    answered: What were <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-100-1-082"/> Wiggins's innovations and precisely
                    how did they change racing culture? Who emulated them and why were they improvements? Also, how was
                    it possible to create such an interracial culture of male camaraderie at a time of deep racial
                    divisions? Was it simply the result of a shared passion for racing?</p>
            <p>Gould argues that a brotherhood of racing transcended racial boundaries, noting especially
                    Wiggins's work with Indy 500 winner "Wild Bill" Cummings. Cummings had
                    been part of "Charlie's Gang" and learned much about racing from the
                    black driver. In fact, Wiggins served on Cummings's pit crew the year he won the 500. Yet,
                    because AAA officials would not allow the use of a black mechanic or pit crew, Cummings hired
                    Charlie Wiggins as a janitor. Only after sweeping the floors, and after officials had left the track
                    was Charlie allowed to help craft the winning car. Amazingly, though perhaps not surprisingly,
                    Cummings never publicly acknowledged or thanked Wiggins for his work. Even so, Gould argues that
                    this story showed that "behind those garage doors, there was no color line, no race, and no
                    barriers to overcome."</p>
            <p>I would have interpreted this story differently. Cummings and white drivers clearly benefited from
                    the exceptional skills of black drivers, but that they did so without allowing them into their
                    fraternity speaks volumes. Cummings did not "shatter social norms." Rather, on his
                    way to victory, Cummings exploited a phenomenally talented black American, and then did not
                    recognize his labor or talent. This is the story of African Americans writ large. Like other black
                    Americans, Wiggins battled long odds to shape his sport and attempted to carve out a
                    multi–racial and more equitable world, only to be forgotten because of the entrenched
                    racism of society and racing culture. Fortunately, Todd Gould has brought the story of Charlie
                    Wiggins and the African–American racing circuit to light.</p>

                    </placeName> Quakerism, frontier home medicinal practices, and the roles of women's,
                    family, and community labor in antebellum agricultural societies. They are also notable for their
                    rare references to farming during the Midwest's canal–building era.</p>
            <p>In 1826 Joseph and Anna Bentley, their six children, and a black servant named Henry left <placeName>

                    </placeName>, where they entered a world of unrelenting, "slavish" labor.
                    Anna's letters routinely describe the litany of chores that comprise "a most
                    laborious" day or week, along with their physical efforts upon her, sometimes expressing
                    solace only in the realization that part of her next day's labor can be done while seated.
                    For example, after noting that she had washed, baked, scoured, and cooked,
                    "&amp;c," Bentley remarks that "I have been constantly on my feet;
                    and I feel very tired now and look forward to tomorrow as a treat, for I have a great pile of
                    patching to do that I can set down to" (p. 40). Especially revealing are her
                    characterizations of family and neighbor labor, which formed the most salient feature of pioneer
                    interconnected–ness (followed by caring for the sick, grieving with the mourning, and
                    attending to the young). While the division of labor tended to be along gender lines,
                    Bentley's letters also document that these lines frequently blurred according to the needs
                    of the moment. Pioneers prized labor for its contribution to the whole while disparaging the
                    "good for nothing"; this is evident whether Anna writes with pride about
                    eight–year–old Maria's capabilities or about her own limitations
                    during her thirteen pregnancies.</p>
            <p>The regional landscape of independent farms that Anna's family helped to create was quite
                    dependent upon a western culture of neighborly assistance and obligation. Apparently Bentley was
                    unaccustomed to this form of community labor. Commenting on the scarcity of money that prompted
                    payment in kind, she writes that it is the "custom here in harvest or other busy times to
                    collect as many neighbors as they can, and they will pay back in work" (p. 38). Neighboring
                    women collaborated to provide food for the hands. She notes numerous other labor arrangements such
                    as engaging one man to plow and sow their flax field in return for granting him his own small
                    section, or the employment of a neighbor's teenage daughter for domestic chores in exchange
                    for educational or social instruction. All was not harmonious, however; Anna writes with disgust
                    about those who failed to assist, the family's stolen beehive, and the frequency of
                    lawsuits to obtain a payment of debt.</p>
            <p>So much more can be gleaned from these remarkable letters. Given Bent–ley's own
                    excommunication over a doctrinal <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-100-1-084"/> dispute, they are less about
                    Quakerism than they are about western pioneering—a point Foster, as editor, fails to
                    develop. Conspicuously missing from her bibliography is R. Douglas Hurt's illuminating work

            <p>For much of the nation's past, needlework has been an integral part of women's
                    lives. Women used needlework as a way to tell stories, to highlight what was important to them, and
                    to reveal their aesthetic sensibilities and technical prowess. Samplers, a particularly popular form
                    of needlework during the early nineteenth century, are the focus of <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName> is My Dwelling Place.</hi> Like all documents, samplers can be looked at in many
                    different ways. On a visual level they can be appreciated for their use of color, design, skill, and
                    composition. As heirlooms, they are treasures valued for family ties, for a link to the past, and
                    for their relative scarcity. As social documents, samplers provide information on opportunities
                    available to young women and on the wider cultural environment at a particular point in time. Sue
                    Studebaker, a needlework connoisseur and researcher, provides a peek into the needlework creations
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s young pioneer women.</p>
            <p>This study of samplers in early nineteenth–century <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> is the result of what has become familiar in the quilt world, a statewide documentation
                    project. Studebaker and a number of other enthusiasts uncovered samplers, researched young
                    needleworkers and <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-100-1-085"/> their educational backgrounds, and then placed
                    the needlework and the young stitchers within the settlement patterns of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. The project has documented more than three hundred samplers. Because of this effort,
                    we know more about the nature of needlework in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and the importance of the needle arts in the education of young women. Such a statewide
                    quilt documentation project, once underway, triggers interest in the traditions of other states;
                    each project therefore helps shape the structure of nascent efforts in other places.</p>
            <p>The study begins with a general discussion of the territorial and early statehood history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, paying particular attention to migration patterns. Next, Studebaker builds on the work
                    of other needlework scholars and discusses the importance of needlework in the education of young
                    women, as well as touching briefly on the role that the samplers they produced played in their
                    lives. She concludes this brief introductory section with a consideration of what makes a sampler an "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>" sampler.</p>
            <p>Studebaker divides <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> into three sampler regions—southern, central, and northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>—and within each section explores sampler production county by county. After
                    a brief introduction to the county, selected young women and their samplers are discussed. Attention
                    is paid to their families, their education, and their needlework. Crisp color and
                    black–and–white photographs provide an opportunity to examine the samplers.
                    The text offers an explanation of the motifs and influences of each selection and details the family
                    and educational environment of the needleworkers. The volume concludes with a listing of all
                    documented samplers and a chart of those schools and teachers identified over the course of the
                    project.</p>
            <p>While this study is one of the first to bring the systematic examination of samplers from its
                    previous focus on the east coast to the Midwest, and while it communicates enthusiasm for the
                    possibilities of statewide sampler documentation, it falls short of the more sophisticated
                    quilt–documentation projects. The best of the publications resulting from these projects
                    clearly indicate the multiple goals involved in the documentation effort. These include an interest
                    in encouraging greater appreciation of quilts as folk art, the collection of information on quilters
                    and quilts, the establishment of a repository for material gathered during the life of the project,
                    and the promotion of quilt conservation and preservation. If such goals existed for this sampler
                    project, no mention is made of their existence. Without an identified repository for the information
                    generated during the project, the book serves as the only and hence, limited record of what the
                    research efforts uncovered. Finally, this volume fails to place its educational information within
                    the context of larger discussions of frontier and antebellum education history. This contextual
                    vacuum significantly weakens the study's overall authority.</p>

            <p>With this book George W Hilton has created another detailed analysis of a portion of the history and
                    technology of the Great Lakes transportation industry. One of his earliest books, The <hi rend="i">Great Lakes Car Ferries</hi> (1962), took a detailed look at every aspect of that service, and
                    is today recognized as the definitive work on the subject. In the same vein, he wrote The <hi rend="i">Night Boat</hi> (1968), about overnight passenger steamer service. <hi rend="i">
                  <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> Passenger Steamers</hi> provides a close look at the
                    boats that for a century provided passenger and package–freight service across the lake.
                    Hilton notes in the present work that the first letter he received after the car–ferry
                    book appeared was from Edward N. Middleton. This is perhaps fitting, since over the two decades that
                    Middleton worked in maritime history it was his dream to see published a book on <geogName>Lake
                        Michigan</geogName> passenger steamers.</p>
            <p>This book provides far more detail than the title might indicate. The first part treats the industry
                    as a whole, looking at the geography, the boats themselves, the demands for service, and changing
                    transportation technology The second part looks at the individual companies that provided passenger
                    service on <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName>. (It should be noted that this book is dedicated to
                    firms that provided service primarily on <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName>; lines that provided
                    service throughout the Great Lakes are mentioned only peripherally.) The book is profusely
                    illustrated with pictures and drawings covering the entire era of passenger service.</p>
            <p>Captain Albert E. Goodrich established the largest and longest–lived of the <geogName>Lake
                        Michigan</geogName> passenger lines, the Goodrich Transit Company, which operated from 1856
                    until it failed during the Great Depression. He chartered his –first boat, the <hi rend="i">Huron</hi>, for service between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Milwaukee. As his firm expanded it provided service to virtually every port on the
                    lake. By the turn of the century, the firm provided scheduled service to nine major ports, with a

                    services to excursionists making extended visits. As the twentieth century dawned, business expanded
                    annually with finer vessels and faster service, until a quarter of a million excursionists were

                    Great Lakes shipping. Other factors included the coming of the automobile, efficient highway
                    transportation, new government regulations, and the Great Depression, all combining to bring on the
                    demise. The <hi rend="i">Theodore Roosevelt</hi> was withdrawn in 1951 after failing boiler and

            <p>"Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old only by deserting
                    their ideals." Perhaps the words of General Douglas MacArthur help to explain why historian
                    and centenarian Thomas D. Clark has withstood the years so well. The former long–time
                    chair of the history department at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> has not deserted his great ideal: the notion that the knowledge of history remains as
                    practicable and useful <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-100-1-088"/> today as a full grasp of the Internet.
                    Clark remains physically active, speaking to audiences and writing. His mind and his eloquence seem
                    to be sharpened by the passage of time. The essence of his incredibly varied and productive life has
                    been captured wonderfully in <hi rend="i">Thomas D. Clark of <placeName>

            <p>Born in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
               </placeName>, on July 13, 1903, the oldest of seven siblings, Clark is
                    the son of a cotton farmer but was greatly influenced by his schoolteacher mom. His hard life in the
                    cotton fields under the searing <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> sun, as well as his early experiences logging and working as a deckhand on a dredging
                    boat, gave him first–hand knowledge of the rigors of rural labor.</p>
            <p>After earning degrees at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> and the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, Clark culminated his formal learning with a doctorate from Duke University. In 1931 he
                    arrived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to begin his illustrious career with the University of <placeName>

            <p>Hoosier readers should feel a special affinity for Clark. While his life study has been on southern
                    history, primarily <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, he spent four years teaching at Indiana University after retiring from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> school in 1968. He was wooed to the appointment as Distinguished Service Professor
                    Emeritus at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> by IUs president, Elvis Stahr, a former student of his and a native Kentuckian. While
                    at Indiana, Clark made a lasting contribution to the state by writing a comprehensive
                    four–volume history of Indiana University in which he traced the university's
                    rise from a small school to a national institution. One reviewer predicted that this work would be
                    regarded as a superior history of an American institution of higher learning.</p>
            <p>One comes away from Kleber's book dizzy from the long litany of posts and positions Clark
                    has held, and his seemingly limitless list of publications. He has written more on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, including a classic history textbook, than any other person.</p>
            <p>Compilations of essays by multiple authors have a way of running people off; prospective readers may
                    rightly suspect that such works lack the connecting sinew needed to sustain a longer read. Such was
                    my apprehension when I picked up Kleber's book, but it turned out to be a delightful
                    surprise. Kleber's superb editing makes the book flow with the constant stream of a novel.
                    While there is some repetition and overlap, it is minimal and serves only to drive home
                    Clark's accomplishments.</p>
            <p>In arranging the book into five separate categories—"The Life,"
                    "The Historian," "The Advocate," "The Friend,"
                    and "The Works"—Kleber shows that Clark is not only a man of intellect
                    but also a man of action. Among his accomplishments are the development of various projects such as
                    the <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>—is a brainchild of Clark's.</p>
            <p>You need not be a serious student of history, or an admirer of Clark, to find matters of interest in
                    this book. Clark's life itself is interesting. Erudite as he is, he is not a slave to
                    academia. <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-100-1-089"/> His love of history is interwoven with his love of
                    life. Through the reports of eighteen excellent writers from varied backgrounds, this book puts in
                    perspective Clark's life and contributions much better than would a conventional biography.</p>

            <p>Within the covers of this nicely illustrated book lies a typical story of
                    nineteenth–century pioneer "courage, faith, and determination"
                    (p.vii)—with a twenty–first century twist. Brian Hasler, who lives in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> area, imagines a day in the future when his now toddler son comes home from school
                    baffled by the arrival of a Costa Rican immigrant. The son's questions spark the
                    father's recital of an adventure involving "sailing ships, stagecoaches,
                    riverboats, and covered wagons," with a moral for a modern "nation of
                    immigrants." Truesdell's introduction outlines the place of such family
                    "legends" and Baer's afterword shows how modern–day
                    genealogist–"detectives" track a family in census and vital records. If
                    you are a descendant of Casper and Catherine, this is a must–own. If not, it will
                    interest your children and may even inspire you to write your own family history.</p>

            <p>During the first years of the twentieth century Ben Winans, a printer from the small town
                    ofBrookville, Indiana, took up the hobby (later the business) of photography This volume reproduces
                    several dozen of Winans's best photographs and, in so doing, offers a glimpse of midwestem
                    small–town life during the first two decades of the 1900s. In addition to the usual
                    formal portraits and pictures of buildings, churches, schools, and streets, Winan photographed
                    scenes from the lives of the townspeople. He captured the local marching band in the town's
                    1902 Decoration Day parade; men lined up to vote at the Hose Company No. 5 firehouse; a traveling
                    salesman for "J. R. Watkins Medical Co."; a family reunion in the park on a summer
                    day; and a 1907 sharpshooter performing in the "Buckskin Ben" Wild West show.
                    Winans also captured the harsher realities of life, especially in a series of photos taken during
                    the devastation of a 1913 flood.</p>

            <p>In 1947 the Indiana Historical Society began a project to identify all farms in Indiana owned by the
                    same family for one hundred years. The centennial farm project proved so popular with the public
                    that it continued until 1951, by which time more than 1,650 farms had been identified. Tapping into
                    this potentially rich source for rural history and state genealogy, the society has republished the
                    original list of farms, arranged by last name of the original family and also including information
                    on the county in which the farm lies, the date of the farms beginning, and the name of the
                    descendant who submitted the farm for consideration. Along with this extensive list, which takes up
                    more than one–half of the book's length, the IHS press has included a brief
                    introductory essay on the original gathering project and an excellent longer essay by M. Teresa Baer
                    covering the history of agriculture in Indiana. For the use of modern researchers, <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-100-1-092"/> two more indexes, to the last names of farm family descendants and to
                    counties, are included at the end of the book. This liberally illustrated, well–produced
                    volume will appeal particularly to historians of rural Indiana and to genealogists.</p>

            <p>A member of the board of governors of the Society of Indiana Pioneers, Doris Leistner has selected
                    numerous historical articles from the society's newsletters and presented them in
                    chronological order, although some do not include the date of original publication or author. The
                    articles taken together tell at least three stories: one about the experiences of Indiana's
                    nineteenth–century pioneers that were passed on to posterity, another about the way
                    twentieth–. century Hoosiers have celebrated their pioneer ancestors, and another about
                    the meetings and "pilgrimages" taken by twentieth–century society
                    members.</p>

            <p>This thoroughly researched work gives a detailed account of the Indiana Central Canal project and how
                    its initial failure was ultimately transformed into a success. Bakken begins by examining the
                    history of the canal during most of the nineteenth century: its builders, its many sellers and
                    buyers, its uses as transportation, recreation, and water power, and finally its purchase by the <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-100-1-093"/>

                    integral part of the IWC's water–supply system and how, at the end of the
                    twentieth century it was transformed again into an important element in the

                                    1890–1960," published in the June 2002 issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, I read this article with great interest.</p>
                        <p>My father, Herbert William Laffoon, Sr., was born and raised in the city of <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, Indiana, at a time when Indiana was controlled to a great extent by
                                    the KKK. After much negotiation with the coach at what was then Wiley High School
                                    (1924), he became, in his junior year, the first African American to play football
                                    in the city of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>

                                    as "All State." He was the first fullback to be named as
                                    "All State." I mention my father because he experienced the same
                                    racial discrimination associated with his activities (sports) that the author
                                    mentioned were experienced by African Americans at the college level. An article

                                    discrimination encountered by my father when his Wiley High School was to play
