            <p>Advertising and publicity of diesel automobiles during the last decade sometimes have made the diesel
                    engine appear to be a new technology. Diesel engines, however, have been manufactured in Indiana
                    since the horse-and-buggy days. From a shaky start in the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s, diesel engine
                    manufacturing has grown into one of Indiana's largest industries. More heavy-duty diesels
                    of the type used in trucks and industrial machinery are built in Indiana than in all the rest of the <placeName>

            <p>The principles of the diesel engine were conceived by Dr. Rudolf Diesel, a German engineer who

                    </placeName> for his design of a compression-ignition, internal combustion engine in 1892. In 1893
                    Diesel publicized the theory behind his new engine in a paper entitled "Theory and

                    Diesel's theory began with the fact that air temperature rises when air is compressed in an
                    engine cylinder. If the air was compressed to a high pressure, Diesel thought, it would become hot
                    enough to ignite the fuel without using a spark or any other igniter. To avoid a premature explosion
                    of the fuel it would be introduced into the cylinder after the compression of the air was completed.
                    Diesel postulated that if the rate of fuel injection was controlled, the fuel would be burned at a
                    constant pressure and any extremely high pressures in the engine cylinder would be avoided.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Diesel's first two experimental engines were failures. In 1897, however, he succeeded in
                    building an engine that produced 17.8 horsepower at 154 revolutions per minute while working with
                    Maschinenfabrik Augsburg (now Machinenfabrik Augsburg-Nurnberg or MAN). Although heavy and bulky for
                    the amount of power developed, Diesel's engine was twice as efficient as other contemporary
                    internal combustion engines. In 1898, Diesel's licensees, MAN, Krupp, and Deutz, marketed
                    twenty-horsepower diesel engines. That same year Adolphus Busch, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> brewer, acquired the North American rights to the diesel, and the first American-built
                    diesel engine was installed in the Busch brewery.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Diesel's early engines the fuel was injected into the engine cylinder with a blast of
                    air, a method that required a bulky air compressor apparatus that absorbed 7 percent of the
                    engine's developed power and added to its complexity. Diesel soon began work on other
                    injection schemes, and with the expiration of his patents in 1907 other inventors also began to
                    search for simpler means of injecting the fuel. The goal then and through the early decades of the
                    twentieth century was to find a method whereby the fuel could be introduced into the cylinder more
                    rapidly. A more rapid introduction of fuel would increase engine speed which in turn would permit
                    the development of engines which were both more powerful and smaller and lighter.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>Most of the early injection schemes involved the use of a cup, called a precombustion chamber,
                    located next to the cylinder and connected to it with one or more holes. A measured amount of fuel
                    was metered into the cup during the engine's air intake stroke. As the air was compressed
                    in the cylinder during the compression stroke, some of it passed through the hole or holes into the
                    cup and vaporized the light fractions of the fuel. At the top of the piston stroke the air became
                    hot enough to ignite the vapor thereby causing an explosion in the cup which drove the remainder of
                    the fuel into the engine cylinder where the main combustion took place.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of the most promising of these early precombustion systems was patented by Jan Brons, founder of
                    present-day Brons Industrie of Appledam, The Netherlands. When properly adjusted the Brons engine
                    operated on a true diesel cycle with constant pressure during combustion. This fact made it a smooth
                    running engine. Rasmus M. Hvid, a Dane, obtained the U.S. rights to the Brons
                    engine—probably as Brons's agent—and began to license American
                    companies to build oil engines, as diesels were then called.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Brons/Hvid engine was probably the first diesel engine seen in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a city where more than a million diesel engines would eventually be made. The engine
                    was installed in the Schaefer and Schwartzkopf flour mill at Third and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> streets in 1915. In an article in the <hi rend="i">Evening Republican</hi> it was
                    described as "a strange new engine" that had no ignition system and burned
                    "any kind of fuel that will run." Called an H and O engine, it was built in St.
                    Marys, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. The engine could generate sixty horsepower and was about the size of a gasoline
                    engine. This early diesel engine the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>

                    horsepower designed by Hans L. Knudsen, chief engineer of the St. Marys Machine Company and later a
                    major figure in the development of the Cummins diesel engine.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>While the diesel engine was undergoing these early developments, two chains of events began in

                    thirty-two thousand square foot, three-story brick factory at the intersection of Morton Avenue and
                    the Southern Railroad tracks. The company's first buggy was completed on January 31, 1903.
                    The nucleus of the work force was forty executives and craftsmen that McCurdy brought with him from
                    Brighton. Additional workers were hired in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> as the business expanded. Skilled craftsmen were paid $3.00 to
                    $4.00 a day; laborers, about $1.75. Hercules made all of the parts for the
                    buggies and other vehicles except for the axles and springs, which were purchased from Hess Spring
                    and Axle Company of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Carthage</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, a company owned by Mc-Curdy's
                        father-in-law.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Most of Hercules vehicles were sold to Sears, Roebuck and
                    Company for resale through their mail-order catalogue, although Hercules also sold through other
                    channels.</p>
            <p>During the next decade the buggy company expanded rapidly and in 1912 was recapitalized at
                    $1.5 million. Also the Hercules Body Company (1906) and the Hercules Wheel Company (1909)
                    were incorporated as separate entities but with essentially the same ownership, McCurdy being the
                    principal owner.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    was established to make bodies for automobiles marketed by Sears. Later the company also built
                    bodies for post office trucks, for commercial trucks, and for military trucks used during World War

            <p>In 1908 Sears, Roebuck began to sell gasoline engines of two to ten horsepower for farm and other
                    uses. These engines were marketed under the Sears trade name Economy. Sears's 1910 fall
                    catalogue stated, "We own and operate our own gasoline engine factory," but
                    another, later source indicates that the engines were built for Sears by the Sparta Gas Engine
                    Company of Sparta, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Whatever their origins, Sears became dissatisfied with the
                    quality and cost of the engines and asked Hercules to manufacture a line of gasoline engines for
                    them.</p>
            <p>In response to this request the Hercules Gas Engine Company was organized in 1913 with a
                    capitalization of two hundred fifty thousand dollars. A new factory eight hundred feet long and one
                    hundred fifty feet wide was built to produce the engines. The factory manager of this engine plant
                    was Vincent E. McMullen, who later would become an executive of Cummins Engine Company. In its 1915
                    fall catalogue Sears stated, "we just recently built [this new factory] at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Ind., for the manufacture of our new Improved Model Economy Engines." The new
                    factory was a success. It produced three hundred fifty thousand engines in its first eight years.
                    Most of these engines were marketed through Sears, but Hercules also sold some of the engines
                    directly to other customers.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometime after the Economy engines went into production at the Hercules factory, W. M. Tippett,
                    manager of Sears's engine department, concluded that there was a market for oil engines in
                    rural America because these engines could run on kerosene, which was more available than gasoline in
                    rural areas. Consequently, Tippett obtained a license for Sears from R. M. Hvid to manufacture oil
                    engines and contracted with Hercules to design and manufacture a line of single-,
                    horizontal-cylinder oil engines. Four engines, ranging in size from 1$1/2 to 8
                    horsepower, were designed by Hercules's engineers under the direct supervision of an
                    engineer from Hvid's company and under the <list type="footnotes">

                    chauffeur. William G. Irwin was born in 1866, the son of Joseph I. Irwin. The elder Irwin had come

                    merchandising, and banking. William joined his father in the various family enterprises after his

                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>

                    William H. Donner, the organizer of the company, recalled that "Will Irwin, who was a close
                    friend, agreed to put in $5,000 and Joseph I. Irwin subscribed $20,000, which

                    invested in the firm. In 1899 the company was sold to the American Tin Plate Company, and Donner,
                    the Irwins, and the Sweeneys made a large profit.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> That same year the Irwins

            <p>In the years following these initial nonlocal investments the Irwins continued to diversify and

                    working in the pioneer car industry exciting.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the time Cummins became Irwin's chauffeur the occupation of chauffeur ing was a warm
                    weather occupation. Thus, when Irwin's Packard was up on blocks during the winter, Irwin
                    employed Cummins in other jobs at Irwin's bank, on the inter-urban cars, and at the starch
                    plant. During some winters young Clessie worked in <placeName>

                    </placeName> automobile plants. In 1913 he decided to go into the automobile repair business, and
                    Irwin gave him the use of an abandoned mill building to house his new shop. Two years later Irwin
                    built a new family garage much larger than needed for the family's cars and suggested that
                    Clessie use half of it for his repair shop and maintain the family's cars as the rent
                    payment. Cummins quickly agreed to Irwin's proposal.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1917 Cummins decided to go into the machine shop business, and Irwin financed the purchase of
                    machinery for the new business, which was located in Clessie's half of Irwin's
                    garage. Irwin also became a salesman and wrote letters to machine tool companies soliciting
                    business. In his letters he told prospective customers that Cummins's shop had a screw
                    machine with a wire feed, heavy-duty lathes with eleven-, thirteen-, and sixteen-inch swing, a
                    milling machine, a planer, a hand miller, and drill presses. There is no record that

                    April, 1917, Cummins received a large contract for the machining of artillery-wagon hubs. By
                    September his shop was running full-blast, twenty-four hours a day. When the Irwin, Sweeney, and
                    Miller family members returned from their annual vacation, they found that their family cars had
                    been moved to a public garage to make more room for Cummins's work and that their yard had
                    been stacked with castings. They decided that the shop had to be moved, and it was soon relocated
                    into a part of the former Cerealine mill near Seventh and Jackson streets in <placeName>

            <p>As his military orders dwindled during the summer of 1918, Cummins began to solicit civilian
                    business. Among his new customers was Hercules Gas Engine Company. Being an inquisitive fellow,
                    Cummins asked about the oil engines Hercules engineers were designing and learned that he also might
                    obtain a license to build Hvid-type engines. Consequently, in November he visited the Hvid
                    Engineering Company in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The performance of the engines impressed Cummins, and he learned that he could indeed
                    obtain a license to manufacture them for a fee of twenty-five hundred dollars and a royalty of five
                    dollars per engine produced.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cummins did not have the capital needed to equip an engine plant, but he received a promise of
                    financial backing from Irwin after he discussed the possibilities of the oil engine business with
                    him. He then proceeded with the organization of the Cummins Engine Company. Irwin had backed Cummins
                    in his early, small businesses because of what the latter termed "a parental-like fondness
                    for me."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Irwin, however, had an additional reason for financing
                    Cummins's new engine company: he wanted to improve the depressed economy of <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>On January 30, 1919, Cummins publicly announced his plans to form an engine company at a meeting of
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> Chamber of Commerce. The next day the <hi rend="i">Evening Republican</hi> reflected
                    Cummins's enthusiasm in a lead article with the headline: "COLUMBUS TO BE HOME OF
                    ENGINE BUILT TO BURN ANY KIND OF OIL AND OPERATE REGARDLESS OF COLD." A supplementary
                    headline claimed: "UNLIMITED DEMAND ALREADY ASSURED." The newspaper reported that
                    the new company would occupy all three floors of the old Cerealine mill then occupied by Cummins
                    Machine Works. The new company would benefit <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>

                    purchased from local companies. Additionally, the company was to be entirely locally owned, and
                    indeed some thirty <placeName>

                    </placeName> residents subscribed for the initial offering of fifty thousand dollars of common
                        stock.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Later that same year when the capitalization of the company was increased to one hundred thousand
                    dollars, most of the original shareholders doubled their investment, and some new subscribers bought
                    shares. When all the shares had been paid for, Irwin owned 36 percent of the company's
                    stock. Cummins owned 20 percent of the stock, which he had received in return for the assets of his
                    machine shop. The remainder of the stock was owned by Columbus investors except for a small number
                    of undistributed shares. The original employees of the engine company were the eight men and one
                    woman who had been the work force of Cummins Machine Works. Additional workers were added during
                    1919, including people with needed skills. In May an engineering department was started with the
                    hiring of Cummins's brother-in-law Joseph E. McCoy as draftsman. In midsummer Carl Hertel,
                    a tool maker, was hired to become plant superintendent. Clessie knew who he wanted to run the plant:

            <p>As part of his license agreement Cummins received engine design plans, and by April, 1919, Cummins
                    had built his first engine, a six horsepower model identical to the one designed by Hercules. While
                    experimenting with this first engine, Cummins invented a means of mechanically controlling the
                    timing of ignition in the precombustion chamber. This invention corrected the problem of erratic
                    ignition caused by the wide variation in the quality of the fuels available at that time. Cummins
                    was granted his first diesel engine patent for his invention. He sold this first six horsepower
                    engine in September, and by the end of the company's fiscal year in February, 1920, he had
                    sold a total of twenty-two engines.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While Clessie Cummins was experimenting with his first engine, Sears, Roebuck was making its 1920
                    sales projections. When Sears informed Hercules of its requirements, the latter found that they did
                    not have enough production capacity to build all of the diesel engines and all of the gasoline
                    engines that they and Sears needed. To resolve this dilemma H. L. Knudsen recalled that
                    "Mac [V. E. McMullen] recommended to Mr. Tippett that they find someone else to build the 1
                    1/2 and 3 horsepower Hvid engines, and for the job he recommended C. L. Cummins." As a
                    result of this recommendation "Mr. Tippett and McMullen … [went] to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> and met with Mr. W. G. Irwin and C. L. to discuss the matter and it was quickly
                    arranged that C. L. would build the 1 1/2 and 3 horsepower engines."<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his memoirs Cummins recalled that Tippett was accompanied by his assistant B. F. Watson and an
                    engineer E. B. Blakely. They were favorably impressed with Cummins's new shop and the six
                    horsepower engine on the shop's test stand. Tippett proposed that Cummins build forty-five
                    hundred of the 1 1/2 and 3 horsepower engines. "The proposition nearly took my breath
                    away," Cummins later wrote. "Visions of instant success started swimming in my
                    head." Cummins did, however, question whether the two engine models, which had never been
                    built or <list type="footnotes">

                    was told, "We've sold thousands of the larger engines and we know what
                    we're doing." Reassured by this statement, Cummins discussed the Sears proposal
                    with Irwin, then agreed to accept it and a proposal to sell fuel injectors with his new timing
                    device to Hercules for use on its six and eight horsepower diesel engines. As a result of the latter
                    agreement Cummins sold fourteen thousand dollars of fuel injectors to Hercules during 1919 and
                        1920.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since Sears planned to sell the engines through their sales order catalogue and not offer any
                    service, it was anxious to sell them at as low a price as possible. To meet its price objectives
                    Sears asked Cummins to commit to his vendors for all parts for the entire order, and on this basis
                    he calculated his production costs. After having his calculations checked, at Irwin's
                    request, by Quentin G. Noblitt, he went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

            </p>
            <p>Sears was able to list Cummins's 11/2 and 3 horsepower engines and Hercules's 6 and
                    8 horsepower engines in its spring, 1920, catalogue. The basic models of these engines were equipped
                    to run on kerosene, but an optional arrangement that allowed the engines to run on crude oil was
                    available also. Marketed under the Sears tradename of Thermoil, the engines were sold under terms of
                    cash with the order or "$5.00 with order—Thirty Days
                    Trial—Ten Months to Pay." The prices and specifications published by Sears in

            <p>The Sears catalogue listing brought an influx of orders before Cummins was able to produce the
                    engines. In September, 1920, B. F. Watson complained, "Mr. Cummins is gradually building up
                    an organization, but I don't believe he realizes the importance of the position he is in as
                    he is holding some 400 of our orders, the oldest of which dates back to the 14th of January and yet
                    this condition does not seem to worry him in the least." In his report on
                    Cummins's operation E. B. Blakely suggested that some of the reasons for Cummins's
                    slowness in starting production were: weak management; the purchase of all castings from a small,
                    inefficient, and "thoroughly unionized" company; and the lack of tool and jig
                    equipment resulting from Cummins's attempts to save money by having only two toolmakers to
                    fabricate all his equipment. Eventually, however, Cummins's production levels did begin to
                    improve. In August, 1920, 80 of the 1 1/2 horsepower engines were produced along with 5 of the 3
                    horsepower engines and 305 injectors for the Hercules engines. In December, 1920, 110 of the smaller
                    engines and a nearly equal number of the larger engines were produced.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the size of Cummins's organization at the height of his production for Sears
                    cannot be known because the payroll records for this period are missing from the early ledgers.
                    Hiring procedures were not very sophisticated at Cummins Engine Company in its early days.
                    "All they did was write your name and clock number on a card and that was it," E.
                    Don Tull recalled concerning his own hiring. "I went to work there running a drill press
                    and one day the truant officer came around. He said, ‘That boy isn't old enough
                    to work in a machine shop.’ I was only 14 1/2." Tull was consequently reassigned
                    to the task of recording data on the test block and was not allowed to operate machinery.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In January, 1921, more engines were being returned from Sears than were being shipped by Cummins. One
                    of the reasons for the high number of returned machines was Sears's easy payment plan. Many
                    farmers realized that they could order an engine, use it for thirty days, return it, and have their
                    down payment and freight charges refunded. One Cummins employee <list type="footnotes">

                    run "just like a new one."<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Another reason for the high
                    number of returns was mechanical failure. In some cases the problem was that farmers failed to clean
                    the injectors when they became clogged by an accumulation of carbon. As one Cummins employee
                    recalled, "The farmers expected the engines to run [without maintenance] and they
                        didn't"<hi rend="sup">34</hi> In many other cases, however, the machines were
                    defective. One defect in the machines was their tendency to run out of control at too great a speed
                    and thereby come apart. Carl Hertel recalled seeing an example of this runaway defect while showing
                    a customer how to operate the engine. "We were talking over against a horse stall when the
                    engine ran away and the flywheel cut through the boards."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fact that the machines were defective became apparent after only a few months. Sears, however,
                    decided to continue to try to sell the engines since both Hercules and Cummins had large inventories
                    of components they had purchased in advance at Sears's request. In 1921 Sears discontinued
                    installment sales of the engines and sold them on a cash with order basis only. To make the engines
                    more attractive to potential buyers the prices of the 1 1/2 and 3 horsepower models were cut to
                    $79.50 and $106.50, respectively; the ratings of the 6 and 8 horsepower
                    engines were increased to 7 and 9 horsepower; and the prices of the latter two engines were reduced
                    to $195.50 for the smaller of the two and $259.95 for the larger. Even at the
                    new low prices the engines did not sell in significant numbers. After the first quarter of 1921
                    Cummins Engine Company did not ship any engines to Sears or fuel injectors to Hercules. Sears did
                    continue to list the Thermoil engines in its 1922 and 1923 catalogues, but whatever orders they
                    received they apparently filled with engines already in stock.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Thermoil engine fiasco did not hurt Hercules very much because of the size and diversity of the
                    Hercules enterprises. In fact, in 1920 the Hercules companies had a combined net profit of four
                    hundred forty-eight thousand dollars from the sale of <list type="footnotes">

                    consolidated to form Hercules Corporation, which had a capitalization of eight million dollars. They
                    also issued $1.5 million of notes, repayable with gold, for additional working capital
                    and to expand engine plant capacity to eighty-five thousand engines annually. At the time Hercules
                    occupied thirty-one acres of ground and claimed that it was the largest vehicle factory in the
                    world. The new Hercules Corporation ceased making diesel engines and added furniture and
                    refrigerators to the products it produced. By 1925 Hercules had discontinued its production of
                    buggies and made household refrigerators, marketed under the tradename Serv-el, its principal
                    product. This shift in product emphasis was reflected by Hercules Corporation's decision to
                    change its name to the Servel Manufacturing Company in 1926.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

            <p>Cummins Engine Company did not weather the Thermoil disaster as well as Hercules. The company was
                    especially hard hit because the problems with the Thermoil engines coincided with the
                    company's difficulties with its first marine engine. During the time Cummins Engine Company
                    was making engines for Sears, Clessie developed a single-cylinder marine engine that produced eight
                    horsepower. Cummins personally demonstrated his engine to Gulf Coast fishermen in early 1921 and was
                    able to sell several of them. Soon, however, it became apparent that this engine suffered from the
                    same runaway defect as the Thermoil engines. According to Cummins's autobiography,
                    "The crankshaft counterweights were flying off, cutting engines apart, taking out the sides
                    of boats, and shearing tops off boat cabins."<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Thus, by mid-1921
                    Cummins had nothing to sell except machine shop capacity. For the next three years
                    Cummins's sales were usually less than one hundred dollars per month, and the
                    company's losses were covered by loans from Irwin family funds.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Naturally, the original shareholders became very discouraged during these lean years. Raymond
                    Frohman, the Cummins Engine Company's bookkeeper, noted that when any of them brought their
                    shares into Irwin's bank, they were paid the full one hundred dollars per share

                    held onto their stock while the rest sold their shares to Irwin. As a result the Irwin family came
                    to control 75 percent of the common stock of Cummins Engine Company. After the deaths of Irwin and
                    his sister Linnie Sweeney the Irwin family stock was inherited by Sweeney's grandchildren

            <p>Fortunately for the future of the diesel industry in Indiana, Clessie Cummins had not run out of
                    ideas and W. G. Irwin had not run out of money. In late 1921 Cummins came up with an idea for an
                    improved fuel injector. "He tried to explain the idea to me with the result that when he
                    said that it would cost $10,000 to prove the idea, I told him that I would furnish the
                    money," W. G. Irwin wrote many years later. "The idea turned out to be an
                    improvement but it was not enough; so he got another idea and another $10,000 and these
                    ideas and 10,000s continued for quite a period until he made a discovery for which he received basic
                    patent protection."<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before putting up the first ten thousand dollars, however, Irwin had Cummins invite H. L. Knudsen to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> to give an opinion on the feasibility of the new concept. When Knudsen told Irwin and
                    Cummins that the idea would work but would require a lot of research to make it operate
                    satisfactorily, they asked Knudsen to join the company as chief engineer and to develop the idea.
                    Knudsen agreed and began his career at Cummins Engine Company in January, 1922.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All of 1922 and 1923 were spent by Cummins and Knudsen developing and testing injectors. After about
                    a year of experimenting they abandoned the precombustion chamber concept because they could not
                    prevent carbon formation in the cup. The alternative they developed was a unique arrangement that
                    injected the fuel directly into the combustion chamber; thus, doing away with the precombustion
                    chamber. An engine with the new injector was placed on the market in 1924. Designated Model F, the
                    new engine proved to be an excellent engine for marine propulsion and electric power generation. It
                    also proved to be very durable: some being kept in use for more than forty years.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

            <p>For about the first two years of production things went very well. In 1925 J. Kuttner, editor and
                    publisher of <hi rend="i">Oil Engine Power</hi> and <hi rend="i">Motorship,</hi> visited
                    Cummins's plant. Kuttner had just spent three years in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> doing consulting work and was, according to Cummins, "a hard-boiled German
                    engineer." When this "hard-boiled" expert saw the Model F, however,
                    "He was," Cummins wrote to Irwin, "dumbfounded when he saw the
                    performance our engine put up…. He told us that he was willing to go on record that we
                    had the finest development and the most advanced engine that he has seen or heard of."<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cummins got into another fiasco, however, when he sold sixty of these engines to the Northwest
                    Engineering Company of Green Bay, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, during the years 1925 to 1927. Northwest used the engines in its shovels and
                    draglines; the first ever application of diesel engines to earth moving machinery.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Like all diesels of the era the Model F had all of its valve and injector actuating
                    mechanisms on the outside of the engine, and these components quickly became clogged with the dust
                    and dirt common in a shovel's work environment. Also, the fuel system had a characteristic
                    that delivered proportionately larger quantities of fuel when the engine was lugged down in speed.
                    Whenever the operator dug into a bank of earth and slowed the engine, it belched black smoke and
                    pulled harder and harder the more it was lugged down; in some cases it pulled until the shovel was
                    tipped over!<hi rend="sup">46</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Northwest discontinued the diesel experiment in 1927. Their action was perhaps premature because by
                    the next year Cummins had developed the first diesel engines in the world that had all their moving
                    parts enclosed and pressure-lubricated. And by 1929 Cummins Engine Company had developed a unique
                    distributor type fuel pump that accurately controlled fuel delivery in variable-speed
                        applications.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cummins gained another benefit from the shovel fiasco besides a better designed engine: the increased

                    Reeves and Company. The company offices were moved into a frame building across Fifth Street, which
                    employees always referred to as "the old house." The latter structure still stands

            </p>
            <p>By 1929 Cummins's principal business had become the sale of engines for yachts being built
                    for financiers and speculators who were riding high on the stock market boom. When the market
                    crashed in October, Cummins's yacht engine sales crashed with it. W. G. Irwin told Cummins
                    that he saw hard times ahead and would have to close the engine plant. Cummins knew that he had to
                    come up with something dramatic to keep Irwin's interest alive, and so he installed one of
                    his engines in a 1925 Packard limousine; thus, creating the first diesel automobile. He gave Irwin a
                    surprise demonstration on Christmas Day, 1929, that restored Irwin's enthusiasm and ended
                    all thought of closing the company.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Packard limousine experiment was followed by the installation of diesel engines in a Packard
                    roadster and a Duesenberg race car. The Packard set and the Duesenberg broke the first diesel
                    vehicle speed records at Daytona Beach, and in 1931 the Duesenberg became the first car ever to
                    finish the <placeName>

                    interest among both the general public and industrial companies. Several of the latter made offers
                    to buy Cummins Engine Company or to enter into a royalty arrangement to manufacture the engines the
                    company had developed. Although Irwin later said that he had had no intention of selling the engine
                    company once the possibility of its becoming a successful venture became obvious, he did allow
                    negotiations for the sale of the company to proceed almost to the signing state. However, after E.
                    R. Erskine, the president of Studebaker, told him that he lacked the experience to exploit the new
                    development, Irwin grew stubborn and told John Niven, the general manager of Cummins, that there
                    would be no sharing of the product in America and that the time had come "to go ahead in

            <p>More important than the publicity created by the cars was the fact that the cars' engines
                    could run at twenty-two hundred r.p.m., more than twice as fast as any other diesel engine.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> With engines like these Cummins and Irwin concluded that the company had the
                    technology needed to design a "truck and bus" diesel. After a survey was made of
                    the market and physical requirements for such engines, H. L. Knudsen designed a six-cylinder, 125
                    horsepower engine that ran at a governed speed of eighteen hundred r.p.m. The engine, which later
                    was designated Model H, went onto the test stand in late November, 1931, and after a few hours of
                    break-in it was installed in a test truck. During December the truck and its engine were endurance
                    tested by being run 14,600 miles nonstop at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Speedway, a new vehicle record.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this endurance test Cummins was ready to begin selling the engines, but W. G. Irwin insisted on
                    more testing in different climates and by men who knew nothing about a diesel.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
                    Therefore, the first diesel truck went into commercial service during May, 1932, in the fleet of
                    Purity Stores, a <placeName>

                    </placeName> food-store chain in which the Irwin family had a large financial interest. This truck
                    was used as a demonstrator in addition to its normal work of delivering groceries throughout
                    northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. After observing the truck's performance for several months, both Savage

                    </placeName> and Valley Freight Lines of Fresno bought four diesel trucks. Since Cummins had no
                    dealers to service the engines, Don Cummins was sent from the factory to take care of them. These
                    two trucking companies gave the new diesel trucks a most severe test by having them pull sixty-eight
                    thousand pound truck full trailer combinations over the long, difficult routes from San <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName>. When the diesels ran three times longer before requiring overhauling than the best
                    gasoline engines, "word spread up and down the Coast just like wildfire," one
                    observer recalled, and other truck fleets began to order diesel trucks.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Almost immediately, cries for more power were heard from the truckers who hauled heavy loads through
                    mountains, and Cummins began what would become a continuous program of modifications and application
                    of new technology to the engine. In 1936 the original engine was modified to produce 150 horsepower,
                    and the next year a supercharged version of 200 horsepower was developed, which became the standard
                    power for the largest mining trucks of that era.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although Cummins had produced a better mousetrap, the company did not wait for the world to beat a
                    path to its door. Instead, people were hired to make things happen. In 1934 J. Irwin Miller, W. G.
                    Irwin's grandnephew, joined the company and directed it for the next forty years, mostly as
                    chairman and chief executive officer. The same year Paris E. Letsinger became vice-president of
                    sales and established a unique sales and service organization and new policies that have since
                    become the standard of the industry. In 1935 V. E. McMullen was hired as a consultant. He changed
                    what was little more than a job shop with secondhand equipment into an efficient, volume production
                    facility. And H. L. Knudsen continued to direct the development of new and improved engines for
                    another decade as vice-president of engineering.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The new engine was very versatile. In addition to its use in the trucking and mining industries, it
                    also was widely applied to oil well drilling rigs, industrial locomotives, construction machinery,
                    and other equipment that had used steam or gasoline engines until then. As a result engine sales
                    rose from 133 in <list type="footnotes">

                    believed that honest men in this world have a duty to speak out and a work of leadership to perform.
                    In time, however, his loathing for a university president he thought a "rascal"

                    snake-in-the-grass and a hypocrite of the rankest kind." After accepting his position
                    Dabney found that the trustees had reduced the salary which <placeName>

                    the university. Dabney brought modern historical study to the university and was eager to discuss

                    much discussion.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dabney's major accomplishment at Indiana University was the development of the history
                    curriculum. His predecessor, John G. Newkirk, had taught several one-term courses, starting with
                    French and English history for sophomores. At the time of his appointment <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> encouraged Dabney "to experiment some, and manage your <hi rend="u">final</hi>
                    courses after you have tried a year."<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Dabney's response was
                    to rearrange Newkirk's offerings into an orderly list of seven European history courses by
                    dropping some existing courses and adding others. He began his curriculum with two terms in European
                    intellectual history for sophomores and a new course in the French Revolution, his particular
                    interest at this early time in his career. By 1888 he had developed a logical program of courses on
                    the pattern of German universities and the Johns Hopkins University in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>, institutions in the forefront of modern, scientific historical study. For sophomores
                    he taught "General History of European Civilization," an introductory course
                    divided between two terms in intellectual history and one in the history of rationalism. For juniors
                    he arranged a three-term sequence on the "History of Special Nations"
                            (<placeName>
                  <country reg="gr">Greece</country>, <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>,
                            <country reg="enk">England</country>
               </placeName>) and for seniors a sequence entitled
                    "History of Special Periods" (Decline and Fall of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Reformation, French Revolution).<hi rend="sup">28</hi> He also catalogued several
                    American history courses, but James A. Woodburn, who was to teach them, was on leave to do doctoral
                    study at Johns Hopkins. Dabney, in fact, taught the various courses on the history schedule alone
                    most of the time he was at the university. When Andrew White, president of Cornell, visited <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he said that the history curriculum was "the best arranged of any in this
                    country." A local newspaper commented that White's remarks were "a very
                    high compliment to Dr. Dabney to whose efforts it is due."<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
                    Dabney's appointment to the faculty, therefore, marked the real beginning of "an
                    organized, separate program of history in the university."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>Dabney also gained a reputation beyond the classroom. On Field Day in 1888 there was a baseball game
                    between faculty and students in which Dabney played third base. The student newspaper teased
                    beforehand that a base-stealing senior might "hurl him into all the vortexes of the French
                    Revolution." Nonetheless, the faculty won, and people talked about the game and its
                    atheltic hero: "Did you see Dr. Dabney make that home run?"<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He settled less easily into the town of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, a town "which," he wrote to his aunt, "I like as well as I
                    expected, but which is by no means the garden spot of the world." He did find agreeable
                    accommodation at Emma Dennis's rooming house on South College Avenue. His landlady was
                    "an exceedingly plumpsome and amiable old person [who] has relatives in the
                    South," and his fellow boarders were congenial members of the faculty. He remained at
                    Dennis's rooming house for the entire three years he was at the university because the
                    situation was as pleasant as one could find "in such a place as <placeName>

                    "sympathize" with their going "beyond the pale of civilization to live in
                    a cold bleak climate among brutal savages."<hi rend="sup">35</hi> His letters contain
                    frequent aspersions on life in Hoosierdom, and even after nearly three years he lamented

            <p>After only a few months in Indiana, Dabney encountered unexpected and unwanted controversy. President

                    charged that he had been a guard at the notorious Andersonville prison and had
                    "‘probably’ amused himself by shooting at prisoners whose claims for
                    pensions he had now been called to examine." The doctor had been born in <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> Heath Dabney found himself in the midst of the uproar over his uncle's
                    appointment. When the town's sympathetic Democratic editor interviewed him, he said that
                    the charges were all monstrous lies. And he reiterated his uncle's statements about not
                    serving in the Confederate army and securing the pension position through an honest civil service
                        examination.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> This bloody-shirt incident increased the discomfort Heath
                    Dabney felt living among "the Hoosiers" and foreshadowed newspaper assaults on him
                    two years later.</p>

                    </placeName> and the state, he naturally thought about seeking a new position. He was not consoled
                    by a friend's assurance that "the administration of your institution …
                    is no worse than that of most other state universities." He agreed more readily with his
                    friend's judgment that "there is no end to rascality" and that university
                    presidents were "men whose forte is evasion, trickery and dissimulation, by some called
                        tact."<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Dabney's engagement to Mary Amanda Bentley of

               </placeName>, during the 1886 Christmas recess restricted his search for a
                    new position because he wanted to have an adequate salary before marrying since neither he nor his
                    finance possessed other income. In early 1887 Wilson suggested that there might be a position at
                    Bryn Mawr College, but this post at "Johanna Hopkins" had less potential and
                    salary than Dabney already had at Indiana. Dabney concluded he should "stick to what I have
                        got."<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Later in 1887 Dabney heard a rumor about a more attractive position: Professor George Frederick

                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. He had reason to believe that Holmes, "a friend," wanted him to be
                    his successor. He wrote excitedly to Wilson to keep "mum" about his aspirations
                    until <placeName>

                    Dabney lamented, "So I suppose I must remain a Hoosier for at least another
                        year."<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What made the prospect of a third year at Indiana University tolerable to Dabney was his marriage.
                    After his engagement to Mary Bentley he felt compelled to defer the wedding for "an
                    indefinite period" because of his salary.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> He perhaps said little
                    about his engagement on campus, but in spring, 1887, there was "a rumor that Prof. Dabney
                    will return with a handsome bride next September."<hi rend="sup">45</hi> He did spend a

                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> during that summer, but his marriage did not take place until June 14, 1888, by which
                    time his salary had increased to the fifteen hundred dollars he considered necessary.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> After visiting Dabney's father in <placeName>

                    </placeName> early in September to hearty congratulations from university friends. A local account
                    described Mrs. Dabney as "a very pleasant lady" who would be "very
                    popular among her new acquaintances."<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Dabney continued to live at
                    Dennis's rooming house, where he rented more space to accommodate his new bride. He wrote
                    to his favorite aunt, Susan Dabney Smedes, that "Mary and I have fitted up a little bower
                    where we are happy in spite of Hoosiers and Hoosierdom." He went on to describe the sitting
                    room, which contained two chairs purchased with Aunt Sue's ten-dollar wedding
                    gift—"and very pretty ones they are," he assured her.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heath Dabney's marriage and professional prospects seemed auspicious for his third year at
                    Indiana, but ahead lay conflict, for he felt compelled to speak out on Yankee misconduct during the
                    1888 election. Dabney was a liberally trained academic who absorbed many of the mugwump reform
                    impulses of the Gilded Age, but only within the limitations set by his southern background. Dabney
                    was born in 1860, and he believed the tragedy of his life had been the Civil War. Writing to his
                    aunt he said that "it seems as though it were impossible for our family to recover from the
                    terrible calamities brought on us by the war."<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

                    <pb n="349" id="VAA4025-082-4-053"/> The war had bankrupted Thomas Dabney's friend and thus
                    led to the foreclosure on Burleigh in 1866 and the family's subsequent
                    "calamities." Heath Dabney was therefore sensitive to "war
                    issues." He believed that political parties had to dissolve to bring about sectional
                    reconciliation. Republicans, he wrote, "must lay down their arms" and
                    "cease to wave the bloody shirt," but in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> he saw no indication that this would happen. As long as Yankees considered southerners
                    to be traitors, he believed the South must remain solid, regardless of what became of civil service
                    reform, the labor question, or the silver question. His interest in reform filtered through his
                    obsession with "war issues."<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The family's view of Reconstruction had a Bourbon cast that young Heath accepted. Susan
                    Dabney Smedes wrote in her remarkable book about her father Thomas, <hi rend="i">Memorials of a
                        Southern Planter</hi> (1887), that in the mid-1870s <placeName>

                    and the misguided African element." She described "financial bankruptcy and social
                        degradation."<hi rend="sup">51</hi> Corruption years earlier had produced a higher
                    state debt than Reconstruction, but that mattered little to planters seeking to reestablish
                    privileged positions. Heath Dabney was delighted with Aunt Sue's book, which received good
                    reviews and went through several American and English editions. "Hurrah, hooray for Aunt
                    ‘Snicks’!!! She sut'ny do take de cake," he cheered.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> With his sense that recent history had caused his family "terrible

            <p>At Thanksgiving dinner given in 1887 by a fellow faculty member, he found himself talking loosely to

                    </placeName>, Dabney committed in November, 1888, the deed which made him notorious in Indiana. He
                    decided to write to <hi rend="i">The Nation,</hi> a genteel national magazine that supported mugwump
                    reforms, "in the interest of political science and of good government" and

                    Dabney thought, with reason, that there had been corruption.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> Shortly after he
                    had arrived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1886, Dabney had heard allegations that "boodle" amounting to some
                    five thousand dollars had been spent by the two parties to buy votes in the fall election in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>

                    </placeName>. After the elections Dabney wrote to Wilson about the corruption and commented that it
                    seemed "the noble Hoosier has an inalienable right to sell his vote."<hi rend="sup">56</hi> Because Dabney thought hushing up such abuses would not lead to reform, he
                    decided in 1888 that it was "high time that honest men should speak out."<hi rend="sup">57</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The story, as he related it to <hi rend="i">The Nation,</hi> was a saturnalia of corrupt practice. He
                    calculated that there were thirty thousand "floaters" in Indiana who sold their
                    votes to the highest bidder and there were two hundred of them in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> out of a voting population of seven hundred. "The magnitude of the evil is
                    apparent," he said. It was his observation that a controversial recommendation by
                    Republican national treasurer William Dudley of Indiana regarding blocks of five (i.e., one trusted
                    Republican escorting five floaters to the polls and paying them off) was "almost literally
                    an order to the Republican ‘workers.’ " He recounted methods by which
                    Republicans organized and paid floaters, including holding some overnight at the office of
                    "the leading Republican paper of the county," namely the <placeName>

                    couldn't buy them. Better stick to your books, Professor, and let politics
                        alone."<hi rend="sup">59</hi> Dabney did not take this first editorial reaction
                    seriously: "I … can afford to ignore the snarling of these journalistic
                    curs….I shall not ask the advice of the Journal."<hi rend="sup">60</hi> A

            <p>Dabney's own letter to Bradfute was a bit more choleric. It was, he said, "a matter

                    during the election. And a southern newspaper called articles in Indiana's Republican press

                    went until anxiety over Dabney's letter had spent itself. While Dabney's critics
                    never addressed his specific allegations, the state legislature did pass an election reform law in
                    1889, due in part to the national publicity Dabney had given to corrupt election practices during
                    the infamous 1888 election.<hi rend="sup">72</hi>

            <p>Indiana heard yet more from "that man Dabney" after the election. On January 8,
                    1889, at the Jackson Day dinner in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Dabney gave a talk titled "Corruption in Politics."<hi rend="sup">73</hi> Walter Bradfute sneered that Dabney addressed only Democrats because "the man who

                    Furthermore, Dabney and other faculty members (including President Jordan) signed a petition in
                    January calling for a tariff reform convention to meet in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    certainly the best known of the speakers. His subject was universal suffrage and the civil

                    pessimistic since the election. He introduced his topic by saying "the grim logic"
                    of the Civil War proved the Constitution was not a panacea and the Founding Fathers were fallible.
                    Faith in free government was not sufficient to cope with "the grave moral evils of the
                    time," among them the condition of the civil service as effected by universal suffrage. He
                    attacked rotation in office (the "spoils system") as mistakenly derived from the
                    idea that one man's political opinion was as good as another's, and thus rotation

                    a remedy because there was no such thing as equal justice: "Men are born <hi rend="u">neither</hi> free <hi rend="u">nor</hi> equal." Freedom resulted from individual
                    exertion and the gift of society and state. Civilization was based on inequality and
                    differentiation, and "to force … equality is an attempt … to destroy
                    civilization." Thus there was no natural right to vote or to hold civil service office:
                    "the alleged government of the people, by the people, and for the people bids fair to
                    become a government of the floaters, by the wire-pullers, and for the plutocrats." He
                    concluded that there must be "some sort of class government," and that men fitted
                    in character and training for public duties should be that governing class. This governing class
                    would be an aristocracy of the best, most honest, capable, industrious, and patriotic men in the
                    country—in short, men such as himself. He urged state election reform and the extension
                    of nonpartisan civil service examinations to more federal offices to help improve the quality of
                    government and the bureaucrats who served in it.<hi rend="sup">77</hi>

            </byline>
            <p>Over the past decade historians have exhibited considerable interest in early nineteenth-century
                    attempts to reform criminal justice. Most of this research has detailed the post-Revolutionary shift
                    from retributive to reformative justice and the corresponding development of the penitentiary,
                    especially in eastern states. The prison, a symbol of reform experiments, had a dual purpose: to
                    rehabilitate inmates and, by virtue of its success, to serve as a model of order for a disorderly
                    society. But, as historian David J. Rothman has noted, the dreams of reformers contained the seeds
                    of later nightmares. Faulty theories of crime and society and a naive reliance on the curative
                    effect of the prison's internal structure plagued efforts at reform. Overwhelmed by the
                    number of inmates, the penitentiary by the Civil War had taken on a custodial role.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Scholarly focus on the penitentiary has obscured the extent to which reform efforts addressed all
                    parts of the criminal justice system. Equally important were attempts to limit or abandon the use of
                    corporal punishment, to abolish the death penalty, and to rewrite the criminal code to make it more
                    comprehensive and a better deterrent to crime. In many states, including Indiana, each of these
                    proposals stimulated wide-ranging public debate and significant reform of criminal law.</p>

            <p>But the course of reform was not smooth, nor were reform goals ever fully realized. As
                    Indiana's experience demonstrates, there were limits to the reform impulse beyond those
                    mentioned by Rothman and other historians of the penitentiary movement. A limited treasury, residual
                    beliefs in retribution, and continuing use of criminal law to reinforce traditional moral order also
                    slowed and diverted reform efforts. These circumstances not only affected the development of the
                    penitentiary but also stymied efforts to eliminate capital punishment and to make statutory criminal
                    law more rational and humane.</p>
            <p>This essay traces the course of criminal justice reform in Indiana from 1816 to 1860, focusing
                    primarily on statutory law, judicial opinion, and public debates as key indices to reform efforts.
                    Although sometimes described as a "reform movement," it would be misleading to
                    conclude that advocates of reform united under a single banner. Indeed, it is difficult to identify
                    even a loose coterie of leaders or agreement among reformers upon a common agenda. Ideas to recast
                    the criminal justice system were widespread in Indiana and attracted strong support from many
                    obscure legislators and citizens representing all parts of the state. Participation in reform
                    efforts, moreover, came from all demographic and political groups. While later research may discover
                    some significant patterns of support, this essay will confine its focus to the context and
                    manifestations of criminal justice reform in antebellum Indiana.</p>
            <p>By the mideighteenth century, reformation had replaced retribution as the goal of an enlightened
                    criminal law. This change in the theory of punishment owed much to the Italian scholar, Cesare
                    Beccaria. His treatise <hi rend="i">On Crime and Punishment</hi> became the standard for many of the
                    post-Revolutionary reforms of punition. In this "manifesto of the liberal approach to
                    criminal law," Beccaria expressed an ardent faith in the power of human reason and the
                    perfectability of social institutions.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> He repeatedly urged that law should not
                    restrict human freedom unnecessarily. To do otherwise increased crime by creating more opportunities
                    for men to violate legal prohibitions. Beccaria offered other prescriptions for a fair and humane
                    criminal process. Criminal law should be fixed in a written code, with presumption of innocence
                    maintained at every stage of the prosecution. Severe punishment was to be avoided because it made
                    criminals "commit additional crimes to avoid punishment for a single one."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> To be <list type="footnotes">

                    the crime, and inflicted with speed and certainty.</p>
            <p>For many Americans Beccaria offered a satisfactory solution to the problem of crime and criminal
                    justice. Experience had taught them that severe codes did little to diminish deviant behavior. To
                    the contrary, a correlation appeared to exist between barbarous punishments and increases in
                    criminal activity. The Revolutionary generation took this lesson to heart and set out to rectify the
                    mistakes of colonial codes. By replacing inhumane features of the legal system with rational laws
                    and salutary punishments, reformers believed that crime could be controlled more effectively, if not
                    actually decreased. This conviction, in turn, led to vigorous efforts in the early republic to limit
                    or abolish the death penalty and to develop institutions which reformed offenders.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Throughout the antebellum years Hoosiers publicly and privately declared that reformative principles
                    must guide the criminal process. The state's first Constitution enjoined "cruel
                    and unusual punishments" and required that all penalties "be proportioned to the
                    nature of the offense."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Over thirty years later delegates to a second
                    constitutional convention overwhelmingly endorsed, and voters ratified, a section which declared
                    that the penal code would be "founded on the principles of reformation, and not vindictive
                        justice."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The legislature decided the next year that juvenile
                    offenders in particular must "be treated with humanity and in a manner calculated to
                    promote their reformation."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A number of private citizens also expressed support for a legal system which acted to redeem
                    malefactors. It was in society's best interest, wrote a prominent resident of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName>, to show a "spirit of forgiveness." When the community based laws on
                    arbitrary and sanguinary principles, "then the same feeling of murder and revenge would
                    rule in the breast of its lowest members."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> This sentiment found voice
                    in numerous essays and petitions, especially during the campaign to abolish the death penalty.

            </p>
            <p>Yet the law of criminal punishment in antebellum Indiana reflected this reformist impulse only in
                    part. The state entered the Union with a repressive code which mandated severe penalties for most
                    offenses. A good example of this was the first law code in the territory, the Marietta Statutes of
                    1788. That body of law defined nine crimes, three of which—treason, murder, and
                    arson—were capital offenses. Robbery and burglary carried penalties of fines, whippings,
                    and imprisonment for up to thirty years. Individuals convicted of perjury or theft could be given
                    thirtynine lashes, pilloried, and disfranchised.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Later territorial statutes
                    continued to mandate harsh punishments, although one change allowed courts to jail offenders rather
                    than administer whippings.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Admission to statehood had little immediate impact on criminal law despite the state
                    Constitution's ban on cruel punishments and its requirement for proportionate sentencing.
                    The first state criminal code made no pretense of reforming the offender. Punishment was intended to
                    inflict pain. The code listed fifty-nine crimes and mandated death for four of
                    them—treason, murder, rape, and carnal knowledge of a female under ten years of age.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Many crimes were punishable by whipping. Fifteen of the fifty-nine offenses,
                    or 25 percent, could receive this penalty in addition to fines and imprisonment<hi rend="sup">13</hi> It is difficult to distinguish offenses for which whipping was allowed from those for which
                    it was forbidden. For example, conviction for forgery of <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Although whipping criminals had fallen into disfavor in the more settled East, its use in pioneer
                    Indiana at least ensured that offenders would be punished. After all, the administration of justice
                    in frontier areas was a tenuous thing. It was difficult to catch and convict lawbreakers, and there
                    was no guarantee that once convicted they could be held in insecure county jails. Even so, local
                    courts and juries hesitated to exact the whipping allowed by law. County officials often avoided the
                    punishment by adopting the colonial practice of "warning out," or forcing
                    offenders to move on. On at least one occasion, for instance, residents of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName> allowed defendants to escape rather than whip them.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Whippings
                    were carried out on occasion, but they were usually accompanied by a public outcry so strong that
                    legislators were ultimately persuaded to abandon the practice. A case in point was the demand of a <placeName>

            <p>Reform of the methods of punishment did not end with the decision to outlaw whipping. Throughout the

                    rehabilitate the criminal and allow his return to society. Two types of prison

                    systems thought that the criminal was "the victim of an upbringing that had failed to
                    provide protection against the vices at loose in society" and that a well-regulated
                    institution would counterbalance societal shortcomings.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> They differed only on

                    night. Within a short time, however, an increase in the number of prisoners beyond the number of
                    cells forced abandonment of plans for a nocturnal separation. By 1835, for example, fifty-five
                    inmates crowded into cells designed to hold less than half that <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> plan arose early in 1824 when the General Assembly abolished the Board of Managers
                    appointed to supervise the prison. Legislators then authorized the governor either to appoint a
                    state superintendent to run the facility or to let a three-year contract for oversight of the
                    convicts in return for the use of their labor.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> The choice of the second

            <p>The decision to authorize private management of the state prison suggests that fiscal restraints
                    could override the goal of reformation. A House committee on the state prison confirmed this in 1829
                    when it reported that "the farming out of the prisoners is salutary and calculated to
                    relieve the state of the burthen of annual draughts from the Treasury."<hi rend="sup">24</hi> Still, some lawmakers worried about the value of a prison managed more for profit than
                    rehabilitation. The same legislative report reflected this concern when it concluded that the state
                    should more precisely regulate the governance of prisoners. This feeling grew despite assurances
                    from Governor Noah Noble and other state officers that the privately operated facility well
                    comported "with the spirit of our laws."<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the early 1840s the contract system of prison management was coming increasingly under attack. The
                    state visitor warned that the existing system was fatal to the goal of redemption. It would profit
                    society more, he asserted, to free criminals than to allow them to work outside the walls where they
                    were "cut off… from <hi rend="i">all</hi> moral and religious

                            prison was meeting its goal. In his annual evaluation he noted that "solitary

                    itself, and the entire policy of its discipline … cannot be too soon abandoned for the
                    character of the State."<hi rend="sup">27</hi> But the governor's message revealed
                    little concern for either the alleged mistreatment of prisoners or the failure of the system to
                    reform criminals. He advocated change because he believed that "The Prison itself, is
                    entirely too small…. [It is] impossible to employ the convicts in the limits of the
                    Prison, with advantage to the Superintendents, or the State." Even after acknowledging
                    reports of overcrowding, inhumane treatment of prisoners, and lack of proper supervision, Bigger
                    only recommended that a new and larger building be built, not that the state seek a termination of
                    the contract system.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Evidently, the patronage and tax savings that flowed from
                    private control were not easy to relinquish. A pledge that convict labor would be used to construct

                    governor, Joseph A. Wright, that farming out prisoners was "radically wrong" and
                    "highly objectionable."<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Wright wanted the prison to be a
                    true penitentiary with the reform and reintroduction of the criminal into society its constant goal.
                    To this end he proposed that any profits from convict labor be divided among the inmates and their
                    families instead of reverting to either the state or a private contractor.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> The
                    failure of this suggestion to receive legislative consideration illustrates the fact that even
                    direct state control did not assure meaningful reform. Guards and other prison officials might be on
                    the state payroll, but the contracting of prison labor had to be continued because legislators
                    failed to provide adequate funds for the prison's operation.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

                    An act of 1840 had given juries discretion to sentence a juvenile felon to the county jail instead

            <p>The problem had not been invented by hysterical reformers or crusading politicians. In 1851 the

                    youngest was only eleven years old; another was fourteen.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> The report made an
                    impression on the delegates. When the new Constitution was presented for ratification, it contained

                    debate produced only an ineffectual requirement that juveniles housed in county jails "be

            </p>
            <p>The deadlock continued throughout the 1850s despite the strong support of Indiana governors for
                    separate juvenile facilities. Joseph A. Wright, Democratic governor from 1849 to 1857, was
                    especially concerned by the large numbers of youths in the state prison. In 1855 he reported to an
                    unresponsive legislature that more than one-half of all inmates were under twenty-five years of age
                    and that 36 of 267 inmates were under twenty.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> A warning by the editor of an
                    influential state paper that legislative disregard of the constitutional mandate would result in
                    "making and hardening criminals by state action" was also futile.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Failure to establish separate facilities did not escape the notice of local courts. A
                    newspaper report in 1860 indicated that judges were releasing large numbers of youthful offenders
                    rather than sending them to the state prison.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> Still, the General Assembly did
                    not provide construction funds for a new prison until 1867, even though it had authorized the
                    purchase of land twelve years earlier. The reform impulse so evident in the constitutional
                    convention was unable to overcome the fiscal conservatism of Indiana legislators.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While a limited treasury blunted efforts to bring Indiana's prison organization within
                    patterns advanced elsewhere, a fear of disorder and a residual belief in retribution also kept the
                    state from fully satisfying the constitutional goal of reformation in its penal policies. These
                    other limits to reform are best illustrated by the unsuccessful effort to abolish the death penalty
                    and by the revisions of statute law that incorporated new crimes and mandated stiffer punishments.</p>
            <p>Since the Revolution, men had argued that executions violated the dictates of natural justice. An
                    early Indiana governor, James B. Ray, echoed this sentiment in 1830 when he denounced capital
                    punishment as a "primitive practice." Like Beccaria sixty years earlier Ray
                    objected to the punishment because it made a burlesque of society's proclaimed goal of
                    reforming the <list type="footnotes">

                    estimated at five thousand had gathered much earlier in the day. At the appointed time the prisoners

                    attending the event transformed the "unfortunate convict [into] a brave, generous and
                    daring hero." This defeated the law's purpose of deterring others by example; and

                        description of what that entailed makes death seem attractive by comparison: "The low,

                        Slaughter's predecessors had also advocated that solitary confinement replace the death
                        penalty. See speech of Samuel Merrill to the <placeName>

            <p>Throughout the nation the mid-1840s marked the zenith of the antebellum movement to abolish capital
                        punishment.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> In Indiana major legislative debates occurred in 1843 and
                    1846, with arguments pro and con paralleling positions advanced elsewhere. Opponents of execution
                    thought the practice was barbarous and contrary to principles of reformative justice. For others,
                    true justice demanded retribution measured by the standard of "an eye for an eye."
                    Fears that the penalty might be imposed on innocent persons met the rebuttal that failure to exact
                    death where evidence of guilt was strong would invite mob action and scorn for the law.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> The debates changed few minds. Like the rest of the nation Indiana had
                    drastically reduced the number of capital crimes and had softened penal laws even more by giving
                    courts and juries discretion to impose life imprisonment rather than death.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>
                    This action may have induced self-satisfaction, as it did in other states, and hence made further
                    reform more difficult.<hi rend="sup">58</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was noticeable slippage in reform sentiment after the 1840s. A proposal at the constitutional
                    convention in 1851 to abolish the death penalty except for willful and deliberate murder suffered
                    defeat by a large margin.<hi rend="sup">59</hi> During the session of the General Assembly following
                    the convention, legislators passed a bill decreeing private executions, but a majority of the
                    lawmakers left no doubt that they favored capital punishment.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> A substantial
                    number of representatives even wanted to extend the penalty to additional crimes. Nowhere was this
                    better illustrated than in the defeat, by a margin of thirty-four to forty-four, of a bill to
                    execute any man convicted of seducing an unmarried female of good reputation.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The failure of reformers to capitalize on earlier efforts to change the prison structure or to
                    abolish capital punishment testifies to the legislature's reluctance to go further in
                    satisfying the constitutional goal of reformation in its penal policies. At a minimum, the refusal
                    to abolish capital punishment implies that the state conceded the impossibility of reforming all
                    offenders. Here Indiana was no different than most antebellum states. <list type="footnotes">

                    was necessary to protect society from particularly depraved individuals, even if the penalty
                    embodied a major principle of retributive justice.</p>
            <p>The limits of antebellum reform can also be seen in the several revisions of the criminal law,
                    revisions which sharply increased the number of possible offenses and the severity of punishment.
                    The state's first code defined fifty-nine crimes; by 1852 this number had doubled to 120.
                    Misdemeanors represented the largest part of this increase, rising from twenty-five in 1816 to
                    almost eighty by the Civil War. Felonies grew at a somewhat lesser pace.<hi rend="sup">62</hi> The
                    creation of new crimes was significant. It signaled a departure from an earlier belief that the goal
                    of freedom justified few restrictions on human conduct. This retreat bothered at least one Indiana
                    jurist who, in 1858, cautioned legislators: "Where there is no law, there is not
                    transgression. Where there are many laws, there is much. Hence, criminal laws should not be
                    unnecessarily multiplied."<hi rend="sup">63</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not surprisingly, most of the expansion of the criminal code occurred in the two decades preceding
                    the Civil War. By the late 1830s much of Indiana was no longer a frontier state. It was experiencing
                    a rapid economic growth and widespread demographic change marked by incipient urbanization and an
                    influx of new immigrant groups, especially Germans and Irish. Social unrest, including small-scale
                    riots, accompanied these developments.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> It is small wonder that lawmakers with
                    roots in an earlier, more simple Indiana saw in the criminal law a way to protect a traditional
                    economic and social order.</p>
            <p>In large measure the addition of new crimes and stiffer punishments represented an attempt to keep
                    pace with an infinitely more complex economy. Nowhere was this tendency more pronounced than in the
                    multiplication of crimes against property. These statutes were obviously a response to a commercial
                    development that made new and different demands on the law as the forms of property and the means to
                    endanger them became more numerous. In the first codes, for example, counterfeiting was defined
                    simply and punished lightly. By the 1850s the law detailed <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The increased emphasis on economic crime in late antebellum Indiana corresponded to legal
                    developments in other states. Criminal law was moving from its late eighteenth-century concern with
                    moral order to an emphasis in the Jacksonian Era on the protection of private property.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> This is not to say that punishment of immorality became unimportant.
                    Indiana's experience suggests that an opposite conclusion is more nearly correct. The
                    number of moral-order crimes advanced steadily throughout the period, with a similar inflation
                    occurring in the penalties applied to these misdeeds.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laws against miscegenation—a gross immorality to most antebellum Hoosiers—offer
                    a spectacular example of this expansion of moral-order crimes. In 1818 the penalties for
                    miscegenation were mild, with a fine of one hundred dollars if the white offender was male and ten
                    days in jail if the guilty white was female. Twenty years later punishment included a fine of from
                    one thousand to five thousand dollars and a prison term of ten to twenty years.<hi rend="sup">68</hi> In sexual misdeeds where race was not a factor, there were similar, though less harsh,
                    developments. Confinement of up to ten years replaced a maximum one thousand dollar fine for incest.
                    By the mid-1840s seduction had undergone a dramatic metamorphosis from tort to felony.<hi rend="sup">69</hi> Of course, not all sexual misconduct was liable for such severe punishment. Open and
                    notorious adultery and fornication, for instance, remained mildly punishable misdemeanors, even
                    though the early 1850s witnessed a serious, if unsuccessful, effort to make them punishable by
                    prison terms.<hi rend="sup">70</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not all moral-order crimes involved copulative sins, nor were sexual crimes the most controversial.
                    Hoosier lawmakers also devoted considerable energy to regulating gambling and liquor, with new laws
                    and stiffer penalties accompanying each revision of the criminal code. Scholars have adequately

                    Indiana and elsewhere, but strictures against gambling have remained unstudied.<hi rend="sup">71</hi> This is ironic because more than one-seventh, or nine of fifty-nine, of the substantive
                    sections of the state's first criminal code dealt with this problem. Various statutes made
                    gaming contracts illegal and fined persons convicted of gaming, keeping gaming equipment, permitting
                    gaming in their house, or bringing cards into the state. Several sections required that the accused
                    post a recognizance that was forfeited if a second conviction for the same offense occurred within
                    twelve months.<hi rend="sup">72</hi> An unusual preamble to this early act explained the reason for
                    concern: gambling was "often attended with quarrels, disputes and controversies, to the
                    improverishment of many people and their families, and the ruin of the health and corruption of the
                    manners of youth."<hi rend="sup">73</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The moral tone of Indiana law suggests a modification of the notion that antebellum legislatures paid
                    diminishing attention to crimes against morality. Crime as theft may have replaced crime as sin at
                    the heart of criminal law, but it is evident that the latter offenses still concerned Hoosier
                    lawmakers. This does not mean that these laws represented a consensus on moral values. Pressure to
                    establish legal norms is often greatest where consensus is least attainable.<hi rend="sup">74</hi>
                    The renewed scrutiny of immorality coincided with the arrival of German and Irish immigrants, groups
                    which many original settlers considered incapable of meeting their standards of sobriety and
                        industriousness.<hi rend="sup">75</hi> The expansion of the list of punishable sins, therefore,
                    was partly an attempt to protect native, middle-class values against a perceived challenge by newly
                    arrived immigrant groups.</p>
            <p>The development of the criminal law suggests that by the late 1840s and 1850s the model of
                    reformative justice envisioned in Indiana's constitutions was, at best, a curious mixture
                    of reformation and retribution that symbolized the ambivalence of Hoosiers about the social purpose
                    of punishment. Many believed <list type="footnotes">

                    receipt of proper and humane instruction. Yet crime threatened the good order of society, so
                    punishment had to be sufficiently stringent to discourage recidivism and to inhibit others from
                    criminal activity. A delegate to the midcentury constitutional convention summed up the dual
                    function of Indiana's criminal law when he rhetorically asked: "Sir, what is the
                    object of all punishment? It is two-fold: the prevention of crime and the reformation of the
                        offender."<hi rend="sup">76</hi> At times these goals were in conflict, and the
                    ambivalence about which was dominant made the course of reform uncertain. When new institutions or
                    milder laws appeared incapable of effecting any large measure of stability, there was a shift away
                    from reform and toward a reliance upon more stringent punishment to ensure order. Perhaps more than
                    anything else, the law of crime and punishment in antebellum Indiana represented the hesitant,
                    fearful, often contradictory, and sometimes symbolic response of lawmakers uncertain of the
                    consequences of rapid social and economic transformation.</p>

            <p>The splendid format was made possible by support from the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana

                    black and white illustrations. It is a text to read carefully, and a book to fan through to study
                    the pictures. Without interrupting the main narrative, the author treats several individuals in
                    separate articles inserted on gray-colored pages. He also expresses some hard-hitting opinions on
                    the Klan, Governor Paul McNutt, school segregation, and other subjects. The end of the historical

                    </placeName> schools. The result is a happy combination of scholarly craft and the
                    community's own vivid recollections of its recent past.</p>
            <p>Zimmer's part of the project takes <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Rush County</region>
                    </placeName> as an illustration of "the impact of urbanization and its alter ego,
                    modernity" (vol. I, p. 181). He emphasizes economic developments, especially the decline of
                    railroads and the rise of automobiles, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rushville</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s furniture manufacturing, and agricultural change. Two chapters, about a
                    quarter of Zimmer's contribution, provide a sophisticated narrative and statistical account
                    of recent agricultural history, particularly the adoption of new technologies, changing production
                    patterns, and farm consolidation. Case studies of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> Liggett and Wayne H. Carmony farms show what those changes have meant in practice. The
                    agricultural chapters make splendid use of interviews, county agents' reports, and a
                    manuscript history by Clarence L. Spuller, who was county agent from 1943 to 1966.</p>
            <p>Zimmer also considers politics, especially school consolidation, and social topics such as family
                    life, crime, and popular amusements. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Rush County</region>
                    </placeName> followed national trends in those matters; mentioning them simply demonstrates that the
                    county is not a "changeless, bucolic backwater," though Zimmer claims that it
                    remains "quieter, more scenic, safer" and generally more liveable "than
                    its urban neighbors" (vol. I, p. 182). The historian obviously developed some affection for
                    his subject.</p>
            <p>Much of the county's social and cultural history is left entirely to local writers.
                    Residents describe their churches, congregation by congregation, in the second volume, and a few
                    informants consider the small black minority. Frank G. Evans, a black physician who grew up in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rushville</settlement>
                    </placeName> before World War II, pays a particularly interesting tribute to his home town by
                    writing that he learned about "prejudice and discrimination as a student at Indiana
                    University" and later in the army and in <placeName>

                    </placeName> (vol. I, p. 410). Many of the local contributions are equally illuminating. They are a
                    valuable complement to Zimmer's fine history.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Six of the eight brief papers in this book emphasize military and diplomatic
                    affairs—not surprising since the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> area was the scene of prolonged three-way struggles between settlers, European powers,
                    and Indians. The authors address topics relevant to the emerging canons of the
                    "new" military history; thus they only indirectly concern themselves with actual
                    fighting.</p>
            <p>In a suggestive lead article, Linda Carlson Sharp of the Indiana Historical Society Library surveys
                    some of the contemporary maps and descriptions used by rival powers before the Revolutionary War to
                    advance contending claims to North America; an area they viewed as one with vast potential but also
                    as a drain on the limited resources of the mother countries.</p>
            <p>D. R. Farrell of the University of Guelph supports Sharp's conclusions. In his essay
                    analyzing the British war effort in the West during the Revolution, he notes that "Imperial
                    resources were strained virtually to the breaking point" (p. 21). Use of Indian allies was
                    not only morally troubling but supplying them was a burden unjustified by the meager military
                    results they produced.</p>
            <p>In a review of the causes of St. Clair's defeat by a federation of Northwest tribes in 1791,
                    Patrick J. Furlong of Indiana University, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, evaluates the role of failures in bringing about St. Glair's disaster.
                    Although the logistical failures were serious, he concludes that they were not the main factor in
                    the outcome of the campaign.</p>
            <p>Military architecture, that is, the construction of frontier fortifications, is examined by David A.
                    Simmons of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society. He concludes that the wide variations found in the design of
                    frontier defenses were the result of the knowledge and experience of individual military engineers
                    along with cost factors, availability of materials, time constraints, and the nature of the enemy.</p>
            <p>Contributions by William Collins and Willian L. Potter are more narrowly focused. Collins, a
                    professor at Purdue University, reexamines the purpose and significance of the Spanish attack <pb n="380" id="VAA4025-082-4-084"/> on Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> in 1781. Potter's essay concerns the actions of widely dispersed elements of
                    the King's (or Eighth British) Regiment that manned western posts during the Revolution.
                    His essay is written with verve but is marred by disconcerting colloquialisms, poor footnote form,
                    and awkward syntax.</p>
            <p>The last two articles depart from military themes. Richard Day provides an engaging account of Michel
                    Brouillet, fur trader, militia officer, interpreter, and scout for territorial governor William
                    Henry Harrison. An interesting individual on his own account, Brouillet was builder and resident of
                    a French style house discovered and restored in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> of which Day is curator. Robert M. McCluggage of Loyola University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> analyzes pioneer stereotypes. He suggests that a less "culture bound"
                    assessment of frontier society is in order.</p>
            <p>These essays and the extensive documentation that accompanies each of them testify to the wealth of
                    materials available for reevaluating this critical area during the emergence of the new nation.</p>

                    </placeName> and Maiden during the War of 1812, John Sugden, a British historian, evaluates
                    strategies and examines myths that have baffled scholars since Tecumseh fell in the encounter near
                    Moraviantown in Upper <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> on October 5, 1813. Major General Henry Procter, who commanded the British-Indian
                    armies, fled in haste after the encounter, leaving his baggage in hands that soon put his more
                    revealing correspondence into American newspapers. Accounts of this first American overwater foreign
                    invasion have sometimes "fallen prey," as Sugden says, to "indifferent
                    primary sources that bear upon the Indians, many of which are weltered in conjecture" (p.
                    x). Sugden has diligently searched British, Canadian, and American archives to end speculation.</p>
            <p>Even with "430 large manuscript pages" of Procter's court martial and the
                    captured records in his baggage, to say nothing of the self-serving reminiscences of platoons of
                    veterans in both armies, a definitive account remains elusive. The frailties and whimsies of human
                    perception, especially under the stress and in the chaos of battle, deny even the most determined
                    researcher <pb n="381" id="VAA4025-082-4-085"/> definitive answers. Collecting the many conflicting
                    accounts into a single narrative combines confusion with frustration. The author might have enhanced
                    the coherence of his work by sparing the reader some of the accounts identified as erroneous in
                    footnotes (pp. 262–63), and the one concerning Black Hawk, who claimed to be back in his
                        <geogName>Rock River</geogName> homeland during the battle.</p>
            <p>After examining all of Sugden's evidence the reader still must ask: Who killed Tecumseh?
                    Where is he buried? Was it his body or that of another Indian that was multilated? Nor are readers
                    likely to modify previous notions about Procter, despite Sugden's assertion that the
                    British commander "was not the inhumane coward so repeatedly portrayed" (p. xi).
                    During the events covered in the book, Procter was too outnumbered to display inhumanity, and his
                    memory of Indian atrocities at <geogName>River Raisin</geogName> gave him sufficient reason to flee,
                    as he did, at Moraviantown in the face of Hoosiers and Kentuckians.</p>
            <p>Sugden's research nevertheless richly provides Indian and British perspectives lacking in
                    early American accounts, a proper emphasis on the strategic importance of Commodore Oliver Hazard
                    Perry's control of <geogName>Lake Erie</geogName>, and a reminder that the British and
                    Indians still "controlled Michillimackinac, St. Joseph, and Prairie du Chien"
                    after the battle at Moraviantown (p. 204).</p>

            <p>Journalist Robert C. Kriebel's purpose in writing this biography is an admirable one: Helen
                    Gougar, once as prominent a reformer as Susan B. Anthony and Frances Willard, has been all but
                    forgotten, and Kriebel wants to rescue her from oblivion and to pay tribute to a "native
                    daughter" of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He tells the story of Cougar's life and times in a breezy style that matches
                    the pace of this restless reformer's life.</p>
            <p>Helen Gougar married a lawyer and learned so much from assisting with his practice that in 1894 she
                    was able to challenge Indiana's election laws by attempting to vote. Her action launched a
                    test case of women's suffrage that eventually went to the Indiana Supreme Court.
                    Cougar's involvement with reform had begun thirty years earlier in the female culture of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s literary and benevolent associations. But a combative <pb n="382" id="VAA4025-082-4-086"/> temperament and strong convictions soon pushed her beyond those polite
                    circles. Gougar became a speaker whose forceful personality and good looks always drew a crowd.
                    Traveling thousands of miles a year, she gave lectures on temperance and suffrage, charging fifty to
                    one hundred dollars for each appearance. Her pace was frantic: a speaking tour during 1887, for
                    example, consisted of sixty-four lectures in five weeks.</p>
            <p>Gougar was also a journalist. She wrote a weekly column that, despite the demeaning title
                    "Bric-a-Brac," covered major issues of the day. And in 1883 she began to edit a
                    temperance weekly, <hi rend="i">Our Herald,</hi> whose motto was "Freedom and Law Know no
                    Sex." As owner-editor of a weekly she had a position of influence few nineteenth-century
                    women enjoyed.</p>
            <p>Repeated failures of the suffrage and prohibition amendments, however, eventually caused Gougar to
                    become disillusioned. The wit which had always characterized her writing ("Nine-tenths of
                    the women with brains above an oyster demand the ballot," she wrote in 1881. p. 74) turned
                    to a bitter cynicism; as a speaker she was so forceful that the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Herald</hi> described her as an "unsexed diabolical bulldozer" (p.
                    106). Her prohibition stance led to a break with Susan B. Anthony and with the Indiana suffrage
                    movement.</p>
            <p>Kriebel's biography relies almost exclusively on Gougar's writings and on newspaper
                    accounts of her speeches. While this allows the reader to enjoy the flavor of her language, it is at
                    the expense of the historical context of Gougar's life and work that secondary sources
                    could have provided. It is unfortunate that Kriebel chose not to consult the extensive historical
                    scholarship on women and reform published in the last quarter-century since Eleanor
                    Flexner's <hi rend="i">Century of Struggle</hi> (1959). Thus the central problem of why
                    Helen Gougar engaged in a lifetime of reform activities remains a mystery. Kriebel has "a
                    hunch" that her motives, as his title suggests, were religious. But this is a vague and
                    unconvincing label to pin on the flamboyant, worldly Gougar. Readers who want a more detailed and
                    sophisticated analysis of women's reform in the nineteenth century will find it in Ruth
                    Bordin's <hi rend="i">Woman and Temperance: The Quest for Power and Liberty,
                        1873–1900</hi> (1981) and Nancy Hewitt's <hi rend="i">Women's

                    Though disappointing in its failure to make connections between the life of Helen Gougar and other
                    suffrage, temperance, and feminist leaders, <hi rend="i">Where the Saints Have Trod</hi>
                    nevertheless provides the first full account of a remarkable Hoosier. It also shows how, even
                    without the vote, one woman—brilliant, wealthy, and childless—could lead a
                    remarkably full public life.</p>

            <p>Paul G. Hoffman crowded two rather distinct careers into a long and active life. From 1925 until 1948
                    he was one of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s leading citizens, working to bring Studebaker to significant levels of
                    success as "America's Friendliest Factory." From 1948 until 1971 he was
                    involved in a variety of public service efforts, beginning with the Marshall Plan and concluding
                    with the United Nations Development Program. During these careers he developed a national reputation
                    as a "progressive" business leader and a devoted champion of the efficacy of
                    foreign aid for economic development. Along with other like-minded business leaders of his day, he
                    has come to be identified with the notion of "corporatism," a term which suggests
                    an economic policy based on a conservative form of Keynesianism and a flexible attitude toward labor
                    relations. In the sphere of foreign relations Hoffman believed that foreign economic aid aimed at
                    creating markets in developing nations was the best way to achieve the goals of ensuring political
                    stability and fostering the growth of free enterprise.</p>
            <p>Alan R. Raucher's meticulously researched and well-written biography outlines the career of
                    Paul Hoffman in a generally sympathetic way. Based on a wide variety of manuscript and oral history
                    sources, including Hoffman's own papers at the Truman Library, the book relies little on
                    existing published material, although Raucher includes a lengthy and comprehensive bibliography of
                    relevant secondary sources.</p>
            <p>More often than not, biographies are criticized because the author has not been able to resist the
                    temptation to include every known fact, however trivial, about his or her subject's life,
                    making for eternally long and boring books. This is a fault which can by no means be laid at
                    Raucher's feet. His biography, in 165 pages of text, is a model of succinct writing. For
                    the readers with more than a casual interest in Hoffman, however, this succinctness can be
                    frustrating. On numerous occasions some event or activity in Hoffman's life is briefly
                    mentioned and then forgotten, leaving the reader with unanswered questions. For example, we are told
                    that Hoffman served on the Automotive Council for War Production during World War II, but we do not
                    learn how Hoffman, an anti-New Deal Republican, received the appointment, what the council did, what
                    role Hoffman played in its work, and what significance this service may have had on
                    Hoffman's later public service.</p>
            <pb n="385" id="VAA4025-082-4-089"/>
            <p>Raucher, who published an article on Hoffman's concern for automotive safety in the
                    September, 1983, issue of this journal, has given us a brief and very readable biography of an
                    individual certainly deserving of a biography. Had he fleshed out his skeleton, one could claim that
                    he had written the definitive life of Hoffman. Nonetheless, the book is worthwhile, both for its
                    explorations into the business history of the automotive industry and for its insight into various
                    economic aspects of the Cold War years.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Novus Ordo Seclorum: The Intellectual Origins of the Constitution.</hi> By Forrest
                    McDonald. (Lawrence: University Press of <placeName>

            <p>Three decades ago, when Forrest McDonald published <hi rend="i">We the People: The Economic Origins
                        of the Constitution,</hi> a book designed to clear the historical landscape of Beardian
                    remnants, he promised two sequels on the making of the Constitution. The first of these, <hi rend="i">E Pluribus Unum,</hi> appeared in 1965 and treated the political context of the
                    movement toward the Constitution. The present volume deals with the intellectual origins. The delay
                    has been fortunate. McDonald brings to the subject the fruit of a career devoted to reading and
                    contemplating the sources dealing with eighteenth-century politics. Whatever the strength of his
                    insight, or his truly impressive synthetic ability, one can doubt that the book could have been
                    written thirty or even twenty years ago. McDonald remains his own historian, singularly so in many
                    instances, but he plainly builds on the work of Robbins, Bailyn, Pocock, Colbourn, and Wood. The
                    book is both a brilliant exposition of his own views and a judicious extension of the work of the
                    last generation on the intellectual history of the revolutionary age.</p>
            <p>Ideas, for McDonald, are imbedded in experience. In the jargon of the time, he writes about the
                    sociology of ideas. The point is made in a chapter on "The Rights of Englishmen"
                    that describes the constitutional basis of the English conception of natural, legal, and
                    prescriptive rights that were to be so important in the making of American independence. Indeed he
                    sees the Constitution as an experiential document, the consequence of much practical give and take
                    among politicians of varying opinions and interests. This alone would be little advance in the
                    historiography of the subject. McDonald's contribution is in the <pb n="386" id="VAA4025-082-4-090"/> taxonomy of ideas that informed late eighteenth-century political
                    activity. The Americans were conscious revolutionaries and constitution makers, but they came at the
                    tail end of a century and a half of intense intellectual ferment. The mental constructions available
                    to them by way of motivation, explanation, or justification were of considerable
                    variety—and often enough contradictory. In McDonald's terms these included:
                    "natural-law and natural-rights theory, republican ideology of both the
                    classical-cum-puritanical and the Harringtonian-cum-Bolingbrokean variety, Montesquieu, the English
                    legal tradition, [and] the Scottish Enlightenment" (p. 144). Superimposed on these
                    categories was a vestige of the larger, distinctively English division of Court and Country which
                    persisted even into the late colonial period. By dint of painstaking and lucid exposition, McDonald
                    manages to make sense out of this vastly complex intellectual melange.</p>
            <p>Although the work on the whole is a model of dispassion, McDonald has his favorites. He has little
                    patience with Bolingbrokean conspiracy theories though he respects the effects of this mode of
                    thinking on the American experience. He prefers <placeName>

                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

                    </placeName> in the formation of the Constitution. The founding generation, he concludes, was wise
                    enough to devise "a new order out of materials prescribed by the ages," drawn
                    loosely enough to "live and breathe and change with time" (p. 293).</p>

            <p>Through the ages, whether it was the search for El Dorado, Prester John, or the River of the West,
                    grand illusions have often been the moving force behind exploring expeditions. The history of the
                    U.S. Exploring Expedition began in the 1820s as a consequence of a theory of John Cleves Symmes that
                    held that the earth was hollow and that there were openings at the poles into which ships could
                    sail. But there were also other forces that helped launch this successful expedition. Foremost among
                    them was the "important interests of our commerce embarked in the whale-fisheries, and
                    other adventures in the great Southern Ocean" (p. 43). The mission of the expedition was to
                    gather data <pb n="387" id="VAA4025-082-4-091"/> and artifacts in support of science, trade,
                    diplomacy, and navigation.</p>
            <p>In August, 1838, the six ships of the expedition set sail from Hampton Roads, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. The squadron returned four years later after a cruise of eighty-five thousand miles.
                    Under the command of Lieutenant Charles Wilkes the expedition explored and charted hundreds of
                    Pacific islands, circumnavigated the globe, identified <placeName>
                        <country reg="ay">Antarctica</country>
                    </placeName> as a continent, and mapped nearly a thousand miles of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> coast.</p>
            <p>Accompanying the several hundred naval personnel of the expedition were nine civilian naturalists,
                    known as the Scientifics, who put together a collection consisting of tens of thousands of
                    specimens. In their treasure trove were two thousand birds, one thousand corals, crustaceans, and
                    mollusks, fifty thousand plants, and thousands of other artifacts.</p>
            <p>This "interesting flotsam and jetsam," as John Wesley Powell described the
                    collection, was finally housed in the National Museum of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. To commemorate this gift to the Smithsonian Institution and to celebrate the
                    seventy-fifth anniversary of the Museum of Natural History, an exhibit honoring the expedition was
                    put on display in 1985. Out of this exhibition, titled <hi rend="i">Magnificent Voyagers,</hi> came
                    the idea for this collection of twelve essays, mainly dealing with the scientific and navigational
                    achievements of the expedition.</p>
            <p>Though a few essays, such as those on geology and the two on vertebrates and invertebrates, might be
                    too technical for the general reader, they are insightful and succinct. Other essays deal with
                    Wilkes as diplomat, the surveying of the Pacific Ocean, and the connection between the expedition
                    and the Smithsonian.</p>
            <p>This informative and well-researched volume is an important addition to the literature of American
                    exploration. The book's excellent illustrations demonstrate even better than the essays the
                    magnificent scientific achievements of the Wilkes Expedition.</p>

                    church, its founders conceived Hudson as a fresh start for New Englanders seeking to build an ideal
                    community. <hi rend="i">Hudson's Heritage</hi> is a popular account of the founding and
                    first century of that town.</p>
            <p>Grace Goulder Izant, a Hudson resident for sixty years and longtime newspaper editor and writer,
                    completed her book just before she died in 1984. It is a series of related vignettes rather than a
                    smoothly flowing chronicle. The early chapters sketch the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> background, David Hudson and other promoters, the origins of the Western Reserve, and
                    the mechanics of moving out to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> frontier. Later chapters focus on notable residents, the town's Congregational
                    church, and Western Reserve College (founded in Hudson in 1826).</p>
            <p>Gaps inevitably result from such an organizational scheme. There is little discussion of town
                    politics or of ordinary residents: who they were, their circumstances, or why they were attracted to
                    Hudson. Neither is there much economic history. It is difficult to know just what kept the town
                    going, how it may have been affected by the depressions of 1819 and 1837, or what effect the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Canal may have had on its fortunes. Izant provides somewhat more about the boom that
                    accompanied the arrival of the railroad in 1851, but she skips over the Civil War era and ends at
                    the turn of the century with the return of a Hudson native who found success in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>There is something even more frustrating than the omissions and broken chronology. Izant raises, but
                    fails to pursue, an interesting question of motivation. Why did David Hudson, and presumably others
                    like him, give up a comfortable life in the East to face the rigors of the frontier? Was it simply a
                    matter of the greater opportunity for a vastly increased material fortune, prestige, and influence?
                    Izant suggests something more. David Hudson wrote in his journal that he would move to the
                    "solitary wilds of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> Western Reserve where my former sins are unknown" and there, as atonement for
                    prior transgressions, promote a town, administer it on strict Christian principles, maintain it
                    under law and order, and support morality and education (p. 42). But in the end it is unclear how
                    his vision shaped the town of Hudson and made it unique, or perhaps typical of other frontier
                    settlements.</p>
            <p>A powerful sense of spiritual and moral rebirth may have infected other easterners with a similar
                    sense of purpose not normally associated with the frontier enterprise. Perhaps John Brown's
                    religious-inspired radicalism (<placeName>

            <p>Joseph T. Glatthaar has gone beyond the all too frequent recounting of the heroics of the great
                    military leader and the strategic placement of troops on the battlefield to provide the reader with
                    the best treatment to date of Sherman's troops in the Savannah and Carolinas campaigns. His
                    emphasis is, as the subtitle suggests, on the common soldier, and the result is a chronicle of
                    activities of real people. While the campaigns themselves only covered a period of approximately six
                    months, they were controversial and hastened the cessation of hostilities.</p>
            <p>Heading into the campaigns with an army sixty thousand strong, including several Indiana regiments,
                    Sherman introduced the concept of "total war." The success of the concept was due
                    in large measure to the character of the troops who served in his forces. Glatthaar analyzed the
                    enlistments in Sherman's forces and discovered that nearly one in every two soldiers
                    re-enlisted for three years compared to one in every thirteen for the Union forces as a whole. He
                    further calculated the general health of Sherman's Army and found that in any given month
                    there was 5 to 10 percent less illness than in the remainder of the Union Army. Election statistics
                    from the Sherman forces indicated Lincoln received 86 percent of the vote. In sum,
                    Sherman's troops were battle hardened veterans, relatively healthy, and overwhelmingly in
                    support of the Union cause and the successful prosecution of the war.</p>
            <p>The author has made extensive use of letters, diaries, and reminiscences so that the reader obtains a
                    clearer notion of the soldiers' attitudes toward blacks, southern whites, camp life,
                    foraging, destruction, and pillaging. These sources reveal that a reduction of racial prejudice
                    toward blacks had evolved by the end of the campaigns. Conversely, attitudes toward southern whites
                    were less symphathetic; many of the troops finding them to be the sole cause for the war.</p>
            <pb n="390" id="VAA4025-082-4-094"/>
            <p>The book, part of the American Social Experience Series, is precisely that, a social history of
                    Sherman's troops in these famous campaigns. Readers expecting a recounting of strategy or a
                    retelling of combat activity will be disappointed. However, there are already several fine
                    monographs on those subjects. One hopes that Glatthaar's work will act as a catalyst and
                    inspire further publications on the common soldiers' participation in campaigns under
                    individual generals on both the Union and Confederate side.</p>
            <p>This book is interesting, well written, and adequately illustrated. In sum, it would be a fine
                    addition to anyone's Civil War bookshelf.</p>

            <p>The last decade provided two significant anniversaries for the "Germans in
                    America," or, more broadly conceived—as in the title of the present
                    work—for "America and the Germans": 1976, the nation's
                    bicentennial, with an unprecedented revival of historical and genealogical
                    ("roots") interest; 1983, the three hundredth anniversary of the first German

            <p>No doubt, an anthology of this nature has its definite value both for the researcher and the novice
                    in German-Americana. In most instances the reader will find the editorial intent to have been
                    realized; that is, to reflect "the current state of scholarship," but
                    "formulated with the uninitiated reader in mind."</p>

                    Hoosier Liebers, Hermann and Richard, are not. We must not be disappointed about that. A look at and
                    an understanding of the larger contexts will help us assess our regional and local German-Americana
                    better, whether as variations of dominant patterns or as unique manifestations. Familiarity with the
                    broader context eliminates guesswork in that respect. We also stand to gain methodologically from
                    proven approaches employed by researchers on the national scale. While not all contributions in
                    these two volumes are of equal weight and scholarly thoroughness—an unavoidable
                    consequence in publishing conference papers—the reader will find a gold mine of
                    information and interpretation, including valuable bibliographical references; e.g., in the copious
                    notes of H. Wellenreuther's "Image and Counterimage, Tradition and Expectation:

            <p>The black experience, according to George C. Wright, was different in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> from what Afro-Americans experienced in other southern cities. Host to a
                    "polite form of racism" between the end of the Civil War and the Great Depression, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> offered its black community little harsh treatment and no lynchings during a period in
                    which most blacks in the urban South were the object of intimidation and violence. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s blacks also "consistently enjoyed and exercised an oft-contested
                    but never effectively retracted enfranchisement" (cover). The black vote, however, did not
                    contribute to substantial political leverage, and there were no significant improvements in the
                    quality of the civil rights of blacks. Paternalism on the part of whites "carried over from
                    antebellum days in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>" (cover), and whites helped blacks establish schools, hospitals, and other
                    institutions. Wright agrees with Howard Rabinowitz that such activities made the maintenance of
                    strict segregation easier, and that blacks generally accepted such assistance with the understanding
                    that they would refrain from advocating civil and social equality. He also develops the notion,
                    probably best expressed by Kenneth Kusmer, that blacks made the most of their position on their own,
                    and that through their own efforts they created a "diversity and richness of life"
                    in their community (p. 10).</p>
            <p>In general, Wright carries out his stated purpose most effectively. His study, which deals with a
                    southern border city, adds much to the growing body of historical literature on the black urban
                    experience. The author has consulted a variety of primary and secondary materials (although
                    unaccountably not the federal population schedules) in the pursuit of his goal, a narrative of the
                    means whereby Louisville blacks came to grips with second-class status. The reader will find some
                    unique contributions to the literature here. Especially valuable are Wright's explorations
                    of education and politics. Also his accounts of interracial organizations in the 1920s are most
                    interesting.</p>
            <p>A few matters, however, are left either untouched or superficially treated. The work begins with the
                    end of the Civil War, although frequent reference is made to the pre-1865 legacy of paternalism. An
                    introductory chapter on antebellum <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> would have been helpful. The study also contains little on the matter of occupational
                    mobility—for example, to compare the experiences of black and white
                    newcomers—and does not attempt to <pb n="393" id="VAA4025-082-4-097"/> show the
                    development of residential segregation via such devices as an index of dissimilarity. Perhaps the
                    author, moreover, could have treated the subjects raised in chapters ten and twelve (the NAACP and
                    interracial organizations of the 1920s) in one chapter, thus more coherently analyzing black
                    responses to white racism. It should be added that some illustrations would have helped, and that
                    the four maps provided in the book are not very useful.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, this is a well-researched and ably written piece, and it is an important addition to
                    the history of black Americans.</p>

                    a prelude, a time of darkness before the coming of the light, a time of corruption and
                    self-indulgence before the dawn of an era of political honesty and public-spirited service. In his

                    own right and offers a more balanced analysis of its dynamic features. It was, he argues, a critical
                    period during which the state moved from an "extractive frontier economy" to a
                    "mainly urban-centered economy operating on the leading edge of contemporary industrial
                    technology" (p. v), and during which settlement patterns changed dramatically as
                    communities sprung up in relatively unpopulated areas of the state and people gravitated toward
                    burgeoning towns and cities. It was also a period in which politics and governmental structures
                    began to respond, sometimes quite effectively, to a variety of new challenges.</p>
            <p>By organizing the book into three sections entitled "The Economy,"
                    "Communities," and "Politics and Government," Nesbit has created
                    a framework which makes the history of this complex period more accessible. Although the
                    book's final section provides a very interesting vantage point from which to assess the
                    Progressive Era which was to follow, it is the shortest of the <pb n="394" id="VAA4025-082-4-098"/>
                    three sections. Nesbit gives far more attention to the major economic changes which occurred during
                    the period and to their social impact. He includes, for example, a discussion of life styles on
                    farms, in villages, towns, and cities, and a rather extensive analysis of attitudes toward women and
                    the changing roles which women played. He also ably describes the critical importance of ethnic and
                    religious considerations in many aspects of life in that period of <placeName>

            <p>David Thelen has written a broadly interpretive book about the period between 1877 and 1917, but it
                    is a book designed to influence the present and the future as well, for he discusses the New
                    Right's usurpation of tradition in the present in an introduction and provides a statement
                    about prospects for the future in an epilogue. For Thelen there has been an ongoing struggle between
                    an old order and a new order. In his words: "This struggle occurred within an all-embracing
                    transformation of Missourians' lives that began in the early nineteenth century. In the old
                    order, family, work, leisure, friends, community, natural surroundings, and worship had interwoven
                    to form an integrated fabric. The new order's economic imperatives of competition and
                    growth drove an ever-widening wedge between economic activities and social and cultural traditions.
                    The new order replaced the authority of persons with an invisible hand that created new kinds of
                    dependence, shame, guilt, success, and failure. Soon the relentless competitive demands pushed
                    outward from the economic centers of change in markets, jobs, and business to encompass the ways
                    people relaxed, prayed, and learned. When <pb n="395" id="VAA4025-082-4-099"/> managers shaped the
                    production of only-too-visible new corporations around the new market, and when those corporations
                    assumed the power and authority that strong neighbors had wielded in the old order, Missourians
                    discovered that the soulless new corporations felt none of the traditional communal responsibilities
                    that had motivated powerful neighbors in the past" (p. 3).</p>
            <p>Railroad building played a crucial role in establishing the author's new order, and in his
                    treatment of the period, Jesse James becomes America's "Classic Social
                    Bandit." Bald Knobbers, or vigilantes, of southwest <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> represent the popular belief "that conflicts between the old and new orders
                    could not be contained within formal legal institutions" (p. 92). Public education becomes
                    a tool of the developers of the new order, but, "The developers … lost the
                    cultural war over values" (p. 116). The militia and city police forces are depicted as
                    "new military forces [trying! to compel outward obedience to [the] codes of the new order
                    as they supplanted older forms of social discipline" (p. 108).</p>
            <p>In the paragraphs above one will find much to question, including the sufficiency of evidence
                    supporting Thelen's assertions, but one may well be stimulated to think anew about <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> after the Civil War. Thelen's treatment of the Progressive movement in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, on the other hand, is superb. The author's handling of Folk, Hadley, and the
                    evolution from attacking corporate power to regulating it is well-documented and persuasively
                    argued. The author's discussion of Scott Joplin is also excellent. Some nine misspelled
                    words should have been caught by the editor.</p>

            <p>The New American Nation Series, arguably the most complete collection available in American history,
                    has long had a missing link. The first volume in the series, which began in 1954, covered the period
                    from 1912 to 1917. In it the editors told of their plans for a succeeding volume "on the
                    First World War and the collapse of Wilsonian idealism and internationalism." This gap has
                    been aptly filled by Robert H. Ferrell's book.</p>
            <pb n="396" id="VAA4025-082-4-100"/>
            <p>The volume is not a mere synthesis of secondary sources, but one that draws on the archives of four
                    countries, manuscript collections, oral histories, and the unpublished reminiscences of some of the
                    military participants in the war. The author makes particularly effective use of the diaries and
                    letters of soldiers (including that of Captain Harry S Truman) to personalize the large movements in
                    which they participated. The result is a lively and readable account of events that are still
                    shaping our lives.</p>
            <p>Ferrell movingly describes the battles of the summer of 1918, noting the valor of the new American
                    army as well as the needlessness of many of its sacrifices. But in securing victory for the Allies
                    this same American army prevented the war from ending in a negotiated settlement; a result which
                    Wilson believed was the best long-term solution to the conflict.</p>
            <p>The book begins with Wilson's request for a declaration of war and ends with the election of
                    1920. These were momentous and crowded years. But because Ferrell's book is brief (only 235
                    pages of text), there is necessarily some unevenness in the coverage, which focuses on military,
                    diplomatic, and political developments.</p>
            <p>The author is generally critical of Wilson's handling of the war, but he does not hold the
                    president responsible for flaws in the Treaty of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Versailles</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Although conceding that Wilson made some tactical errors, he ascribes the failure of
                    the peacemakers to world forces that were simply too large to be analyzed and handled.</p>
            <p>Ferrell is most critical of Wilson's efforts to obtain Senate ratification of the treaty. He
                    believes that the Senate would have approved the treaty if Wilson had made even a minimal effort to
                    understand his opponents. The author attributes the president's reluctance to court
                    congressional support to his innate shyness and his tendency to view political issues in terms of
                    black and white. The resulting struggle brought Wilson's "brilliant political
                    career to a pitiful end" (p. 156).</p>

            <p>From the stage of the Grand Ole Opry on April 19, 1986, came the announcement by Bobby Osborne of the
                    internationally famous Osborne Brothers bluegrass group that, "Tonight, <pb n="397" id="VAA4025-082-4-101"/> we are privileged to have in the audience Neil Rosenberg, author of a
                    new book called <hi rend="i">Bluegrass: A History.</hi>" Such recognition, heard by a radio
                    audience all over the eastern part of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, likely indicates how the bluegrass music industry in general feels about
                    Rosenberg's newest contribution to the growing field of bluegrass literature.</p>
            <p>Originating in the Upper South in the 1930s and 1940s, bluegrass music developed into a distinct
                    genre in the 1950s thanks to the talents of such musicians as Bill <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> and the Bluegrass Boys (the group that started the bluegrass sound), Lester Flatt and
                    Earl Scruggs, the Stanley Brothers, and the Osborne Brothers, among a host of others. Bluegrass
                    music in its pristine form relies chiefly on acoustic, nonelectric, string instruments; rapid tempo;
                    and a tight vocal harmony that is pitched higher than country music.</p>
            <p>Rosenberg's study focuses on the bluegrass groups that religiously define(d) their music
                    according to these characteristics. It is, as the title of the book indicates, a history of the
                    genre's origins and developments, rather than a technical treatment of the music or a
                    textual analysis of the songs performed by the musicians. This valuable book, however, is more than
                    just a genealogy of bluegrass bands: it places the music in the larger context of American musical
                    currents. For example, the affinity of bluegrass with commercial gospel music and the urban folk
                    revival is spelled out clearly, as is the tension between bluegrass, rock and roll, and country
                    music.</p>
            <p>Rosenberg spent fifteen years researching and writing what may very well be his magnum opus. His
                    persistent quest for information led him to trade publications, phonograph recordings, published
                    oral histories, tape-recorded interviews, discographies, and songbooks. The resulting twelve
                    chapters are full of new information and provide rich insights into an art form that Rosenberg
                    himself has been performing since before our days together as graduate students in folklore at
                    Indiana University during the early 1960s.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Bluegrass: A History</hi> is well written in clear prose, and the text is augmented with
                    illuminating photographs of the performers. But the book is not particularly suited for pleasure
                    reading as it is weighted down with miniscule facts. Even devotees and scholars will have some
                    trouble in this regard, for every item of information is presented as if it were as important as
                    every other one. Within chapters, topics of varying degrees of significance are given equal
                    treatment. As a result, there is no real sense of proportion in the book. With its encyclopedic
                    character, however, this book will serve as a (perhaps as the) standard reference on the subject for
                    many years to come.</p>
