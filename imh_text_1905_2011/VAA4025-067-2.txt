                  The common roads of the

                             are inferior to those of any other civilized country. Their faults are
                        those of direction, of slopes, of shape, of surface, and generally of deficiency in all the
                        attributes of good roads.

                    Our people have not been in the habit of looking to the English colonies, at this day, for models
                        of enterprize … but It is as true as it is mortifying, that our provincial neighbors
                        across the Lakes are vastly in advance of us with regard to this, the great road improvement of
                        the age.

            The possibility of surfacing common country roads with sawed lumber, an innovation which for a brief
                    time promised to revolutionize rural transportation, received public notice in the 
                        United States
                     as early as 1843. In that year, a series of articles describing the construction of
                    plank roads in 
                        Canada
                     was published in the 
                        Rochester
                    
                    Democrat and widely copied in other 
                        New York
                     papers. At the same time a short, unsigned communication "On Plank Roads in 
                        Canada
                    " was appended to the annual report of the 
                        United States
                     commissioner of patents. This anonymous letter concluded, after sketching Canadian
                    experience with such thoroughfares, that they were at the least potentially valuable improvements
                    for regions where stone was scarce and timber abundant.2
            
            Interest in country and interurban plank roads increased in upper 
                        New York
                     during the following year. One group of promoters not only organized to build a plank
                    road from 
                        Syracuse
                     to the town of Central Square but also sent one of its number to 
                        Canada
                     to investigate the feasibility of importing this northern innovation to the 
                        United States
                    . Other New Yorkers organized similar companies, and

                            sharply from the well known corduroy roads. Whereas the former consisted of a smooth surface
                            of sawed lumber laid on a carefully prepared foundation, the latter, which had been in
                            common use throughout the continent for some decades, were made by laying whole logs across
                            a roadbed at right angles to its course. Such cheap and easily constructed roads were often
                            laid in swampy sections of newly opened frontier areas. However, because they were
                            intolerably rough and quick to decay, they were usually replaced by less crude thoroughfares
                            as a region developed. Edwin C. Guillet, The Story of Canadian Roads (
                                Toronto
                            , 1967), 59-63.
               
                     in April, 1844, the state assembly's Committee on Roads
                    and Bridges presented a special report on "various petitions for the incorporation of
                    sundry plank road companies." It noted that "all the applications for plank or
                    timber road charters proceed from the northwestern portion of our State … and have
                    doubtless been prompted and stimulated by similar improvements in the neighboring provinces of Upper
                    and 
                        Lower Canada
                    ." After reporting that investigations in the British provinces had shown the
                    utility of the innovation, the committee predicted that such roads would complete "an
                    entire and beneficial revolution" in the upper parts of the state.3
            
            The system of road building to which New Yorkers were beginning to devote their attention had been in
                    use in 
                        Upper Canada
                     for nearly a decade. Apparently, the first road in North America to receive a plank
                    surface had been finished near 
                        Toronto
                     in 1836. Although the Rebellion of 1837 had retarded the spread of the improvement, the
                    provincial Board of Works had undertaken a program of construction in 1839. By 1861 the governments
                    of Upper and 
                        Lower Canada
                     had laid 162 miles of planking and private companies 214 more.4 To
                    a degree the popularity of the roads was based on their low cost and the availability of materials.
                    Even more they commended themselves to the public by their smoothness. A number of delighted
                    travelers thought them "as smooth as a billiard table" and compared riding on them
                    to gliding across a carpet or the floor of a ballroom.5
            
            As knowledge of Canadian success with this improvement spread, a plank road craze developed in
                    northwestern 
                        New York
                    . According to official sources the state's first such highway was put into
                    operation near 
                        Syracuse
                     in July, 1846. Within a year the increase of applications for charters and the demand
                    for a simple method of incorporation caused the legislature to enact a general law for the
                    organization of plank road companies. Fifty-two companies were organized under this act in 1848,
                    eighty in 1849, and about two hundred more in the 1850s.6 The enthusiasm also
                    spread to 
                        Pennsylvania

                    , where the innovation was especially popular in the state's isolated southern
                    section. Throughout the Middle Atlantic states some seven hundred companies were chartered and about
                    seven thousand miles of plank highways completed by 1857.7
            
            This new development in transportation did not go unnoticed by nationally circulated publications. In
                    1847 Hunt's Merchants' Magazine responded with a descriptive
                    article entitled "Plank Roads–New Improvement." Niles' Weekly Register commented two years later that plank roads were
                    "growing into universal favor."8 By the early 1850s, when
                    plank highways had become an integral part of the 
                        economy
                     of upstate 
                        New York
                    , national journals began to celebrate their virtues. The 
                        New York
                    
                    Tribune praised their ease of construction and stated that the roads added
                    immensely to the transportation facilities of the state, while the Scientific
                    American wrote that these roads would be the means for "completely reforming the
                    interior or rural transit trade of our country." Hunt's Magazine
                    commented editorially that "every section of the country should be lined with these
                    roads," and published an article which claimed that "the plank road is of the
                    class of canals and railways. They are the three great inscriptions graven on the earth by the hand
                    of modern science. … In the list of improvements which have given to this age the
                    character which it will bear in history above all others–the age of happiness to the
                    people–the plank road will bear a prominent place …"9
            
            For people seriously interested in building a plank road, such general testimonials to their
                    advantages were hardly satisfactory sources of practical information. To satisfy the need for
                    detailed technical knowledge, 
                        New York
                     experts published several elaborate plank road manuals during the early years of the
                    enthusiasm. In 1847 a report of the state Senate's Committee on Roads and Bridges included
                    a detailed discussion of the construction and operation of plank roads. Three years later George
                    Geddes, the engineer of the first 
                        New York
                     road, published his Observations on Plank Roads, and in 1851 another 
                        New York
                     engineer, William Kingsford, brought out his History, Structure and

                    the Principles and Practice of Road-Making by William M. Gillespie, a professor of
                    engineering at 
                        Union

            These authorities agreed on most issues arising from the "recent innovation of covering
                    roads with planks." Although sometimes acknowledging that such roads were a "new
                    and untried experiment" whose novelty might be responsible for some of the interest shown
                    in them, they quickly passed on to unqualified endorsements of the advantages of the improvement.11 According to these men the function of the new roads could be summed up in a
                    single sentence: "Plank roads are the Farmer's
                    Railroads." Although railroads were considered superior to plank roads for long
                    distances and for the transport of extremely heavy or bulky goods, plank roads were preferable for
                    "the home use–for the transit which is begun and ended in a day …
                    which increases the happiness and profit of the farm." There was further consensus that
                    such highways were valuable not only for the farmer who wanted to haul his produce to market but
                    also for "many thriving villages … whose business would not warrant the
                    construction of a railroad" but which nevertheless needed "convenient avenues to
                    and from their locations." Plank roads, in short, were "the feeders of railroads
                    and canals," of more use to the country's farming than to its commercial
                        population.12
            
            In describing the essentials of plank road construction, these writers followed closely the methods
                    worked out in 
                        Canada

                     engineers would have argued with the following summary of building techniques:
                    "In the most generally approved system, two parallel rows of small sticks of timber (called
                    indifferently sleepers, stringers, or sills) are imbedded in the
                    road, three or four feet apart. Planks, eight feet long and three or four inches thick, are laid
                    upon these sticks, across them, at right angles to their direction. A side track of earth, to turn
                    out upon, is carefully graded. Deep ditches are dug on each side, to ensure perfect drainage; and
                    thus is formed a Plank Road."14 In addition, the surface of the road
                    was frequently covered with fine gravel or sand to protect it from horseshoes and steel rimmed
                    wheels, and the edges of the planks were staggered so

                     that wagons could more easily turn onto the road. If the planks
                    were not spiked down, dirt was heaped over their ends to help hold them in place. For all except the
                    most heavily traveled roads it was thought sufficient to lay a single track of eight foot planks
                    paralleled by a track of dirt on which vehicles could turn out to pass. Instructions for building
                    plank roads also stressed that the planks should lie directly on the surface of the ground since any
                    air allowed underneath caused dry rot. Moreover, experts warned that mud would squeeze between the
                    planks of a poorly drained road, fouling the surface and creating cavities beneath. There was,
                    however, serious disagreement on how best to overcome these technical problems. Some engineers
                    believed that very light stringers would settle into the earth, keeping the planks on the soil.
                    Others argued, against strong opposition, that stringers formed a kind of trough which held water
                    under the road and should therefore be dispensed with altogether.15
            
            Agitation for plank roads in the middlewestern states followed closely on the initial interest in 
                        New York
                    . In the latter part of 1844 and the first months of 1845 
                        Indianapolis
                     and 
                        Fort Wayne
                     editors commented on the innovation, and newspapers in 
                        Cleveland
                     and 
                        Chicago
                     reported series of meetings, called for the promotion and organization of plank road
                        companies.16 From 
                        Cleveland
                     a committee of interested citizens dispatched an emissary to investigate the
                    construction of plank roads in 
                        Canada
                     and published a report in the 
                        Cleveland

                    Newberry, obtained a charter early in 1845 and also sent an engineer to 
                        Canada
                     to bring back first hand information.17 In none of the cities,
                    however, did this activity produce results. In 1846 plank roads were still considered an
                    "experiment," and a 
                        Chicago
                     magazine remarked that the possibility of constructing such

                            on the right side coming into town, so that farm vehicles carrying heavy loads to market
                            would have the right of way.

            After this apparent hiatus interest in plank roads began to revive in the Middle West in 1847.
                    Articles appeared in newspapers from Indiana to

                         Farmer carried an editorial advocating the planking of roads, and the
                    region's first such highway was finished in 1847 between Milwaukee and Watertown.19 By the following year the issue was being discussed and companies organized
                    in every state of the Old Northwest. The interest in rural plank roads was perhaps increased by a
                    simultaneous application of the new surfacing technique to the formidable problem of paving the
                    streets of western cities.20 So rapidly did interest burgeon that four
                    middle-western states–
                  Michigan,
                            Wisconsin
               , Indiana, and 
                        Illinois
                    –set up standardized procedures for the incorporation of plank road companies
                    by the spring of 1849.21
            
            To satisfy the need of middlewesterners for reliable information on both the economic advantages and
                    the methods of construction of plank roads, western magazines carried numerous articles on such
                    highways.

                            planking in 1849, laying twenty-seven miles of such pavement by 1854. Bessie L. Pierce, A History of

                    roads in that part of the country," and summarized a report to the 
                        Wisconsin
                     territorial Council. In addition the Western Journal and Civilian
                    published an original discussion of plank roads by Joseph E. Ware of 
                        St. Louis
                     and agitated in its editorial columns for their construction.23
            
            Middlewestern newspapers which printed letters and reports by local experts and extracts from eastern
                    publications were an additional source of technical information for plank road builders.24 Customarily, however, newspapers played a more direct role in the generation
                    of the plank road mania. A typical western editor considered the boosting of his locality his chief
                    journalistic task and had little hesitation about making himself the champion of a new
                    transportation improvement. John Wentworth's 
                        Chicago
                    
                    Democrat, for example, carried article after article about plank roads, and 
                        Indianapolis
                     editors assured their readers that plank roads were a pleasant and practical means of
                    travel rather than an experiment.25 In 
                        Cleveland
                     the Daily True Democrat repeatedly asked its readers why the city had
                    no such roads, delivered lectures on their value, and in 1851 trumpeted: "Push on these
                    highways of the people." In 
                        Missouri
                     the editor of the 
                        Columbia
                    
                    Weekly Statesman similarly made the advocacy of local plank roads the paramount
                    issue for his paper in 1851.26
            
            This local emphasis in middlewestern newspapers fitted with the normal business organization of plank
                    road companies, most of which were promoted, financed, and controlled by the inhabitants of the
                    regions which they served. In the usual case a small group of promoters planted publicity in local
                    papers, secured a charter, and peddled stock by holding a series of public meetings in the counties
                    traversed by the road.27 In some instances promoters also secured public aid for

                     project.28 After sufficient stock had been
                    subscribed and payments had begun to trickle in, the company was ready to order lumber and to put
                    the first few miles under contract, usually building outward from the most important town served.
                    Since cash was scarce in most parts of the Middle West, stock usually sold slowly and in small
                    amounts and was often paid for with deeds to real estate or promises of labor. As a consequence two
                    or three years sometimes were required to build a road fifteen or twenty miles long.29
            
            Once their highway was in operation, the builders of a plank road reaped their profits from the tolls
                    they charged on the passage of horsemen, vehicles, and animals. Maximum rates were set for the
                    earlier roads in their individual charters and for the later by the general state laws under which
                    they were incorporated. Although the rates varied from state to state, they were somewhat higher in
                    the Middle West than in 
                        New York
                    .30 Because construction costs were low and roads were short, the
                    total investment in each company was usually measured in the tens of thousands of dollars. A good
                    return on capital might therefore be expected with a small amount of traffic.31
            
            The enthusiasm for plank roads was perhaps stronger in 
                        Ohio
                     than in any other state during the late forties. Nine companies were chartered during
                    the initial attention in 1845, eight with the revival of interest in 1848, and thirty-seven in 1849.
                    Eighty-nine companies were incorporated in 1850, but only sixty-two the following year. The
                    innovation was most popular in the northern half of the state, especially in the counties within
                    forty miles of Lake Erie. A number of roads were also incorporated in the state's hilly
                    eastern section. Almost none, however, were built in the 
                        Miami
                     and lower Scioto valleys.32 Instead, the

                     relied on numerous macadamized turnpikes built during the
                    previous fifteen years.33
            
            The onset of the excitement in 
                        Michigan
                     was contemporaneous with activity in 
                        Ohio
                    . Several dozen charters were granted in 1848, and the press of work forced the
                    legislature to pass the West's first general plank road act in March of that year. During
                    the next several years such roads proved "highly profitable" to their builders and
                    "very popular" with the public. Moreover, they played an important part in the
                    state's 
                        economy
                    , not only linking its smaller towns but also connecting such cities as Lansing and
                    Grand Rapids to the slowly developing rail network.34
            
            In Indiana the interest in plank roads was more widespread than in 
                        Ohio
                     but somewhat later to develop. The state's first plank roads were finished in
                    1849 near 
                        Indianapolis
                     and 
                        Fort Wayne
                    .35 Governor Joseph A. Wright commented to the General Assembly in
                    that year that "no public improvement seems to commend itself to the public with more
                    favor," while the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Journal noted that plank roads were attracting attention all over the state.36 In 1850 both the 
                        Madison
                    
                    Courier and the Indiana Statesman noted the prevalence of a
                    "plankroad spirit."37 At the same time Robert Dale Owen, who
                    had been sent by an Indiana company "to visit that portion of western 
                        New York
                     where plank roads were first introduced into this country," published his
                    observations in a book widely disseminated and highly acclaimed by Indiana editors. Within a hundred
                    or so pages he excitely endorsed the improvement, discussed the methods of construction and economic
                    advantages of plank roads, and recommended the writings of Geddes and Gillespie.38 By the following year 400 miles of such highways were in use and hundreds more near
                        completion.39

                            progressively smaller stones. The whole surface was bonded together by the weight of passing

                     Newspapers continued to propose new projects in 1852 and 1853,
                    and plank roads served most of the state's larger towns, from 
                        Madison
                    , 
                        New Albany

            The timing of the plank road fervor in 
                        Illinois
                     was much like that in Indiana. The state's first such road was finished near 
                        Chicago
                     in September, 1848.41 Its financial success set off a wave of
                    charter applications to which the General Assembly responded by passing a general plank road
                    incorporation law early in 1849.42 During the next three years plank roads were
                    built into surrounding farm lands from most of the important towns in the northern part of the
                        state.43 Newspapers reported that the roads returned excellent profits and
                    that their stock was in great demand.44 Even as interest in railroads began to
                    take hold, editors continued to diagnose the existence of a "plank road fever,"
                    and perhaps 600 miles were put into operation by the end of 1851.45
            
            
               
                        Wisconsin
                     experienced a similar burst of plank road agitation in 1848. Newspapers were filled
                    with letters and reports of meetings in the wake of the financial success of the state's
                    first plank road, and the territorial legislature incorporated sixteen companies.48 The state Senate's Committee on Internal Improvements reported that "the
                    public mind throughout the state is largely occupied with the subject of road improvements"
                    and recommended to those interested in detailed information about the economic value, financial
                    prospects, and construction of plank roads a well researched report prepared by Philo White and
                    presented to the territorial Council earlier in the year.47 In the next several
                    years lake towns built numerous roads into the grain growing counties in the center of the state and

                     much of their growth to "the advantage of a plank
                        road."48 Many of the projects were backed by prominent citizens,
                    and few had trouble raising needed funds, especially after the legislature voted to allow
                    municipalities to purchase the stock of such corporations. As 
                        Wisconsin
                     booster, John Gregory, wrote in 1853, "it would be difficult to enumerate all
                    the plank roads built, in progress, and in contemplation."49
            
            The craze for plank roads in 
                        Iowa
                     and 
                        Missouri
                     was less widespread and of shorter duration than in the states of the Old Northwest.
                    The first charters in 
                        Missouri
                     were issued in 1849, and activity reached it height in 1851 when the legislature set up
                    standard procedures for "the formation of associations to construct plank
                        roads."50 In the same year interest also peaked in 
                        Iowa
                     as the various Mississippi River towns sought to tap the valleys
                    of the Des Moines and Iowa rivers. In the town of 
                        Burlington
                    , a center of the craze, promoter James Grimes wrote to his father in February, 1851:
                    "We have a great railroad and plank-road fever here now. We have nearly completed a
                    plank-road thirty miles west of this place. I am president of the company … and I think
                    it will pay well." As in 
                        Missouri
                    , however, interest in plank roads began to dwindle almost as the first roads were
                    finished. Only fifty miles of road were actually laid and the state chartered only fourteen
                    companies during the entire course of the enthusiasm.51
            
            Besides building plank roads during the late forties and early fifties, westerners also discussed at
                    length their value and advantages. Some writers were so carried away that they praised the
                    innovation as one of the great improvements of the age. A 
                        Burlington
                     correspondent linked them with railroads and steamboats as one of the
                    century's greatest inventions, and an Illinoisian wrote simply: "God bless the man
                    who invented the plank road." In 
                        St. Louis
                     the Intelligencer contended that the general plank road law was the
                    most significant

                        Missouri
                     legislature.52 More practical writers stressed that plank roads
                    were particularly suited to the needs of the West. The editor of the Western Journal
                        and Civilian considered them "better adapted to the condition and general economy
                    of our state, than any other mode of improvement yet discovered." The 
                        Wisconsin
                     Senate's Internal Improvements Committee thought that the "peculiar
                    adaptation of plank roads to the physical condition and business wants of 
                        Wisconsin
                    " made them the "ne plus ultra" of road making. Owen summed
                    up the same idea: "These roads are as certain to become universal in Indiana and other
                    forest-covered States, as men are certain, when the choice between one dollar and five dollars is
                    offered to them, to select the latter."53
            
            Westerners agreed with 
                        New York
                     authorities in their appraisal of the economic functions of plank roads, believing that
                    such highways would supply traffic for other lines of transportation. Governor Wright of Indiana,
                    for example, asserted that they would become "the channels through which the surplus
                    products of the country will find an outlet to the great thoroughfares of the state."54 Missourians valued plank roads as potential feeders of their state's
                    river commerce; Milwaukeans, as auxiliaries of the town's lake trade.55
                    At 
                        Fort Wayne
                     they were built "in aid of the business of the canal," and Chicagoans
                    hoped that they would feed their city's canal boats, schooners, and freight cars.56
            
            Time and again western advocates emphasized that plank roads were not a substitute for railroads and
                    assured their readers that a community which committed itself to improving its highways did not by
                    that action forego its chance to be linked to the nation's growing rail net.57 Conversely, enthusiasts argued that railroads could not themselves replace the plank
                    road since farmers would still need good roads on which to haul their produce to rail depots and
                    market towns.58 Even the 
                        Michigan
                     Central and 
                        Illinois
                     Central railroads agreed with this latter opinion. The 
                        Michigan
                     Central informed its stockholders

                     in 1850 that the construction of a number of plank roads
                    promised to give "all the advantage of so many branches, without the inconvenience and loss
                    which generally result from … small branch Railroads"; in 1853 the management of
                    the 
                        Illinois
                     Central considered transporting free of charge lumber for plank roads built from its
                    depot towns.59 The consensus on the differing economic functions of the two
                    modes of transportation was stated by Owen: "Each … has its appropriate sphere;
                    the railway as a great, leading thoroughfare … the plank road to afford communication
                    between smaller towns and villages, to form neighborhood and cross-roads, often at right angles to a
                    railroad line, supplemental to it, and terminating at its stations."60
            
            These improved facilities for local transportation were expected to be especially valuable to
                    farmers. Promoters of individual roads attempted with at least occasional success to muster
                    financial support in the country through which their highways would pass by stating that land values
                    would rise, that crops could be sold for a larger profit, and that it would become more feasible to
                    market firewood in neighboring towns.61 Even writers with less of a personal
                    interest at stake concurred that for all types of farmers "no scheme was ever devised that
                    afforded so rich an assurance of immediate and positive benefits." A railroad executive
                    agreed that "this kind of Road for moderate distances, appears better adapted to the wants
                    of such an agricultural population as ours than any other."62
            
            Westerners realized that any enhancement of the ability of farmers to market their produce would also
                    increase the business of the region's commercial centers. In 
                        Cleveland
                     the Daily True Democrat asserted that the completion of plank roads
                    to Wooster and 
                        Warren
                     would help the city's trade more than all the railroads in contemplation. 
                        Fort Wayne
                     citizens hoped that the construction of a system of plank roads to supplement the 
                        Wabash
                     and Erie Canal would sharply increase the town's commerce; Chicagoans and
                    Toledoans anticipated that their cities' roads would act as a tonic for an uneven retail
                        trade.83 At the same time residents of smaller centers saw in

                     plank roads a means by which they could contest for the
                    commercial mastery of agricultural hinterlands. While 
                  Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati
               , and other cities contended with canals, railways, and
                    steamboats for trade of entire states, lesser towns sought by rival highway improvements to become
                    the commercial centers of their surrounding counties.
            After describing the role which plank roads could be expected to play in the region's 
                        economy
                    , western advocates customarily turned to the innovation's advantages over
                    other transportation facilities. Apparently no one seriously claimed that plank roads were superior
                    to railroads in their physical capacity to carry goods, but some writers did suggest that they were
                    economically more practicable improvements for frontier communities. They could be built for about
                    one tenth the cost of railroads and they were more practical for daily use because they could be
                    successfully operated with a low volume of traffic.64 In addition, plank roads
                    were public thoroughfares open to all rather than incorporated monopolies whose profits enriched a
                    few capitalists and whose policies might discriminate against individuals or communities.65
            
            Enthusiasts were more generally agreed that plank highways were in every way preferable to other
                    types of roads. Plank road boosters usually dismissed dirt roads with the comment that a team could
                    draw three times, or four times, or six times as much on a plank surface.66
                    Proponents also claimed that plank roads were superior to the well regarded macadamized turnpikes
                    because planks offered considerably less resistance to the passage of vehicles than did broken stone
                    surfaces. They more often stressed, however, that plank roads were both easier and cheaper to build,
                    especially in the level lands around the Great Lakes where stone was scarce and
                    pine boards cheap.67 Many discussions make it clear that plank roads were valued

                     as a substitute for macadamized highways largely because they
                    could be built with little money, little effort, and little skill in engineering.68 They seemed, in other words, a perfect improvement to be adopted in the poor and
                    underdeveloped states of the Middle West. As one writer said, "plank roads ought to be
                    constructed where want of sufficient capital precludes the possibility of building a
                        better."69
            
            Despite the ease of constructing plank roads and their undisputed value to the community, it is
                    unlikely that many businessmen would have sunk money injthem had there not been some basis on which
                    to hope for a good return on the capital invested. The 
                        New York
                     writers on whom westerners drew heavily for information customarily cited the favorable
                    financial experience of 
                        New York
                     companies and stressed that any heavily used road would surely yield a profit.70 Western authorities, who placed considerable reliance on the reported success
                    of early eastern roads, also found their expectations confirmed by the high dividends declared by
                    the first roads in the vicinities of 
                        Chicago
                     and Milwaukee.71 In the early fifties it was commonly thought that
                    well made plank roads would be "monstrously" profitable; none would pay less than
                    ten per cent, many would pay twenty per cent, and some were forecast to return thirty or forty per
                    cent per year.72
            
            The hope that plank roads would yield a profit was predicated in part on their low initial cost. Even
                    more, however, it was based on the belief that the surface of such a road would last for about ten
                    years after it was laid. Western entrepreneurs could confirm this expectation by reference to
                    eastern experts who agreed that softwood planks would last seven or eight years and hardwood almost
                        twelve.73 Early western writers, who had no firsthand experience on which to
                    base their estimates, simply paraphrased

                     sanguine estimates that many companies based their calculations
                    of the profits they could anticipate and the funds they would need for repairs.75
            
            As plank road companies began to discover in the early fifties, however, planks decayed with
                    unexpected rapidity. To be sure, westerners were aware that it was imperative to guard against
                    deterioration. Since it was thought that the presence of air underneath a road reduced its life by
                    as much as two thirds, authorities warned particularly that "the plank should
                        rest solidly and immoveably on the ground."
               76 When the first
                    roads wore less well than anticipated,. plank road advocates retained their optimism and proposed
                    that the unexpected problem could easily be overcome. They advocated the use of oak instead of pine
                    and recommended the avoidance of heavy stringers which might hold the planks off the ground.77 In fact, however, such simple measures could not take care of the problem of
                    decay. In the soggy prairies, where plank roads were popular, it proved impossible to keep the roads
                    properly drained. At times, spring floods even floated planks off roadbeds and scattered them over
                    the countryside. When the rains abated, the sun warped and twisted planks until the roads were
                    unusable. Under such conditions, many plank pavements disintegrated in less than two years.78
            
            The effects of such unexpectedly rapid deterioration were disastrous for many plank roads. Since most
                    companies had expected to get close to a decade of service from their planks, few had made any
                    effort to set aside a sinking fund adequate to repave their roads within a few years. Some firms,
                    seeing a bleak future ahead, paid out all their earnings as dividends. Other roads lacked enough
                    revenue to meet even the low costs of day to day operation. As planks rotted, traffic declined and
                    farmers became less and less willing to pay tolls, leaving the corporations with even less money for
                    maintenance and with no hope for future profits. In many instances firms escaped this hopeless
                    spiral by abandoning their roads entirely, leaving the boards

            The experience of the Central Plank Road Company of Indiana shows the way in which financial problems
                    doomed such thoroughfares. Organized in 1849 to plank the segment of the National Road passing
                    through 
                  Hancock, Marion,
                            Hendricks
               , and 
                        Putnam
                     counties, the corporation quickly ran into difficulties. The initial coat of the road
                    was high, averaging $2,300 per mile, and receipts were low. The road returned profits of
                    only ten per cent even when no allowance was made for the replacement of planks, and as early as
                    1851 the firm's officers questioned whether it would be possible to finance repaving. At
                    the same time the management had to cope with a controversy over the collection of tolls near 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Within a few years much of the surface had rotted or had been removed, and the company
                    had abandoned efforts to overcome its problems. The 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Freie Presse complained: "Fürs Halsbrechen Zoll zu bezah-len,
                    ist etwas hart."80
            
            Because of the prohibitive cost of maintaining a usable surface, plank roads vanished from most parts
                    of the West as rapidly as they had appeared. Apparently, no new roads were commenced after 1854 in 
                        Ohio
                    , Indiana, 
                  Illinois, Missouri
               , or 
                        Iowa
                    . By 1855 most Indiana roads had been abandoned and only 150 miles were operating in 
                        Illinois
                    . Two years later 
                        Ohio
                     had only thirty-nine miles in use.81 Similarly, most roads in 
                        Missouri
                     and 
                        Iowa
                     were forsaken by the middle of the decade. By 1858 a western paper could use
                    "worn-out plank-road" as a synonym for something dead and useless.82

                        keeping them in repair. In 1854, only seven years after the enactment of the general
                        incorporation law which had given the enthusiasm its first official sanction, the 
                            New York

                        to resurface them with gravel. Almost all eastern companies which survived the middle of the
                        decade were destroyed by the Panic of 1857. Durrenberger, Turnpikes, 151;

            In the upper Midwest, on the other hand, plank roads survived a few years longer. Six new roads were
                    chartered in 
                        Minnesota
                     in 1854 and thirty-three in 
                        Wisconsin
                     between 1854 and 1856; at least 300 miles of plank highway were still in use near 
                        Detroit
                     in 1855.83 In the later fifties, however, the roads were also
                    abandoned in the lower parts of these states, "for however valuable they might be as wagon
                    roads, for a limited distance," they were unable to meet the needs of rapidly growing
                    commercial cities.84 Only in the counties bordering the 
                        Michigan
                     and 
                        Wisconsin
                     pineries did the cheapness of lumber make possible the continued construction of plank
                        roads.83
            
            From start to finish, therefore, the enthusiasm for plank roads lasted for little more than a decade
                    in the Middle West. Despite the initial interest in 1845 the real onset of the craze awaited the
                    apparent success of the first 
                        New York
                     roads in 1846 and 1847, the publicity given these roads by Hunt's
                        Magazine and Gillespie's Manual, and the passage of the 
                        New York
                     plank road law, which may have seemed a kind of official seal of approval. Certainly
                    western advocates in the late forties found it useful to stress the prosperous outcome of the
                    experiment in the East. The center of the excitement, moreover, lay along the shores of the
                        Great Lakes, where contact with 
                        New York
                     and 
                        Canada
                     was most frequent. From 1845 through 1848 interest centered in the flat, wet lands of
                    northern 
                        Ohio
                    , northern Indiana, eastern 
                        Wisconsin
                    , and 
                        Michigan
                    , spreading into hillier areas across the 
                        Mississippi
                     and in the Ohio Valley only in 1849 and 1850.86
            
            The rapid dissipation of interest in 1853, 1854, and 1855 can be attributed in large part to the fact
                    that roads built in the first years of the fad had begun to reveal their drawbacks by the early
                    fifties. At the same time, railroads crowded plank roads from the public mind. By 1854 and 1855
                    every small town had its railroad hopes and its railroad projects which absorbed capital and
                    entrepreneurial talent that a few years earlier would have been devoted to the promotion of plank
                    roads. Only in areas where lumber was extraordinarily cheap did the outmoded improvement last beyond
                    1857.
            The eagerness with which westerners seized upon the idea of plank roads clearly reflected the
                    miserable condition of the region's

                     common roads and the exorbitant cost of moving goods between
                    farms and local markets. Americans were well aware, as one plank road advocate put it, that
                    "no country can prosper as long as its farmers and miners haul their products and imports
                    on wagons over natural roads."87 To a large extent the very seriousness
                    of the problem contributed to the failure of plank roads by disposing otherwise sober businessmen to
                    receive a potential solution with too little common sense and too many optimistic miscalculations.
                    In any event, the discrediting of plank roads in both East and West "left most short-haul
                    transportation literally stuck in the mud, there to remain until the later age of the rigid-surface
                    road and the internal combustion engine."88

            "Give A Buck To Save A College": The Demise of Central Normal College
            
                    Kent D. Beeler and Philip C. Chamberlain∗
               
                
            June 3, 1971, is an anniversary of special significance for the town of Danville, Indiana. On that
                    day twenty years ago the community held a parade in an attempt to raise money to save its prized
                    possession and important asset–the local college. In April, 1951, the trustees of
                    Canterbury College, the five year successor to Central Normal College which had operated in 
                        Danville
                     for a period of sixty-eight years, had declared that they had exhausted all hope of
                    keeping the institution open beyond the current school year.1 The parade was a
                    money raising venture planned by local citizens with the theme "Give A Buck To Save A
                    College" and represented a last ditch effort to keep the college going.2
            
            The college was a source of pride to the community for it had contributed more than its share of
                    graduates who had distinguished themselves as doctors, lawyers, public officials, teachers, and
                    businessmen. At the time of the financial difficulty "approximately one-third of the
                    teachers in Indiana schools claimed credit for courses taught" at the school;3 a reporter in 1926 asserted that "at one time some years ago …
                    twenty-seven officials and deputies in the [Indiana] Statehouse" were former students.4 Among the notable alumni were several appellate court judges and an Indiana
                    Supreme Court justice, Arch N. Bobbitt; the state's twenty-seventh governor later elected 
                        United States

                    semester Central Normal and Canterbury College alumni numbered nearly 60,000; many of them were in
                    teaching and administrative positions in public schools throughout the country.6
            
            The prospect of the college's closing was difficult for the community to accept. A strong
                    relationship had existed between the college and the town since the 1870s when a group of Danville
                    citizens subscribed $10,000 to buy the Methodist Academy property in 
                        Danville
                     to build a college. On May 10, 1878, the existing Central Normal College and Commercial
                    Institute situated at Ladoga, Indiana, along with the students, library, and laboratory equipment,
                    was transported the twenty miles to Danville. This beginning provided an established base upon which
                    to build the envisioned college and helped to ensure its success. The relocated institution was
                    continued in 
                        Danville
                     as Central Normal College.7
            
            Under the early leadership of President William F. Harper, who had attended the pioneer National
                    Normal School at 
                  Lebanon, Ohio
               , and with a dedicated faculty the institution claimed to be debt free
                    by 1885.8 Beginning in the 1890s, however, the prosperity of the institution
                    began to lag, and financial difficulties appeared despite the fact that the college had maintained
                    an enrollment exceeding that of Indiana University until 1890.9 Although Central
                    Normal operated under a sole proprietorship arrangement during its first twenty-five years, by the
                    turn of the century it had become clear that it was no longer practical for the school to be
                    privately owned.
            In August, 1900, eighty Danville citizens organized a stock company and assumed control of the
                    college "in appreciation of the cultural worth and financial potential of the institution
                    for the town." This reorganization broadened the financial base of the institution and
                    involved a large segment of the local community in its affairs, helping to develop further a strong
                    town and gown relationship. The new stockholders early declared a nonprofit policy and in 1911 the
                    college was reincorporated as a nonprofit educational corporation

                     with a self-perpetuating board of trustees.10 Under this new arrangement the college continued to grow and prosper and at the time of its
                    golden jubilee in 1926 had enrolled in excess of 40,000 students and allegedly had more of its
                    graduates teaching in the Indiana public schools than any other college in the state.11
            
            Following World War I private normal colleges in the 
                        United States
                     experienced growing competition from the emerging publicly supported teachers colleges.
                    The previous success and prestige of Central Normal, however, helped it to continue then despite the
                    competition and also during the adverse years of the Depression of 1929 and World War II. On several
                    occasions the citizens of Danville made contributions to help keep Central Normal College operating.
                    In addition, special state legislation in 1945 permitted Hendricks County to levy a property tax on
                    behalf of the college for the following year.12 The levy on all real and
                    personal property raised $18,000 to sustain the institution, and county students were
                    permitted to enroll at the normal school without paying tuition during the 1946-1947 academic
                        year.13
            
            By the end of World War II there was a decreasing need for single purpose teacher training
                    institutions, and in 
                        Danville
                     this situation apparently was recognized by the leaders of Central Normal College. In
                    addition, the troublesome financial situation of the postwar years obliged trustees of such schools
                    to consider three institutional options for future operation: go out of existence, become a state
                    college provided the favor of the general public and the legislature could be gained, or attempt to
                    change through a new and more viable purpose. A change in name and in character was the option
                    agreed upon by the trustees as necessary for the continued existence of Central Normal College.14
            
            In the spring of 1946 Central Normal College entertained an offer by a group of cleric and lay
                    Episcopalians in Indiana for church sponsorship of the institution. Negotiations were begun and a
                    resolution effecting this sponsorship was passed by the

                        United States
                    .16 The old Central Normal College trustees stepped down on July 8,
                    1946, and relinquished control to the board of the newly named Canterbury College. The initial
                    authority for Canterbury College to operate as an institution of higher education within the state
                    and to award baccalaureate degrees was granted with the approval of a certificate of amendment to
                    Central Normal College's original articles of incorporation. The certification was
                    registered on August 8, 1946, with the secretary of state and changed the corporate name of the
                    institution to Canterbury College.17 The agreement to release control of the
                    Danville college brought to an end sixty-eight years of continued access to higher education under
                    the aegis of that private normal college. Central Normal College officially ended its academic life
                    after operation under three proprietorships, two incorporations, sixteen presidents, and an
                    enrollment of over 60,000 students.18 The local institution was probably the
                    last nondenominational and exclusively privately controlled normal school to operate in the Midwest
                    and perhaps in the 
                        United States
                     as an 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    News reporter asserted in 1944.19
            
            The newly reconstituted institution opened as Canterbury College, a Christian inspired, coeducational
                    school with a program of liberal arts implanted on the former teacher training program. The campus,
                    physical plant, most of the faculty, and even a majority of the students were part of the
                    institutional transfer. The former trustees of Central Normal College allegedly "explained
                    they were not selling out but they were perpetuating the control of the college in a different
                        character."20 The trustees indicated that they felt "the
                    benefits to Danville of such a college with high standards and a promising future was ultimate in
                    their final decision."21
            
            By the spring of 1948, however, Canterbury College faced financial difficulties of its own. The lay
                    Episcopalian president, Dr. Edgar C. Cumings, first president of Canterbury College, announced his
                    resignation effective at the end of the spring semester; the college

                     board of trustees stated at their April 2 meeting that the
                    Indiana dioceses of the church following several months of investigation and discussion would
                    withdraw their sponsorship after the current academic year.22 The college had
                    operated since April, 1946, with income generated from student tuition, support from church parishes
                    and individual churchmen, and a $50,000 gift from the Canterbury College
                    Founder's Association. In order to meet operating expenses of the college, the trustees
                    estimated that $50,000 annually would be needed in addition to income from student
                    tuition. The college board also estimated that at least one and one half million dollars would be
                    necessary to put the college in an adequate position financially to meet the competition for
                        students.23 In April, 1948, to encourage support for the institution a
                    predominantly Episcopal group created the Laymen's Foundation, and that action prompted
                    church reconsideration of its earlier announced withdrawal of sponsorship Ox Canterbury College.24 With the new foundation's advance of $30,500 Canterbury
                    College continued to operate. However, continuing disagreements between the new Episcopal president,
                    the Reverend Douglas R. Mac-Laury, and the college board over administrative policies and future
                    plans for the institution allegedly led to the subsequent resignation of the president and several
                    of the trustees in late 1950 and early 1951.25 At this time control of the
                    college began to revert back to Danville trustees as Episcopal trustees resigned and were replaced
                    by local businessmen who continued to operate the institution under the name of Canterbury
                        College.26
            
            Toward the close of the fall semester of 1950-1951 the Canterbury trustees decided that the college
                    might not be able to operate until the end of the current academic year because of the growing
                    financial deficit. Some classes were held for about 220 students during the spring semester and, in
                    an attempt to salvage the college beyond the 1950-1951 academic year, interested individuals and
                    college students reportedly appealed for support to Episcopal lay and cleric leaders, businessmen in
                    the state, and philanthropic foundations. Some efforts allegedly were made by unnamed community
                    leaders to have the state of Indiana assume control and establish a junior college or extension
                    center under the auspices of one of the state supported institutions.27 The
                    college's accumulated indebtedness and the history of financial problems, however, proved
                    to be strong liabilities

                     in attracting interest and investments in the struggling
                    Danville institution. The Canterbury College board of trustees, now comprised mostly of local
                    businessmen, nevertheless declined to consider seriously commercial and industrial offers for the
                    college site and buildings.28
            
            Special state legislation in early 1951 had given the Danville Public School Corporation the first
                    option to purchase the college property and assets should it become impossible to continue an
                    institution of higher learning in that town.29 The possibility of using the
                    college facilities appealed to the local community since the high school was overcrowded and the
                    township could not afford an expansion program costing an estimated one half million dollars.30 The college trustees stated that they felt the only way they could carry out
                    the trust under which the college assets were held would be for the institution to revert to the
                    local community since Danville citizens had long contributed to the operation and building fund
                    drives of the original campus of Central Normal College.31
            
            It became increasingly apparent during April, 1951, that only a miracle could save the college from a
                    closing because of lack of funds. There was a consensus among all interested backers, trustees, and
                    townspeople that it would take a considerable contribution of money from one or more new sources to
                    perpetuate the life of the local college. Eleven Danville civic, fraternal, and patriotic
                    organizations, which had banded together as the Allied Civic Club, promoted the slogan of
                    "Give A Buck To Save A College" as a final big drive for a financial revival of
                    the institution. This solicitation was to serve as a springboard for a later national campaign.32
            
            The festivities began with a parade which assembled at 1:30 P. M. that first Saturday in June, 1951,
                    at the Danville Park adjacent to the college campus.33 Included in the parade
                    were bands, convertibles with dignitaries and their escorts, a National Guard unit, a horse drawn
                    surrey, a color guard, and a number of decorated tractors and automobiles. Also found in the

                     band marching along attired in red and blue, and the Danville
                    High School and County Legion bands blaring and booming a marching cadence. The acting president of
                    the college, Frederick G. Neel, wore a suit of red underwear and appeared in a barrel while students
                    trailed dressed in patched clothing and pleading for support of their school. Senator Jenner sat
                    coatless atop an elephant loaned for the occasion by Cole Bros. Circus of Peru, Indiana. Governor
                    Henry F. Schricker drove a team of mules while standing coatless in a light springwagon wearing his
                    famous "white hat." Justice Bobbitt joined in the parade along with
                    representatives of many other institutions of higher learning in Indiana.
            Dignitaries and local residents joined in lending a hand. Lieutenant Governor Crawford Parker, the
                    county sheriff, and local businessmen shined shoes for a dollar. The college trustees, mostly local
                    community leaders, auctioned off their services in a mock "slave market" where
                    each man brought in sums ranging from $15 to $55. Cigarette girls peddled
                    smokes for a dollar a pack; soda pop and donuts also went for a dollar. Seventeen coeds, several of
                    whom were local beauty queens, wore bathing suits covered with play money; they were to peel off a
                    phony dollar in exchange for a real one. The girl who collected the most money was to receive a
                    portable radio. Various business concerns looked for ways to help. The Capital Paper Company of 
                        Indianapolis
                     donated a $429 refrigerator which was auctioned off by Senator Jenner for
                    $350; a twenty-three inch television set was sold also under list price. The Hatfield
                    Paint Company of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , a college creditor, cut its bill in half and its president said he was mailing a small
                    personal check. Neel reported that 250 of the outstanding accounts had been surrendered by creditors
                    in an effort to help the college.34 There was even a type of flagpole sitter. A
                    fraternity president sat on a platform atop a wooden scaffold erected over the entrance to the ivy
                    covered Administration Building. Below his makeshift roost was a sign that said, "I
                    AIN'T COMING DOWN ‘TILL THIS SCHOOL'S OUTA THE RED." A
                    refrigerator had been hoisted up for his food and drink. Even strangers who happened through the
                    small college town during the festivities did their part to help. They contributed dollar bills to
                    students dressed in rags who were working the highways shouting "Give A Buck To Save A
                    College!"
            Those visitors who stopped joined the estimated 3,000 persons that paraded west up 
                        United States
                     Highway 36 past the Danville business houses that were flying flags of purple and grey,
                    the college's colors, to the Hendricks County courthouse. There the crowd stood

                     in the 95° heat as it listened to educational and
                    political leaders seated on the speaker's platform at the southeast corner of the
                    courthouse lawn. Governor Schricker during his turn said that "if $10,000 could
                    be raised for the college back in those days [World War II], then surely ten times that amount can
                    be raised in this day and age." The governor further pointed out that a total of 16,378
                    students were in private and church related colleges in Indiana and that it was vitally important to
                    keep those colleges in operation; should these schools cease, the state supported universities and
                    colleges would not be able to carry that extra educational load. Speaking of the loyalty to the
                    college shown that day, Schricker said, "This loyalty is what makes America strong. The
                    college here has never lost sight of its obligations and we must help now. I don't think
                    the people of Indiana will allow this central Indiana college to die."35
            
            The events of the day concluded that evening in the college gymnasium with the seventy-fifth annual
                    alumni banquet, which included former students from both Central Normal and Canterbury colleges. The
                    "Give A Buck To Save A College" day was declared a success, and members of the
                    local Allied Civic Club believed that a significant start had been made in erasing the debt that
                    threatened to close the college. George Lewis, general chairman of the campaign, said he thought
                    "between $10,000 and $15,000 had been raised at the end of the
                    campaign day."36 A final accounting by the treasurer of the college
                    board of trustees showed that estimate to be somewhat optimistic as funds from all sources totaled
                    less than $8,000 with administrative expenses nearly $500. Later included as
                    part of the nationwide campaign to clear the college debt by August 15 was a door to door
                    solicitation in 
                        Hendricks County
                     and a mailing request to 4,000 friends, contributors, and alumni of the
                        college. Those efforts, along with the "dollar day" program and other
                    smaller drives, eventually reduced the debt against the college to approximately $75,000
                    from the original $90,000.37 The effort was not sufficient; the
                    college closed its doors at the end of the summer of 1951 never to reopen.
            The continued life of a college is a matter in which many people may have a stake as the example of
                    Canterbury College would suggest. Why the enthusiasm and support shown for the college during the
                    special activities on June 3, 1951, along with the evidenced high level of interest and commitment
                    to the college's survival dissipated in the space of several months is an interesting
                    problem. Although

                     little of the evidence is available, the vantage point of time
                    affords some opportunity for objective weighing of existing evidence related to the question.
            With the eclipse of the private normal school as a viable educational institution the continuation of
                    a college in 
                        Danville
                     after 1946 was predicated on the ability of the new board of trustees to infuse a
                    broader purpose into the institution along with a curriculum clearly reflecting the changing
                    direction of education. This was never really achieved although in the early years of Canterbury
                    College a sincere effort apparently was made. The low level of financial commitment to the new
                    college along with a lack of success in developing a broad base of loyal supporters for its expanded
                    goals evidently presented impossible obstacles to overcome. Without this base of support and with a
                    lack of specificity as to the new goals with which the institution was to identify, Canterbury
                    College in 1951 had no alternative but to succumb gradually to the stronger residual purposes of
                    Central Normal College, purposes which five years earlier had been considered outdated. This
                    dependence on earlier goals is reflected in the curriculum of Canterbury College which retained to a
                    large degree the teacher education program of the antecedent institution.38 In
                    fact according to existing records Canterbury College had difficulty differing measurably from the
                    previous educational orientation of Central Normal College.39 This doubtless
                    caused some skepticism as to what end an educational institution in 
                        Danville
                     was to serve, especially when the goal of single purpose teacher education had already
                    proved insufficient as to an educational need.
            Support for the college at the end probably was really directed toward the vestiges of Central Normal
                    College; this might be suggested also by the ease with which control of the college reverted to the
                    local community. In essence two colleges closed in 
                        Danville
                     in 1951, Canterbury College and Central Normal College, the latter for the second time.
                    John Dewey once wrote that ends without means tend to degenerate into sentimentalism.40 Perhaps that last general widespread outpouring of support for the college on June 3,
                    1951, was in reality a sentimental recognition, a sort of eulogy, for an institution which had
                    played such an important role in the life of Danville and Indiana.
            
               
                  38 For example, President MacLaury's 1949 Easter message mailed

                         Diocese indicated "that half of this spring's graduates would be

            In this fourth installment of his Civil War journal Burke completes his account of his approximately
                    thirty-two months as a Confederate soldier and prisoner of war. This final segment of his record
                    covers just over five months; Burke's last eight weeks as a prisoner in Camp Douglas, 
                        Chicago
                    , his exchange trip in March, 1865, to 
                  Richmond, Virginia
               , his
                    subsequent wanderings with his friend Henry White until just after the close of the war, and his
                    return to 
                  Lexington, Kentucky
               , in early June provide the narrative framework.
            Burke has shown in the previously published material that he often has an eye for significant detail
                    and a terse manner of relating incidents that aptly indicates the amusement, distress, anger, or
                    somewhat stoic indifference that he feels. This ability is more often evident in the material
                    related after his release from prison. Reading through this part of the journal one can almost
                    experience Burke's emotions as he nears and finally becomes a part of the South once more.
                    The hardships of the exchange trip are lightly treated; places evoke memories of family and former
                    times; cheering, singing, and reunion with other returning prisoners show clearly the forbearing joy
                    of the soldiers. Burke is curious about the South and explores, making clear his pleasure at the
                    beauties of the southern spring and the benefits of freedom. Typically amusing is his almost naive
                    bravado at putting off the rumored hardships of Libby Prison in 
                        Richmond
                    ; typically southern is his racial attitude evident in his recorded remarks about blacks
                    and black soldiers in particular.
            His record in places is idyllic—picking flowers and settling down in a wild strawberry
                    patch—in places is romantic—his attempt at courtship and his trip on the
                        Mississippi River, for example. Mainly, however, Burke's journal
                    straightforwardly and simply records a poignant picture of how the defeated South appeared to him.
                    Burke returns to the South just before defeat comes; his disbelief at 
                        Richmond
                    's evacuation and his determination to continue the fight in

                                Indianapolis
                            . Dr. Misselhorn owns the existing journal and it is published with his

                            , indicates that Burke after the war was in the monument business in

                            ,

                            , and was married three times. The two children of his first marriage are

                    , the desolation and destruction, the prevalence of Yankee troops, newspaper reports,
                    and the lack of jobs make clear the extent of the defeat suffered. Burke's lament after 
                        White
                    's sister rejects him is "another ‘Lost Cause’
                    on my shoulders," and it is probably representative of the frustrated hopes of many such
                    young men. When his only hope is to return to 
                        Kentucky
                    , Burke finally takes the Oath of Allegiance—the merely formal recognition of
                    an end to his rebellion—in order to get transportation home. His final overwhelming
                    concern, however, seems to be for his Confederate uniform. He ends his journal with two poems
                    typical of the sentimental, heroic spirit of the southern rebellion—hopeless yet gallant.
            It would be incorrect to attribute too much importance to this journal, even though it is somewhat
                    unusual in the mass of Civil War materials. Many Hoosiers will find the 
                        Morgan
                    's Raid portion1 most interesting; there are apparently
                    some new, or previously unpublicized, details about Camp Douglas; perhaps, information about
                    Burke's experiences will provide an occasional insight for some researcher. But Burke
                    himself always returns as the central interest— a young man experiencing unforgettable
                    episodes of his life. Like many other veterans his later life was probably marked by his memories of
                    the war, but Burke had the concrete reminder of his "journal." Near the end of his
                    life he returned to that account and no doubt experienced anew the events he had lived through
                    decades before. The last entry for June 7,1865, ends with obvious summation, but here as elsewhere
                    it is difficult to tell—and not really worth speculating—where
                    Burke's original "journal" merges with reminiscence. Such distinctions
                    are not ultimately important. Burke's account—whether colored by time or
                    not—must stand as a significant contribution to the diverse record of that conflict
                    compiled by statesmen, officers, citizens, and common soldiers from both the North and the South.

                        Sunday January 1st, 1865. New Year's day. Weather a little cool. After roll
                                    call and breakfast the guard put us to preparing for inspection the same as
                                    yesterday, and as soon as we were ready the guard informed us that the inspection
                                    was over. The kitchen only being inspected. I was kept busy all morning and as soon
                                    as dinner was ready I sent 
                                        Henry
                                     to invite Pa and his bunkmate to dinner. Dinner over and all had
                                    plenty. My Bill of Fare was as follows: Boiled Beef, Bean Soup, Soft Bread, Biscuit
                                    shortened, Tea with sugar, Cheese, Chip Beef, Vinegar, pepper, salt. Delicacies.
                                    Prune Pie, Onion Pie, Potatoe Pie, Vinegar pie, Ginger cake, Apples. After dinner I
                                    found we had enough left to snack on for several days, and all without laying out a
                                    cent. I have obtained the name of being quite a cook and the men say that I can make
                                    good pies out of almost anything, but I do not flatter myself quite so much. At dusk
                                    a new prisoner was shot in the mouth for going under his barrack (No. 30) to the
                                    sick men's tub. The detail had failed to set the tub out in the street when
                                    the retiring bugle sounded, and the prisoner not knowing that he was liable to be
                                    shot for going under the barrack after dark. This is a bad beginning for the first
                                    night of a new year.
                        [Burke provides a list of the sutler's prices on January 3: flour,
                                    $20 per barrel; butter, 80c per pound; lard, 60c per pound; cheese, 50c
                                    per pound; smoking tobacco, 60c to $1.50 per pound; chewing tobacco,
                                    $3 per pound; envelopes and paper, 3 for 5c; stamped envelope, 5c; black
                                    tea, $2.50 per pound; coffee, $1 per pound; sugar, 60c per
                                    pound; molasses, 75c per pound; black pepper, 20c per paper; bottle of ink, 25c;
                                    black thread, 20c per skein; crackers, 25c per pound; one ginger cake, 30c; one
                                    apple, 5c; soda, 25c per paper (pp. 390-91). The "point" is a new
                                    punishment that Burke explains on the fifth: prisoners are made to bend
                                    "forward stiff legged with their left arm across their backs and their
                                    right fore finger on the ground" (p. 391). On the sixth guards fire on a
                                        
                              
                                 1 In editing this journal the typescript has been
                                            followed exactly except as here indicated. Dates for the entries in the
                                            typescript are located on the right side of the page and divide the entries;
                                            dates are relocated in the text published here primarily to save space. When
                                            possible without distortion, Burke's lists have been paragraphed
                                            and appropriate punctuation has been added. Reproduced notices, songs, and
                                            documents in the journal have been set here in reduced type. Only a few
                                            obvious typing errors have been corrected; otherwise misspellings have been
                                            allowed to remain. Confusing spellings usually have a suggested alternative
                                            in brackets. Capitalization is unchanged. Burke's use of the
                                            apostrophe in the possessive is quite erratic; the typescript is followed
                                            without change. Obvious repetitions have been omitted. Names and place names
                                            supplied from an outside source are corrected in brackets in the text or
                                            given correctly in notes. Where text has been omitted in the journal
                                            published here, significant events are briefly summarized within brackets.
                                            These summaries include only events which Burke's journal relates.
                                            Page numbers from the typescript are indicated in parentheses when the
                                            journal is quoted in the summaries. A row of spaced periods indicates that
                                            entries have been omitted and that summaries have been judged unnecessary.
                                            The consistent dating readily indicates the total time lapse of both
                                            summaries and omissions. Notes are entirely omitted for various names and
                                            events which could not be adequately identified.
                           
                                     prisoner who enters a forbidden area to recover
                                    clothes blown from his window at the convalescent ward; the shots missed him but
                                    wounded in the legs two men inside the convalescent ward.2 Burke
                                    mentions on January 7 that letters from home are urging the men to go out on the
                                    oath of allegiance because exchange is hopeless. By the eighth Burke indicates that
                                    they have almost given up hope of extra rations promised by Confederate General
                                    William N. R. Beall in December." On the tenth "Some of the
                                    know-nothing copperheads that arrived a few days ago from everywhere came to our
                                    barrack. They professed that they were citizens of the U. S. and did not know what
                                    they were imprisoned for" (p. 392). Several men get merry on Plantation
                                    Bitters bought illegally from the sutler on January 12. ∗ Also Burke indicates on this day that "Prisoners are
                                    going out on the Oath pretty lively in the last few days"
                                    (p. 393). There are further punishments devised; one very simply is standing in line
                                    on one foot outside in the cold. On the eighteenth Burke records that "A
                                    new mule has been made for the prisoners benefit. It is about fifteen feet high and
                                    twelve feet long. It looks like a big trestle, and is about two inches wide on top,
                                    rather too sharp to ride comfortably, besides there is no sturrup and the legs are
                                    allowed to swing clear and free" (p. 395).]
                        Tuesday January 24th, 1865. Weather cold. It is my 23d birthday. I and 
                                        Henry
                                     and our nearest neighbors (Jo. R. Jenkins and Aom. T. Boulware) joined
                                    funds for a big dumpling dinner. I made the dumplings, etc. I put a lb. of butter
                                    and a lb. of sugar and some spice in our sauce. Our Bill of Fare was as follows:
                                    Boiled Beef, Bean Soup, Soft Bread, Salt, pepper, vinegar. Delicacies, Dumplings
                                    with sauce, Ginger cake [with sauce], Vinegar Pie, Apples. We invited one of the
                                    cooks. Out of 31 large apple dumplings I and

                                            this incident is in The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of

                                            hereafter as Official Records. In the report the date of
                                            the incident is January 7 at 9 A. M. Only one guard was investigated and
                                            cleared of negligence in the matter.
                              
                                 3 Beall had been paroled by the Federal government to
                                            handle supplies for Confederate prisoners of war. During January, 1865, he
                                            was plagued with rearrest by the Federals, general misunderstandings about
                                            his duties, and difficulties with the shipment of southern cotton which was
                                            to pay for the supplies. By February 6 Beall reported that a shipment of
                                            supplies was off to the prison at 
                                                Elmira
                                            , 
                                                New York
                                            , even though procedural problems continued. The cotton was
                                            finally received and sold, and supplies were sent to prisoners at various
                                            stations. See for example ibid., Vol. VII, 13-15, 21-22,

                                            Confederate prisoners of war reporting on his mission and giving a chart of

                                            purposes was the bottle of bitters, concocted according to various favorite
                                            recipes from dewberry, crane's-bill, wild cherry, yellow poplar, or
                                            sarsaparilla—stewed, crushed, distilled, and combined with witch
                                            hazel leaves, cider, whiskey, or brandy, and sumac or bitter roots.

                                            from the doctor for the bitters but improved their opportunity with
                                            "about a dozen bottles" of the contraband substance.
                                            "Plantation Bitters" probably is a brand.
                           
                                     heavy exchange rumors again. We paid our spare
                                    bread for washing. There are a great many who wash cloths for something to eat.
                        [Burke records two more forms of punishment: roll call outside in freezing weather
                                    and acting circus on the barrack's rafters "to the amusement of
                                    the guards and prisoners" (p. 397). "We are pleased to see an
                                    announcement in the papers that a general exchange will commence about the 1st of
                                    February" comments Burke on January 26 (p. 397).5]
                        Friday January 27th, 1865. Weather cold. It was announced that letters for money,
                                    clothing etc. would be approved at the express office today by Lt. Fife. A string of
                                    300 or more soon formed at the express office and stood shivering in the cold
                                    waiting for their turns to go in. I took our frozen beef and bread and with the aid
                                    of a few onions and potatoes made a big mess of hash. We had to cook it on the sly
                                    on the coal stoves as we would be severely punished if the guards caught us. I put 
                                        Henry
                                     on picket while I did the cooking. The prisoners are still going out on
                                    the oath pretty lively. The boys in our barrack cry out "Another states
                                    gone out", every time they see a fellow going out on the oath or
                                    "the dog" as some of them call it. We sang Yankee Doodle.
                        Sunday January 29th, 1865. Weather pleasant. Inspection in the house consisting of a
                                    thoro cleaning of bunks and about five minutes attention in line in the center of
                                    the floor. Six guns were fired near sunset and about 40 or 50 citizens in line
                                    marched in the prison square to examine the quarters. They did not stay long as they
                                    were hurled out by the guards for fear they would converse too freely with the
                                    prisoners. About midnight two patrol guards came in our barrack and caught one of
                                    the men sitting by one of the stoves smoking, and made him climb up on one of the
                                    rafters and act circus. He was sitting astradle of the rafter to blow. After
                                    performing numerous feats, when I gave Henry a punch in the short ribs to wake him

                                 5 The prime movers in effecting this general exchange
                                            of prisoners apparently were General Ulysses S. Grant and Robert Ould,
                                            Confederate agent of exchange. After many delays and mechanical problems of
                                            transportation and delivery, paroled prisoners in significant numbers
                                            actually began arriving at their own lines in early February. Grant expected
                                            mutual delivery of about 3,000 prisoners per week on each side. See Official Records, Ser. II, Vol. VIII, 170, passim. A man who took the oath of allegiance was usually freed
                                            and allowed to return to live in territory within the Federal lines. In a
                                            parole a man gave his word that he would not fight until exchanged. A man
                                            who was exchanged was free to fight again. Direct exchange sometimes took
                                            place in the field between commanding officers. In a general exchange
                                            between the two governments prisoners were paroled and delivered to the
                                            enemy's lines at specified points; a declaration of exchange was
                                            eventually made covering all men in a certain period of time, which was dependent on the number of prisoners delivered.
                              
                           
                                     see the performance. I pointed to the actor and
                                    whispered to him to look and keep quiet. He looked rubbed his eyes and looked again
                                    and said "That is nothing but some body's old cloths hanging
                                    there". But he soon discovered his mistake as the guard ordered the
                                    performance to go on. Just then someone woke up and not knowing that a guard was in
                                    the house spit on the floor. The guard immediately ordered him out of his bunk and
                                    made him take the place of the man on the rafter who was glad enough to get off. The
                                    second actor performed about half an hour and was dismissed. Soon after all had
                                    quieted down a prisoner in the barrack by the name of Wm. Berry, an Alabamian was
                                    caught stealing bread from the kitchen which caused a little disturbance.
                        Monday January 30th, 1865. Weather pleasant. I received a letter from Uncle H. S.
                                    Bishop of 
                                        Cleveland
                                        Ohio
                                    . The men in the barrack after consulting over the bread robbery case
                                    turned Berry over into the hands of the cooks, who decided to strap him. A barrel
                                    was brought in and put in the center of the floor and Berry was laid across the
                                    barrel with his pants down. Bolin Roberts took the strap and struck him 22 times
                                    making him beg considerably. He was then dismissed and walked to his bunk and went
                                    to bed looking very sullen. Just before the retiring bugle blew I got so very hungry
                                    that I had to bum something to eat from my friends, as we were out of provisions and
                                    money. A lively set of guards visited us at night.
                        Tuesday January 31st, 1865. Weather pleasant. There is still a little ice and snow on
                                    the ground. It appears that the patrole guards that were on duty last night were
                                    drinking rather too freely and treated a good many prisoners badly. They went the
                                    grand round. Commencing at barrack No. 1, but did not find any pretext to punish
                                    anyone till they came to barrack No. 5 where some persons was talking, and the men
                                    in the whole barrack (some 200) were rousted out of their bunks and formed in a line
                                    in front of their barrack for an hour standing on one foot, and several guards
                                    walking in the rear of the line to give any person a rap across the shoulders that
                                    was unlucky enough to be caught with his foot down. Several men in the same barrack
                                    were caught sitting at the stove. They were made to put their feet in the second
                                    bunk and their hands on the floor, and in this position they were whipped with belts
                                    by the guards just as a negro would be whipped or worse. Nos. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15,
                                    18, 19, were very roughly handled. All of the men in one whole barrack was made to
                                    stand out awhile and then bare themselves and sit on the snow and ice till they
                                    melted through to the ground. There were 10 or 12 men

                                     whipped altogether in the same manner as those
                                    in No. 5. At last the guards came across a big double fisted reb who refused to be
                                    whipped, and said he would die defending himself. They shook their pistols in his
                                    face and told him that he was too willing to die, then left him and their sport
                                    ceased. A committee for the prisoners informed the authorities of the conduct of the
                                    guards, but no satisfactory response was returned, which occasioned considerable
                                    excitement among the prisoners. Some were for charging the camp. About 40 or 50 men
                                    took the oath and went out, preferring to take the oath rather than submit any
                                    longer to the brutal treatment they as prisoners of war were compelled to
                                        undergo.6 There has been seven men shot for various trivial
                                    offences this month.

                                    stealing on February 1.]
                        Thursday February 2d, 1865. Weather muddy and rainy. The prisoners are still leaving
                                    on the oath. There is a rumor in camp that Davis & Co. were coming to
                                    Fortress Monroe to meet Lincoln & Co. on a peace mission. The papers are
                                    smuggled into the barrack nearly every day and taken to James McDavitt in my barrack
                                    (No. 27) who is a clear reader to read to the crowd, after placing pickets out to
                                    watch for the patrol guards, and when one comes too near the alarm is given and the
                                    paper immediately disappears and the crowd disperses till the picket says
                                    "All's right". We have almost ceased to pay any attention
                                    to the many exchange rumors and peace propositions, as they have so often proven of
                                    no benefit to us. The committee of four in behalf of the prisoners, went out to 
                                        Chicago
                                     on parole to 
                              
                                 6 Official monthly returns for Camp Douglas indicate
                                            numbers of released prisoners as follows: November, 1864, 10; December, 50;
                                            January, 1865, 162; February, 230; March, 217. How many went out on the oath
                                            of allegiance cannot be determined. In February Colonel Benjamin J. Sweet,
                                            commander of Douglas, is told that prisoners who decline the exchange and
                                            offer to take the oath are not to be released until a specified time in the
                                            future. Sweet complains that many more would take the oath if they could be
                                            assured of release. Apparently the time for release was not until May 8 when
                                            General Orders, No. 85, ordered that prisoners could take the oath, be
                                            released, and receive transportation to their homes. Ibid., Vol. VIII, 999-1000; Vol. VII, 210, 219, 220, 538. This
                                            question of release on the oath is complicated by a lack of explanatory
                                            documents. President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed the oath of allegiance and
                                            amnesty on December 8, 1863. Because of abuses and questions he declared a
                                            second amnesty proclamation on March 26, 1864, in which prisoners of war
                                            were specifically excluded from amnesty except on special application. Ibid., Vol. VI, 680-82, 1113-14. After March, 1864, there
                                            still seemed to be confusion according to items in the Official
                                                Records, and Burke certainly has indicated that men have been going
                                            out on the oath. The harsh treatment that Burke refers to was indicated and
                                            condemned as general practice in northern camps in a report by the 
                                                United States
                                             Sanitary Commission, March 3, 1865, which investigated prisoner

                                    a few days, socks, drawers and blankets.7
                        
                        [There is much activity about a prisoner exchange. Missourians are asked on February
                                    6 to refute the exchange and go out on the oath. That night men from 
                                        Kentucky
                                     are asked also, "and not a man said no to
                                    the exchange question" (p. 402). The next day 
                                        Tennessee
                                     men are asked to choose oath or exchange, and 
                                        Missouri
                                     men are signing paroles. "The Yanks are flying around through
                                    camp with rolls, and it really looks as if an exchange was about to take place at
                                    last" (p. 402). On February 8 Burke indicates that the Yankees are
                                    "Still tempting" them with the oath. He reports with pride the
                                    names of only five 
                                        Kentucky
                                     men that ask for the oath while 109 express the desire to be
                                    exchanged.]
                        Thursday February 9th, 1865. Weather cool. We received a new order in relation to the
                                    spit boxes, as follows: Any person caught spitting on the floor or the outside of
                                    any of the boxes had to take the box and wash it out, and if it got full before he
                                    (the prisoner) caught anyone else spitting on the floor he had to wash it out again,
                                    but if he caught any person that person had to clean and take charge of it till he
                                    could catch some one else. The guard always put the first men to watch in the
                                    morning at roll call. Four men were put on, one to each box. The men that are able
                                    and willing to go on exchange at the hospitals are being paroled today. It is
                                    rumored that the prisoners will leave in squads of 500 and the first 500 leaves
                                    tomorrow. There has been but little shooting lately.
                        Friday February 10th, 1865. Weather pleasant. Pa came in from the hospital to see me
                                    but the guard would not let him stay five minutes. Pa gave me an old letter but the
                                    guard had to read it first. The reb workmen are building a large frame chapel in the
                                    Federal square. There was no prisoners sent off today as rumored there would be.
                        Saturday February 11th, 1865. Weather pleasant. A new order was issued that no crowd
                                    will be allowed in the streets larger than five. The guards try to prevent the men
                                    from visiting their friends in other barracks as much as possible, and men are often
                                    punished for being out of their own barrack. About forty or fifty went out on the
                                        Oath. Some of the men are beginning to loose faith in the
                                    exchange altho the papers say that it is a general exchange. The boys are singing
                                    Tramp, Tramp, Tramp, The Boys are Marching.
                        
                           
                              7 On February 15 Beall reports that supplies had been
                                        forwarded to Douglas and other prison camps. Ibid.,
                                    228.
                        
                        
                        The men have been busy for three or four days making haversacks for the exchange
                                    trip. The night became very cold and windy.
                        Monday February 13th, 1865. Weather pleasant. Nearly all of the Missourians and the
                                    2d Ky. about 500 were called in line with their baggage. Their names were called and
                                    counted, and they were marched into some barracks vacated for the purpose, and
                                    searched for overcoats, blankets, etc. Eight of the kitchens were pressed to cook
                                    beef for them, and boiled beef and army crackers were issued to them for five days,
                                    in which time they were expected to be in the confederate lines. They marched out
                                        rejoicing.8 A lot of Confederate clothing arrived in camp
                                    and was held by the prisoners committee for distribution. I took my oil-cloth and
                                    made a carpet bag and haversack, preparatory to an exchange trip.
                        [On February 14 the Yankees are calling the names of 
                                        Kentucky
                                     men who will be paroled; Burke's name is not called.]
                        Friday February 17th, 1865. Weather pleasant, overhead and sloppy underfoot. After
                                    roll call we were all called to the express office and in a few minutes part of us
                                    were sent back to our quarters and a few of the balance were paroled. Just before
                                    dinner the whole camp was called out in line and all of the men that wanted to take
                                    the oath were requested to step to the front. Still tempting us. Fourteen men
                                    stepped out from our line representing five states. They took their baggage and were
                                    moved over to the oath barracks in another part of camp, by themselves. They came
                                    back for their dinners but the boys thinking they were gone for good, had eaten all
                                    of their dinner up. About 1400 prisoners in all want the oath instead of going on
                                    exchange. Prisoners are signing paroles pretty lively today.
                        Monday February 20th, 1865. Weather pleasant. There is a considerable stir in camp.
                                    Another squad of 500 started on exchange after going through the same that the other
                                    squad did. They were a fine looking set of men. I bought 50cts. worth of note paper
                                    for my journal as I expected paper might be scarce in Dixie.
                        
                           
                              8 Official monthly returns from Camp Douglas indicate that
                                        1,500 prisoners were sent for exchange in February and 1,492, in March. At the
                                        end of March there were still 7,165 prisoners at Douglas. Ibid., 1000-1001.
                        
                        
                        Thursday February 23d, 1865. Weather pleasant. The Kentuckians that had not signed
                                    the paroles were all called to the express office after roll call. My name was
                                    called at last and I signed my name in three places as quick as possible. Henry
                                    White received $20 from his sister and friends and we commenced living
                                    well again. The Yanks raised thunder after dark, mistreating the prisoners. I
                                    suppose they got their whiskey in town yesterday and are spreeing on it tonight.

                                    laying in provisions from the sutler for their expected exchange trips.]
                        Sunday February 26th, 1865. Weather cool. There was no inspection. I spent most of
                                    the day writing. The men are all ready with their haversacks, etc. for the journey.
                                    The tailors, shoemakers, ring-makers, toothpick makers, and washmen still do a very
                                    good business. Chas. Byranes [Byrnes] had to ride the Mule awhile
                                    for talking after the retiring bugle sounded.
                        Monday February, 27th, 1865. Weather cool. At roll call we were ordered to get ready
                                    for exchange as soon as we got breakfast. After a hearty breakfast we packed our
                                    carpetbags and haversacks. Most everyone took a fine quilt or comfort for bedding on
                                    the trip. Some took private blankets, but blankets were not much used as they were
                                    generally taken from the prisoners in the search. I took a quilt and one of my blue
                                    blankets thinking that if I could pass with the blanket it would be very useful to
                                    us. I stopped at the sutler's and took up the balance of an order on the
                                    sutler. Our names were then called and we were put in line and as fast as a hundred
                                    men were called they were marched under guard into empty barracks where we staid
                                    till dinner when we were called out to be searched and receive rations. Before
                                    falling out, however, I was so convinced that my blanket would be taken that I left
                                    it in the barrack rather than give them a chance to take it from me. Some of the
                                    boys cut their blankets up and made overshoes out of them. We came out in line in
                                    the same order that we went in, that is a hundred at a time. The order was given
                                    "Rear rank open order, march! halt! front rank about face! prepare for
                                    inspection of baggage!" Then all carpetsacks and haversacks were opened and
                                    blankets, etc. unrolled. Then the examiners came along up the line taking all
                                    overcoats, blankets and extra clothing except a change of underclothing.9 Then some Kroutmen came around with 
                              
                                 9 Among Federal leaders there was great agitation that
                                            Beall's supplies to prisoners were serving the ultimate purpose of
                                            fielding well equipped Confederate 
                           
                                     army crackers and boiled beef neck and
                                    shinbones. Hiram Arnett remarked to some of the boys that refused to take any meat
                                    that they had better draw their dog. One of the guards over heard
                                    the remark and raised a terrible fuss over it, but could not tell exactly who made
                                    the remark. We drew about thirty crackers and a piece of meat about the size of my
                                    double fist. We were then ordered to an "Attention, front rank about face!
                                    rear rank close order march! squad right face! file right march!" and into
                                    the barracks again we went. Some of the men got permission to return with a guard to
                                    their old quarters to get articles left behind in the excitement of preparation. We
                                    managed to raise enough fire in the stoves to boil our coffee for supper. Henry
                                    White's name or the name he was answering to (James McConnell) came so low
                                    on the roll that he was put in with the squad in the next barrack from where I was.
                                    We remained in the barracks under guard all night, making the best we could of our
                                    short allowance of bed clothing, but the boys talked as much as they pleased after
                                    the retiring bugle blew. They were ordered several times to keep less fuss, but it
                                    did no good. The principal subject for discussion was, "Why we did not
                                    leave this evening"? The guard could not inform us. Some snow fell during
                                    the night.
                        [On February 28 Burke's group returns to quarters apparently because of lack
                                    of transportation.]
                        Thursday March 2d, 1865. Weather pleasant. At roll call we were again agreeably
                                    surprised by being ordered to prepare for exchange. We were soon ready. Most of the
                                    boys flourishing empty haversacks or "war bags" as a lady in 
                                        Tennessee
                                     called them. Our names were called and we were marched back into the
                                    empty barracks as before. About 11 o'clock a.m. we were ordered in line and
                                    researched again. This time there were three Yanks came up each line. The first had
                                    slips of paper and a pencil. He took each man's blanket, cumfort or quilt
                                    and put his name, company, and regiment on one of the slips and handed it to the
                                    second Yank, who had a paper of pins to pin the slips on, and handed the blankets,
                                    etc. to the third Yank, who when he got an armful threw them in a pile. Some person
                                    had curiosity enough to ask what it was done for, and were told that we would be too
                                    crowded in the cars with them, but that they would be put in a separate car and we
                                    would get them again, but notwithstanding these 
                              troops after the exchange. Grant expected that supplies would go to
                                            prisoners not exchanged but indicated that blankets could be taken away from
                                            any men exchanged if necessary. William Hoffman, Federal commissary general
                                            of prisoners, indicated that blankets should not be taken. Ibid., 227, 257, 289. No authority for this stripping of prisoners
                                            has been located.
                           
                            fair promises most of us were satisfied
                                    that we would never see them again. Yet we could see no reason or excuse for the
                                    outrage. Some of the boys comically ordered their blankets, etc. checked to the
                                    Spotts-wood, American and other 
                                        Richmond
                                     Hotels.10 While in line I saw a patrol guard have
                                    about twenty men in line standing on one foot. One of them got out of balance and
                                    dropped his foot, and the guard collared and jerked him out of line then kicked,
                                    struck and slapped him for a few minutes and shoved him back into line again with an
                                    oath and told him to see if he could'nt hold his foot up. I heard a
                                    whispered vengeance on all sides from the boys. We were then marched back to the
                                    barracks where we remained till 2 o'clock p. M. Then we were marched out
                                    again and drew some soft bread and boiled beef. Jos. and Alfred Stanhope of Co. A
                                    tried to smuggle themselves into our squad but the guards detected them and they
                                    were sentenced to wear a barrel till the last squad left. Pa got permission to bid
                                    me good-bye, and we were marched into the Federal square where we waited for the
                                    regiment that was to guard us on the trip. They came at last, a rough looking crew.

                                    deserters from Price's army11 and elsewhere. As we
                                    marched out of the gate into the open country the boys had to give vent to their
                                    feeling, by giving three ringing cheers, singing Dixie.
                        We had a muddy walk to the railroad near half a mile, where there was a train of
                                    third class cars. I and 
                                        Henry
                                     got together in the car next to the locomotive. We did not get to see
                                    much of the City altho I would have liked very much to have passed through it as we
                                    were in sight of it so long. The cars made very good time. After dusk the guards
                                    were very strict and would not let us look out. About ten o'clock 
                                        Henry
                                     complained of being very sleepy and put his carpet bag on the floor and
                                    sat on it with his head in my lap. I did not feel very sleepy. We had just left a
                                    station and had not regained a full headway when all at once there was a sudden jar
                                    and the end of the car was stove in giving us a complete ducking from the tender. A

                                     many were thrown from their seats breaking the
                                    backs and inflicting sundry bruises and scratches. One of the guards at the door
                                    next to the tender was bruised severely and grunted around for awhile. I was held so
                                    firmly in my seat that my hat was the only thing that moved out of its place. We
                                    soon learned that we had come in collision with a passenger express train that was
                                    behind time. Their locomotive and baggage car was thrown entirely off of the track
                                    and mashed up badly. Their engineer was killed instantly and several others severely
                                    wounded. We had no serious hurts on our train. Our locomotive remained on the track,
                                    but was very much damaged. As we were going slow and had the heaviest train we were
                                    not shocked as much as those on the other train. It is just 72 miles from 
                                        Chicago
                                    . Our engineer saw the other train coming and reversed the engine and
                                    jumped out waving his lamp, but they were too close together. In about two hours we
                                    were taken back to the next switch by another locomotive where we remained all
                                    night. The water was standing all over the floor which soon became mud.
                        Friday March 3d, 1865. Weather pleasant. A fresh locomotive and baggage car came up
                                    and the train except our car was attached to it. We were moved into the other
                                    baggage car, which had no seats or other accomodations. We got the corporal of the
                                    guard to buy us sausage, cheese, crackers, etc. at some of the stations where the
                                    train stopped long enough by paying or giving him permission to buy himself a plug
                                    of tobacco. Several of the guards in the other cars collected a lot of money from
                                    the prisoners in their car to buy whiskey, provisions, etc. and kept it.
                        Saturday March 4th, 1865. Weather cloudy. We passed through Indiana in a hurry
                                    stopping at 
                                        Ft. Wayne
                                     and other places. We passed Massil[l]on,

                                    , my birthplace before I knew it and soon reached Canton where Uncle Wm.
                                    Burke lives, but it was drizzling rain so that there was but few around the depot.
                                    With the guard's permission I inquired of a little boy about my friends. He
                                    knew them, so I took a 
                                        South Carolina
                                     Staff button and wrapped it up in a slip of paper with my compliments
                                    and threw it to him requesting him to take it to the house, which he promised to do.
                                    The train did not stop long. Our course through

                                     bought a couple of pounds of sugar from one of the guards at 20 cents
                                    per lb. We had a good chance to buy apples and improved it. The apple boys would
                                    sell out large baskets full in a few minutes. We then started down the bank of the

                                    ball or party, and some boys rocked the cars coming pretty near. Some of the guards,
                                    who came near fireing into them, but the cars were moving too fast. We arrived

                                    since we started, but there was no place to lie down. The ground was too muddy. It
                                    was about nine o'clock when a train of box cars backed up and we crowded
                                    in. They were very dirty, so much as that we could not find suitable places to sit
                                    down, but we were all so sleepy that it did not make much difference to us where we
                                    slept. The train did not leave till morning.
                        Monday March 6th, 1865. Weather pleasant. We moved off at daylight. We stopped at 
                                        Cumberland City
                                    ,

                                     just before dark. The guards drew some rations for themselves and
                                    bought things for the men. There was some talk of issueing rations to the prisoners
                                    as their rations were out also, but it was not done. We left Cumberland after dark
                                    and traveled all night reaching Martinsburg [West] 
                                        Virginia
                                     about day light. 18 miles from Harpers Ferry.
                        Tuesday March 7th, 1865. Weather pleasant. We left Martinsburg and passed through
                                    Harpers Ferry. The train stopped on the

                                     side of the Potomac for an hour. The country and the people seemed very
                                    much changed since I passed through this country in 1863, on my first exchange
                                        trip.13 We arrived at

                                            commander of the Army of the Cumberland, on January 11, 1863, because of a
                                            misunderstanding about flag of truce procedures. They were imprisoned at 
                                                Nashville

                                     sundown. The cars stopped in the suburbs and we
                                    were kept in the cars. I could not get to talk with any person. I had relatives in
                                    the city and would liked to have seen them or slipped off and went to their house. I
                                    tried to give the guards the slip intending to report at Fort McHenry in the morning
                                    if successful, but we were too closely watched. Some persons outside had a lot of
                                    bread, cheese, crackers, etc. distributed among the prisoners. An hour after dark we
                                    fell in line and marched three miles to Ft. McHenry. We were marched into the first
                                    enclosure of the Ft. and an officer came up and said all of the quarters were full,
                                    there being a squad there ahead of us from Camp Chase for exchange. Then we were all
                                    crowded into as small a place as possible and told to make the best of it till
                                    morning. The ground was muddy and the breeze from the bay was very chilly.14 The supernumerary guards took the boys in turns after water,
                                    etc. The guards helped them to hook some wood from the Federal quarters and we
                                    succeeded in raising enough fire to make plenty of coffee. I had a gallon tin bucket
                                    we used for that purpose. The guard line was so close that we did not have much room
                                    to stir in, but the men moved around in a circle like a herd of cattle to keep warm.
                                    The fires were not sufficient. I walked around most all night, stopping once in a
                                    while to rest and doze sitting on my bucket, but when I was about to roll off in the
                                    mud, I would go to walking again.

                        Friday March 10th, 1865. Weather cool. Pontoon bridge was opened and we passed

                                    came to Akins Landing where we anchored within stone throw of a large steamer with a

                                    's command. Men were enquiring for their officers and officers
                                    for their men, and who died in prison or took the oath and who did' nt. So for an hour we yelled at each other till
                                    they and we had to go ashore. Our guards became even more speculative as we were
                                    about to leave them than they had been on the trip, offering to buy rings,
                                    toothpicks, breast pins, and other trinkets and to sell blankets, canteens,
                                    haversacks, knives, etc. for greenbacks. They did not seem to like the idea of being
                                    so close to our lines, and were very much afraid that they would be ordered to
                                    escort us to our lines, where they might be recognised. There was a few very clever fellows among them, but the majority of them were hard cases.
                                    We were counted off as we marched to land with the other squad who had reached the
                                    top of the bank ahead of us near a planter's house, then occupied as army
                                    quarters. I noticed here as at City Point and other places the country was covered
                                    with small new plank quarters or houses, interspersed here and there with tents.
                                    Large quantities of supplies were visible both in boats and in store houses. A squad
                                    of cavalry with the worst looking set of horses I ever saw any cavalry use, took
                                    charge of us, the two squads of prisoners numbering about fifteen hundred men. We
                                    were informed that we would have to walk three miles before we got out of the
                                    Federal lines, where our boats would take us for 
                                        Richmond
                                    . We started off, the men expressing themselves willing to walk. The
                                    ground was muddy making walking very disagreeable, as the sticky clay so peculiar to
                                    this part of the state accumulate to such a weight on our feet as to impede our
                                    progress very much. Our feet looking like patent mud workers for brick yards, but
                                    for all this we were so eager to get within our lines once more that we kept the
                                    horses half of the time in a trot. Up to the time we landed I had not noticed any
                                    negro troops, but after we left Akins landing I saw nothing else. All of the forts
                                    and earthworks were manned by them. They flocked out to see us as we passed, and I
                                    never saw a blacker set of negroes in my life. They beat the "Ace of
                                    Spades". I noticed wherever there was a yellow man he was a sergeant or
                                        corporal.17 We all halted at the picket line two miles and a
                                    half from Akins Landing, to wait for the officer in charge to come up with the Flag
                                    of Truce so that rebel pickets would not fire on us as we advanced. I was very
                                    thirsty and pulled off one of my gloves to get a drink from a gully near by before
                                    the men muddied it up, loosing one of my gloves in the operation. We were then
                                    within a few yards of the picket base where some fifteen

                                    white man (their officer) sat around a small fire on some logs. In a few minutes the
                                    officer stepped out and called the names of the next relief. One of the darkies
                                    became very mad, and buried his bayonet in the ground up to the muzzle of his gun
                                    swearing that it was'nt his turn to go and he would not go, and I noticed
                                    that he did not go. We could see a good many earth works on the
                                    south side of the James that the guards said were Confederate works. After waiting
                                    an hour the officer with the flag came and we moved on half a mile beyond the

                                        Richmond
                                    ) at being from under guard once more. Some of the retiring guards did
                                    not like it and one of them remarked that we had better hollow while we were able
                                    for after we lived on corn cob meal and water awhile we would not hollow much. Col.
                                    Hatch of C S. A. our commissioner for exchange18 came up in a
                                    buggy and was received with immense cheers. Then we sang Just Before the Battle
                                    Mother.
                        As soon as he could quiet the men he made us a short speech, welcoming us back as a
                                    band of tried and faithful adherents to the Southern Cause, who had refused to take
                                    the Yankee oath, and was sorry to inform us that the river was so high that he could
                                    not bring the boats to us, that we would have to walk three miles up the river.
                                    (Cheers and cries of all right, and sang Jine the Cavalry.
                        And as soon as we were on board he would issue us rations, the same that
                                    Lee's army have been receiving for the last twelve months. Then the men
                                    moved forward again at a brisk walk cheering as they went. We soon reached our
                                    pickets, the Federal officer turning back. The pickets had small works to shelter
                                    themselves, ditches with logs or rocks on top of the earthworks. Then came the
                                    regular earthworks protected by Averdefree Shiver def rees torpedoes19 and a ditch as far as I could see on either side. The torpedoes were
                                    under ground very close together in a line between the Averdefrees and the
                                    Shiverdefrees each having an upright stake which had apiece of red flannel on it.

                                     Some of the men remarked that the red flannel
                                    was to draw on the negroes. The Johny Rebs were very glad to see us and had a good
                                    many questions to ask, but we did not stop as we had still a long muddy tramp before
                                    us. We passed a good many formidable earthworks. We were out of sight of the river
                                    and I saw a portion of the crowd cutting across the country and learning that they
                                    were going to see Fort Darling (Drurry's Bluff)20 I
                                    joined them, but we all struck the river too high up and as we did not have any time
                                    to lose we did not turn down to see it. We were traveling through very rough
                                    country, fortified and partly cleared. The gullies and branches were full from the
                                    recent rains giving us some trouble in fording them. In some places the undergrowth
                                    was pretty thick, the timber having all been cut away. We passed several places
                                    where darkies were building log houses for 1866 winter quarters. They were one story
                                    about 12 ft. square, rock chimneys, and built in rows making streets. I asked one of
                                    the blacks how he would like to shoot at a Yankee negro, and he replied that he
                                    would like it very well if the Yankee nigger did not have any gun, as he would
                                    rather live with the rebels than the Yankees. The crowd became separated and
                                    scattered all over the country for a mile, all making for the bridge across the
                                        James River, where our boats were reported to be. Soon the
                                    smoke stacks came in sight and we livened up a little. Altho I had walked very fast
                                    I found a good many on the bridge ahead of me. There was one large and one small
                                    transport awaiting us. The bridge had been partly taken away in some way, and the
                                    deficiency supplied by pontoons that swing back to allow boats to pass. The men came
                                    straggling in from different directions, but no one was allowed on board till nearly
                                    all had arrived, then we were counted onto the boats each man receiving a piece of
                                    corn bread and bacon as he stepped aboard. I got aboard of the large boat which
                                    started first, raising the new Confederate flag amid the cheers of the men. We
                                    passed through the bridge and up the river. The other boat soon followed. Our corn
                                    bread and boiled bacon I thought much sweeter than the hard crackers and raw bacon
                                    that we had been drawing. A black man came around with a basket of fine apples
                                    selling them at five dollars apiece (in Confed money) like hot cakes. We had a
                                    pleasant trip and fine scenery. I saw a large spoile driving machine and some small
                                    boats. In an hour and a half we came in sight of the Capitol and the Timborazo

                                     and soon after landed at the wharf at upper
                                    part of the city where a large crowd cheered us as we landed. We were requested to
                                    go to camp Lee where we would be provided for, but most of us thinking that we could
                                    do better for ourselves, left the crowd and struck out up in the City to see what we
                                    could see. I got separated from Henry White (my partner) and knocked about the
                                    streets like a country greener. I fell in with some of our boys about dark and went
                                    to a private boarding house kept by a Mr. Saddler where there was a lot more of my
                                    regiment. I secured a cot on the floor for the night at five dollars, and took a
                                    walk in the city. I found it to be quite a large city. Stores were all close on
                                    account of its being Confederate thanksgiving day. I heard some ladies sing the
                                    Picket Guard.22
                        
                        I soon left the crowded streets and returned to my boarding house. Several of the
                                    boys had ordered supper at fifteen dollars each, but most of us fell back on our
                                    rations for supper. I soon retired, but did not rest well as there was three in the
                                    bed.
                        Saturday March 11th, 1865. Weather pleasant. I saw a crowd of 
                                        Morgan
                                    's men going to Camp Lee to draw rations. I was not in need of
                                    rations but concluded to go with them hoping to come across my partner. I had not
                                    seen him since I lost him on landing. About one mile and a half to the westward of
                                    the city brought us to the camp, where there was already a great many of our and
                                    other returned prisoners assembled. Camp Lee is on a rather level piece of ground
                                    with a long building for soldiers and a good many out houses scattered around,
                                    officers quarters, commissary depots, etc. I joined the crowd at the registering
                                    office and after a good deal of crowding I registered my name to draw rations as I
                                    seldom miss the chance getting out of that crowd. I joined the crowd at the
                                    Commissary's where after waiting for nearly two hours my turn came for
                                    rations. I drew apiece of warm corn bread about four inches square and one and a
                                    half inches thick and a piece of boiled pork about two inches square, also half a
                                    pint of raw beans and a little salt. Securing my rations in my handkerchief I next
                                    joined the crowd at the paroling office, where after getting pushed and crowded
                                    around for about an hour I

                        On learning that Quirks Scouts or Company B. 14th Ky. Cav. was not recognized I gave
                                    my name in as Co. B. 2d Ky. Cav. as above, as most of my company
                                        were doing. It seems that the 14th Ky. Cav. was not known or
                                    recognized at 
                                        Richmond
                                    . I suppose because it was a new regiment. One of the many railroads
                                    running into 
                                        Richmond
                                     ran right by the Camp and there was a very small engine and a passenger
                                    car attached plying between camp and the city.24 It left camp
                                    every half hour. The fare was one dollar. I only had to wait a few minutes for the
                                    train, and was soon in the city again. Some how I got lost and I missed my lodging
                                    place and could not remember the name of the gentleman of the house nor could I find
                                    any of the boys that were staying at the same house. In my search I came to the
                                    conclusion that there was a good many pretty girls in the City by the number I saw

                                     on the streets. Finally I came across one of
                                    the boys going to the house about dusk, and he piloted me back to Mr. Saddlers. I
                                    found that the boys were calling on their rations for supper. I gave my raw beans to
                                    the cook of the house to boil my coffee for me and falling aboard of my camp corn
                                    bread and bacon I soon lost my appetite. I again enjoyed my crowded cot and about
                                    midnight I heard troops passing through the city cherring loudly, but I did not get
                                    up to see them.

                                        surprised at the appearance the congregation presented. Everything was in order.
                                        The ladies and citizens generally were dressed fine. The officers and soldiers
                                        scattered through the large congregation looked neat and clean, and except when
                                        the eye rested on the soldiers it would appear like times of peace and even then

                                        faces might be seen, some mourning the loss of friends slain in battle, others
                                        regretting keenly the prospects of Confederate defeat and I suppose not a few

                        Monday March 13th, 1865. Weather pleasant. After diving into our rations for our
                                    breakfast, I left Henry White at the house and struck out for E. J. Picot's
                                    drug store and got my baggage. Our provisions were all right. I then visited a
                                    market house to see what I could find. The place was small but I suppose there are
                                    others in the city. There was a very good supply of vegetables. I bought a hat full
                                    of half rotted apples for $3 (Confed.). As we were going to leave the
                                    city soon for somewhere, I concluded to see all of the city I could. I visited the
                                    famous Libby prison and found it to be a plain three story brick cotton warehouse.
                                    Entering the office I learned that all of the Yankee prisoners had just been sent
                                    off that morning, but obtained permission to go through the house. Each floor was
                                    bare except here and there a small table and a good deal of old clothing and rubbish
                                    scattered about over the floor. The place was not a paradise of cleanliness, yet I
                                    have quartered (as a prisoner) in places in comparison to which Libby was a paradise. Their back windows gave them a fine view of the
                                        James River. One of the guards said that there used to
                                        
                              
                                 25 Because of the unchecked printing of paper money
                                            not backed by hard cash in the Confederacy, there occurred "the
                                            greatest inflation ever seen in 
                                                America
                                             with the possible exception of the Revolutionary period
                                            … after 
                                                Gettysburg
                                             the currency fell so rapidly that in August, 1863, the dollar
                                            was equal to only eight cents in gold; in January, 1864, four and one-half
                                            cents; and in March, 1865, less than two cents." Apparently,
                                            however, the cost of living based on gold was lower in the South than in the
                                            North and

                                     be good bunks all through the house but the
                                    Yanks whittled and broke them down and burned them. They were replaced and again
                                    were destroyed, after which they were never replaced. I next went to Castle Thunder
                                    and found a more comfortable looking place, but saw no prisoners. Next visiting the
                                    capitol, I saw a very large bronze statue of Gen. Washington and other smaller
                                    statues in the small but well regulated park surrounding the capitol building, which
                                    stood on a slight elevation. As congress was in session I entered and ascended to
                                    the gallery of the senate chamber. The room looked neat and plain. A very fine life
                                    size painting of Gen. Lee hung back of the President seat. The members were quietly
                                    discussing some question relative to army appointments. I staid but a few minutes,
                                    visiting the house of representatives also. I saw some beautiful paintings at a
                                    picture gallery in the city, one of them representing Mosby preparing to make a dash
                                    on a Federal wagon train.26 I then took the train for Camp Lee
                                    and arrived just in time to draw rations. I have forgotten to mention the crowds of
                                    hucksters and peddlers that infested the camp. Women with pies, cakes, meat and
                                    bread, etc., children with apples, peanuts, etc. and old nigers with traveling bars
                                    (jug in one hand and a wine glass holding about six thimbles full in the other) at
                                    three dollars a drink, generally apple brandy. I indulged in a glass, but could not
                                    determine whether it was good or not. Others, better judges after trying half a
                                    dozen or more glasses pronounced it excellent. There was several sheds occupied by
                                    darkies who had stoves up and hot meals on tables at their doors. A plate pretty
                                    well filled was worth five dollars. Puddings and dumplings seemed to be the favorite
                                    dishes, but a mixed dish could be had at some of the tables containing chicken,
                                    bread, and vegetables. I tried a plate of the dumplings at two dollars and thought
                                    them fine but wondered if they were made 
                              
                                 26 Libby Prison had been the warehouse of Libby and
                                            Sons, ship chandlers, before the war. Only officers had been held there and
                                            it was notorious for abuses of the prisoners and bad living conditions.
                                            After May, 1864, it was used mainly as a temporary shelter. Boatner, The Civil War Dictionary, 482. There are various documents
                                            concerning Libby throughout the Official Records and
                                            numerous prisoners' accounts. Also see William Best Hesseltine, Civil War Prisons: A Study in War Psychology (

                                            political prisoners. "Occasionally holding spies and criminals
                                            charged with treason, it had an unsavory reputation, and its officers were

                                    roll call and I then took the next train for the city of

                                    through the lines. After over hauling my haversack for supper I went to a theatre up
                                    town that had been built during the war and saw a full house and a good play;
                                    admission two dollars. I then returned to my lodging and was glad to find that I had
                                    all of the cot to myself, so I rested well.

                                     and have never been south. They leave by train on the fifteenth but get
                                    off at 
                                        Roanoke
                                     to investigate the death of Burke's cousin, the Reverend John
                                    Burke, son of William Burke of Canton. They reach the plantation of the Reverend
                                    John T. Clark, where Burke's cousin had lived and was now buried. They are
                                    received quite well, and the next day Burke sees the grave and hears the story of
                                    his cousin's death in defense of a Confederate held bridge: "thus
                                    a brave Christian youth of northern parentage and raising, gave his life for the
                                    cause of the Southern people, which he conscientiously believed to be right. I do
                                    not know wheather he knew that his father was a division Quarter Master in the
                                    Yankee army in the west or not" (p. 435). The Clarks persuade Burke and 
                                        White
                                     to remain for more of their furloughs, and the men spend several
                                    restful and pleasing days. On March 21 Burke records a welcome news item:
                                    "I read the good news in a Southern paper that my squad of paroled and
                                    furloughed Rebs had been exchanged, and we would be expected to report to our
                                    commands as soon as our furloughs run out" (p. 437)."]
                        Monday April 3d, 1865. Weather pleasant. After breakfast I and Henry White were very
                                    agreeably surprised on receiving a nice pair of socks apiece, sent us by Miss Eliza
                                    Simms an admirable kind hearted young lady in the neighborhood. God bless her and
                                    may longlife and happiness attend her. I suppose she must of heard us say that we
                                    intended to leave in a few days. There is exciting news a float that 
                                        Richmond
                                     is being evacuated, but we are not prepared to believe it yet, as we
                                    don't know of any cause for it. Mr. Clark let me read a letter that he had
                                    received from my cousin Mrs. Rob't M. Delaplain of Wheeling, W. Va. She is
                                    a sister of the late Rev. John Burke. I and Henry White walked seven miles over to
                                    Clover depot on a scout to learn the news. And the first thing we heard was that 
                                        Anderson
                                    's corps and Picket's division was cut off and
                                    retreating towards Burkesville and that Wise's Brigade was cut all to
                                    pieces.
                        
                           
                              27 The only official Confederate notice located indicates
                                        that as of March "All Confederate officers and men who were delivered
                                        in James River,

                                        be exchanged." Presumably similar declarations followed for prisoners
                                        delivered after that date. On May 6 in

                                        , however, Burke signs another parole which may indicate he was in
                                        error at this earlier date. According to a Federal report of March 23, 1865,

                                    in time for our supper tired, hungry and cast down in spirits.

                        Monday April 10th, 1865. Weather rainy. After breakfast we gathered up our baggage
                                    after a big lunch had been put in our haversack and shook hands with all of the
                                    family and the school boys and the nearest darkies. They all appeared sorry to see
                                    us go, and Mr. Clark told us that we must come to see him again if we ever had a
                                    chance, which we assured him we would only be too glad to do if we were ever so
                                    fortunate as to have the chance, and that we would remember the kindness of himself
                                    and family the rest of our lives. We got to Clover depot just as a long freight
                                    train stopped loaded with goods and army supplies. We presented our transportation
                                    tickets to the conductor and he allowed us to get on where there was a lot of other
                                    soldiers. We were soon under way and when we got to Wolfstrap we had to change cars
                                    as the train was not going any farther in our direction. The news here was that Gen.
                                    Lee had surrendered with 12,000 men. We got underway again and passed South 
                                        Boston
                                     and a river. We got to

                                    and soldiers. We got off and after looking around for awhile we took possession of
                                    an empty ambulance and spread our supper out of our haversacks. After which I sat
                                    for about an hour and saw a gang of darkies carrying kegs of money and bullion from
                                    a car to another train between a line of guards and as soon as it was all aboard I
                                    saw President Jeff Davis and company get aboard and the train moved off under a
                                    strong guard that would not let us ride so we slept in the ambulance all night.29

                                        had been sent by General Robert E. Lee to help reorganize Pickett's

                                    are unable to get a train farther south because of the overcrowding with troops and
                                    supplies.]
                        Sunday April 16th, 1865. Weather cloudy. We cooked our breakfast at the camp fire and
                                    at last we got aboard of a train on the North Caroline R. R. The engine, backing and
                                    pulling train, the tender which was in front filled with wood was crowded with
                                    unarmed men and the box cars were full inside and on top. I and Henry White getting
                                    inside about the center of the train. About seven miles from Charlotte N. C. we had
                                    a terrible accident. The car I was in stopped suddenly with a jerk right in the
                                    middle of a trestle across a branch and I looked out quick to see what was the
                                    matter, and saw the tender and engine off the track and the men and wood scattered
                                    around on the ground. We dropped our baggage to the ground then got out of the car
                                    onto the trestle and climbed down the timbers to the ground, and going forward we
                                    saw that the engine and tender had just gotton off of the trestle when they struck a
                                    loosened rail and left the track and plunged down the embankment. The engine
                                    ploughed into the ground and turned partly over, but the tender broke loose and
                                    rolled over and over down the hill over the men that were on it. The engineer was
                                    almost cut in two laying dead pinned under the wheel of his engine. I think the
                                    firemen was also killed. Those men nearest that were unhurt had already picked up
                                    the dead and wounded and laid them on the grass near by. There was about 12 dead and
                                    15 or 20 wounded. Everybody seemed excited and there was a cry for doctors, so I
                                    told 
                                        Henry
                                     that we had better run to the nearest house and have a runner sent to
                                    Charlotte for doctors. He agreed, and we ran about half a mile down the railroad to
                                    the first house, where we got a man on horse to ride into town. After which not
                                    careing to go back to look at the sickening sight, we concluded to walk on into
                                    town, but before we got there our hard new shoes had rubbed our feet so sore that we
                                    could hardly walk. An extra train went out to the wreck consisting of an engine and
                                    several cars to bring in the dead and the wounded. A lady gave us supper while we
                                    related all about the wreck. We then went uptown and got permission to sleep in a
                                    porch.
                        Tuesday April 18th, 1865. Weather still pleasant. We have concluded to stay here for
                                    a few days to see how things are going. There are so many wild rumors from Gen.
                                        Johnson30 that nobody seems to 
                              
                                 30 This refers to General Joseph E. Johnston who was
                                            commanding the Army of 
                                                Tennessee
                                             in operations against William T. Sherman in the Carolinas.

                                     know which way to go. The Yanks are evidently
                                    closing in on us. We went to the commissary and drew one days rations each, which
                                    was charged up to us on our furloughs as follows:
                                        Three Rations C. H. Elms A. Com. Apl. 18
                                     We did not tramp around much today on account of our tender feet. The town
                                    is getting full of stragglers. We slept in the porch.
                        Wednesday April 19th, 1865. Weather pleasant. We got an old black woman to make us
                                    some coffee and cook some bread and paid her some of our rations. There is a
                                    startling rumor afloat that President Abe Lincoln has been killed. That he was
                                    assassinated last Friday the 14th inst. at a Theater. I was sorry to hear that an
                                    enemy had fallen in that way and I heard expressions of regret freely expressed on
                                    all sides. It was announced that there would be speaking and a large crowd gathered,
                                    when President Jeff Davis and Gen. G. F. Beauregard addressed as saying that they
                                    were extremely sorry to hear of Mr. Lincoln tragic death. That no one regreted it
                                    more than they did. They were glad to see so many of our soldiers still loyal to the
                                    Southern cause, and hoped the dark clouds of adversity would be dispelled, but come
                                    what will to be patient and honorably accept the inevitable; that they could not
                                    foretell future events. They were frequently cheered during their remarks and we
                                    concluded from their remarks that every man was expected to look out for No. 131 Yankee raiders have been burning the railroad bridges near
                                    here so that some of the trains can't leave here. We hear rumors of an
                                    armistice, and that flags of truce have been flying around in all directions which
                                    looks like things are coming to a close. We got permission to sleep on the floor at
                                    the hotel and it is well we did for it rained very hard during the night.
                        Thursday April 20th, 1865. Weather bright and clear. We got our breakfast from our
                                    haversacks. It is reported that Gen. Johnson and 
                              asked for an armistice on April 13 and surrendered on April 26. Boatner,

                                 31 Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth at
                                            Ford's Theatre, 
                                                Washington

                                             are various. It does seem, however, that Burke in substance
                                            agrees. There was receipt of a telegram announcing Lincoln's death
                                            and it was read to a crowd of people; Davis at some point expressed regret
                                            at the assassination; Davis at some point complimented the Confederate
                                            soldiers and, according to Duke, made "a manly, courageous appeal
                                            to the people to be true to themselves." Duke, A

                                    are leaving town fast. We put down our blankets, etc. in a front porch early on
                                    account of guards patroling the town after dark and demanding passes.
                        Friday April 21st, 1865. Weather pleasant. We saw a Yankee flag of truce come into
                                    Headquarters on business, but could not learn what it was. Col. Chas. Thomas and
                                    Major J. R. Viley of Ky. also Gen. John C. Breckinridge32 were
                                    on hand. I joined a crowd and heard a late Northern paper read. I hear that the
                                    soldiers are all ordered to leave Charlotte.
                        [They miss one train but finally get places later on the twenty-second. On the
                                    twenty-third they get as far as 
                              Chester, North Carolina
                           ,
                                    by train and then strike out on foot towards Shelton. On April 26 they arrive in
                                    Alston and remain there the next day. Burke mentions on the twenty-sixth that
                                    "The Northern papers are already talking of reconstructing the South, so I
                                    suppose we are done for" (p. 447). Prices in Alston are typically high:
                                    $10 for dinner, $5 for a pint of sorghum molasses, and whiskey
                                    for $10 per drink or $100 per gallon in Confederate money.]
                        Friday April 28th, 1865. Weather pleasant. We are anxious to get away from Alston. We
                                    hunted up the Commissary and drew two days' rations each, of flour, bacon
                                    and salt. It clouded up and went to raining, and seeing a train on the branch
                                    railroad to Abbeville, twelve miles distant about ready to start, we boarded it
                                    presented our transportation tickets and were soon in Abbeville our objective point.
                                    We put up at the Abbeville Hotel and took a walk over the town to see the sights,
                                    and some of 
                                        Morgan
                                    's command Judge Monroe, Wm. Messick and others met us and said
                                    that they were going on South perhaps to E. Curby Smith's command in 
                                        Texas
                                    .33 We learned that grub was pretty high at the
                                    hotel, so we took our rations to a house and had them cooked, but they were badly
                                    cooked. We then found some kindling and coal and made a fire in our room, as it was
                                    damp and chilly. We eat our own rations for supper in our room, where we slept on a
                                    mattress on a square bed stead.
                        Saturday April 29th, 1865. Weather clear and pleasant again. We drew on our
                                    haversacks for breakfast in our little room. The hotel was crowded with soldiers,
                                    mostly officers. We then took a walk visiting the Episcopal Church and a fine flower
                                    and plant garden. This is a great town for flowers and they seem to grow to
                                    perfection.
                        
                           
                              32 General John C. Breckinridge had been appointed
                                        Confederate secretary of war by Davis on February 4, 1865. Boatner, The Civil War Dictionary, 83.
                           
                              33 General Edmund Kirby Smith was in 
                                            Texas
                                         in command of the Trans-

                                         Department. His was the last Confederate force to
                                        surrender—on May 26 to General Edward R. S. Canby. Ibid., 770, 822.
                        
                        
                        Nearly every house has a big variety of them, and the air is laden with their rich
                                    perfume. We could not resist the temptation to steal a little bouquet. We returned
                                    to our room to eat a snack for dinner and then gathered up all the soiled cloths we
                                    had and took them to an old colored woman to be washed. Winder Monroe and Messick
                                    left for Augusta Ga. with Mrs. Jeff Davis & company. They are still on the
                                    retreat aiming to get to a place of safety. More released Yankee prisoners passed
                                    through on their way home. They said the war was about over and they were glad of
                                    it. Everybody ought to go home and repair the damages as much as possible. We said
                                    we were not quite willing to give up all hopes yet. We returned to our room and eat
                                    a snack and sang Do They Miss me At Home?
                        Sunday April 30th, 1865. Weather clear and warm. The old darkie brought our cloths
                                    while we were ating our breakfast. "Massy here's de
                                    clos." All there aunty? "Yes guess dey is".
                                    What's your bill? "Foteen dollas. Ebry tings so hi, can't
                                    ford to di ti fo les." We paid her with Confed. money and after breakfast
                                    we put the things in our baggage and found six pieces missing, so we went to see the
                                    old darkie about it. She said, "Fo de lawd massy Ize stonished. Dem clos
                                    must blowd ofen de line, or some dees pesky or religus nigs in dis hear cality mus

                                    fotch um rite tu yer, so I'll. Ize onest if I ar black." So we
                                    gave up the things as lost and dropped the matter, and returning to our room we
                                    brushed ourselves up the best we could and went to the Episcopal Church. We owned a
                                    prayer book apiece so we joined in the services. After which we returned to our room
                                    and eat our dinner snack and then walked out to see some of the beautiful flower
                                    gardens. In one of them we heard Miss Lu Buchannan sing several charming pieces. We
                                    then went to the commissary and drew three days' rations each. Some people
                                    next door to the hotel spent most of the evening practicing hymns. It is reported
                                    this evening that the armistice that has been enforced for several days has been
                                    broken or expired. I don't know which. At any rate things are on a war
                                    footing again and we'll have to "shoot Luke or give up the
                                    gun" if we meet any armed Yanks. At night we went to the Presbyterian
                                    Church and heard a good sermon and some good singing.
                        Monday May 1st, 1865. Weather pleasant. May day in the land of flowers. We took our
                                    rations out to a house to be cooked, allowing them to be "tolled"
                                    (as the miller's say) for pay. The town is quite crowded with soldiers and
                                    refugee citizens from further North. Gen. 
                                    Van's command of cavalry passed through town. Gen. B. Duke with the remnant
                                    of 
                                        Morgan
                                    's cavalry is expected tomorrow with Jeff Davis and we hope to
                                    meet many old comrades.34 We got our cooked rations and I gave
                                    one of the hotel waiters a new cotton handkerchief for a quart can of hot coffee.
                                    Gen. Hopkins puts up at our hotel. People are badly worked up and a good deal scared
                                    for fear the Yanks will make a raid on the town. A good many marines, officers and
                                    sailors are arriving from the east. We took several in our little room to sleep with
                                    us.
                        Tuesday May 2d, 1865. Weather pleasant. About two thousand mounted men, the remnants
                                    of several commands and a good many army wagons loaded with army supplies of all
                                    kinds, passed through town. President Jeff Davis and Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge
                                    arrived and were received with loud cheering. We found a good many of our command
                                    and Capt. Williams tried to get horses to mount us, but failed. Horses were in great
                                    demand. Fidel Clarer of 
                                        Lexington
                                    , Ky. left us to try to make his way through to 
                                        Kentucky
                                    . Yankee Cavalry raiders are reported twelve miles from town. A mixed
                                    lot of cavalry men charged the depot and forced the guards to let them have all of
                                    the clothing and provisions they could carry. I and 
                                        Henry
                                     went to Judge Monroe's to see Maj. Lewellen35 and Capt. Tom Quirk about getting mounted, but they could not find any
                                    extra Confederate horses. A good many of the Navy officers are taking the back track
                                    east again, and it looks like a general "skeedaddle" is about to
                                    take place. A car with some ammunition blew up near the depot through carelessness.
                                    I sold a pair of fine boot legs that Clarer left me for fifteen dollars and paid the
                                    hotel clerk that amount for the use of our room. We are passing a better night since
                                    the sailor crowd has left us in full possession again. We heard troops and wagons
                                    moving all night.

                        Friday May 5th, 1865. Weather warm. After eating breakfast we boarded the train for
                                    Barnet Junction, but it was detained until nine o'clock before it got off.
                                    In the front car was $20,000 in silver bullion in charge of a guard. On
                                    arriving at Barnet Junction we all got off and a crowd of the men talked strongly of
                                    charging the bullion car saying that it would fall into the Yanks hand and they
                                    might as well have it, but a Major Moore, G. O. M. finally talked them out of it.
                                    Telling them that the Federal authorities had agreed that if it was left it should
                                    be used for the benefit of the sick and disabled Confederate soldiers in the
                                    hospitals, and if they would let it alone he knew it would be so used. The men
                                    reluctantly left it, and a train for 
                                        Atlanta
                                     came and we all boarded it. We had not gone far before we switched off
                                    and two trains loaded down with armed Yanks and unarmed Rebs passed us going towards 
                                        Atlanta
                                    . The Yanks are in possession of 
                                        Atlanta
                                    " and we feel a little queer about going there, but guess we

                                     we passed a long train filled with Yanks headed east. We passed several
                                    towns and arrived safe at 
                                        Atlanta
                                     late in the evening, and I made my bed on some planks in the depot.
                                    There was so many Yanks around I thought I had better keep close. There was several
                                    showers during the night. I did not sleep much.
                        Saturday May 6th, 1865. Weather pleasant. I got up very early and took a walk up town
                                    to see what 
                                        Atlanta
                                     looked like. I found it a ragged looking place. It looked like it had
                                    been roughly handled. A lot of houses had been burned. I returned to the depot and
                                    the boys were just getting up. We eat a snack from our haversacks and the boys went
                                    out to see the town. I bought a 
                                        Louisville
                                     Courier for one dollar (Confed. money). We don't know which
                                    way to go as the railroad is torn up from here clear to Dalton, a hundred miles.
                                    Some talk of footing it towards 
                                        Knoxville

                                 36 Duke apparently misdates the event but says that
                                            "the men were paid … with a portion of the gold brought
                                            from

                                             is disputed, but one account of the transport of the money
                                            (mainly silver) indicates that almost $400,000 was paid out to

                                     along well together. We went to the Provost
                                    Marshalls office and took the following parole.

                                    I, the undersigned Curtis R. Burke a Private of the second Regiment of Ky. Cav.
                                        Vols, do solemnly swear that I will not bear arms against the 
                                            United States
                                         of America or give any information, or do any Military duty
                                        whatsoever until regularly exchanged as a prisoner of war.
                                    Curtis R. Burke
                                    Description: Height, 5 ft. 8 in.; Hair, 
                                            Auburn
                                        ; Eyes, gray; Complexion, dark.
                                    I certify that the above parole was given by me on the date above written, on the
                                        following conditions: The above named person is allowed to return to his home,
                                        not to be disturbed by the military Authorities of the 
                                            United States
                                        , so long as he observes this parole and obey the laws which were in
                                        force previous to January 1, 1861, where he resided.
                                    By order of Brevet, Maj. Gen. Wilson, Will G. Laweles, Capt. Provost Marshal C.
                                        C. M. D. M.
                                
                        I put my parole in my pocket and going out on the street I met Fidel Clarer and went
                                    with him to his boarding house kept by Mrs. Pucketts. He gave me a pair of pants to
                                    reduce his baggage and then he left with a crowd going to Dalton, Ga. We drew
                                    rations and put them out to a house to be cooked. We eat our supper and went to bed
                                    again at the depot. During the night I heard some Yankee Cavalry and Artillery
                                    passing, singing, We've whipped the Confederacy, aha, aha, etc.
                        Sunday May 7th, 1865. Weather pleasant. We got up early and eat breakfast, as we
                                    intend to leave Atalanta, and went for the rations we left to be cooked. Then four
                                    or five of us struck out from 
                                        Atlanta
                                     on foot for Dalton, about one hundred miles distant, for the railroad
                                    was still torn up for that distance. It had been rebuilt as far east as Dalton up to
                                    that time. We walked seven miles and came to the Chattahoucha
                                        [Chattahoochee] river, which we crossed on a flat boat, the bridge
                                    having been destroyed. I saw a great many deserted earthworks, such as rifle pits
                                    and forts and other signs of the Battle and seige, on the way. We moved on to
                                    Marietta and found most of the place uninhabited and in ruins. We stopped here to
                                    rest and eat some dinner. Doc Garret caught up with us here and took dinner with us.
                                    He said that Gen. Duke's command had disbanded at 
                                        Augusta
                                    , Ga. We then walked on eight and a half miles to Big Shanty taking it
                                    more leisurely gathering flowers and fine strawberries from the gardens where the
                                    tall chimneys were about the only thing that remained of what was once fine well
                                    improved country residences. Not a panel of fence left. All turned out into one vast
                                    waste, with  many bones of cattle, mules and
                                    horses picked by the buzzard, scattered here and there. The sights were distressing
                                    to look at. The destruction was complete, but these people who were brave enough to
                                    fight for their rights may be noble enough to forgive. We stopped to eat our supper
                                    luckily right in a fine wild strawberry bed that helped us out with our supper. We
                                    then found a porch to sleep in. We were very tired having walked about twenty-seven
                                    miles that day in the hot sun.
                        [The men continue "on through the wilderness of waste" on foot
                                    receiving food from Yankees and citizens along the way and sleeping on porches and
                                    in sheds.]
                        Friday May 12th, 1865. Weather a little cool and very windy. We rose before sunrise
                                    and eat a hasty breakfast and struck out for Dalton, Ga., ten miles off. While
                                    passing on our way we saw several squads of men repairing the railroad. We arrived
                                    at 
                                        Dalton
                                     at half past eight o'clock a. m. and went to the office of a
                                    Yankee Lieutenant and presented our paroles to get transportation tickets. He took
                                    the papers saying that he would see about it. We joined a crowd of Conf eds that had
                                    collected in town and were sitting around the courthouse waiting for transportation
                                    tickets. I went to the sutler store and bought a quire of note paper for my diary
                                    and found his prices very high even for greenback money. I had sold several articles
                                    I could spare for a little greenback change, but I and 
                                        Henry
                                     still had our silver money intact, tied up in our old socks. We heard
                                    that every man would get a transportation ticket to his home, so 
                                        Henry
                                     begged me to go to Memphis with him, where his family had removed from 
                                        Lexington
                                    , Ky., and if we could get from there to Gen. E. Kirby Smith's
                                    army in 
                                        Texas
                                     (in the Trans-
                                        Mississippi
                                     department) we would do so and wait for our exchange. So I agreed to go
                                    with him as my mother and family had removed from 
                                        Lexington
                                     also and gone to 
                                        Ohio
                                     to live. So when we were called out in line to see about the
                                    transportations the Lieutenant called for all men that lived in states not seceded
                                    to step to the front in line. I and Henry White remained in line and when asked,
                                    claimed Memphis, Tenn. as our home and received transportation tickets to that
                                    place. After all had gotten their tickets the two lines were marched to separate
                                    places to wait for rations. Fifteen of our mess fell out to draw and bring our
                                    rations to us. Each man got two and a half of those big hard square army crackers
                                    and a piece of salt fish two inches square. We eat a snack and then we were marched
                                    to the freight train and our paroles were given back to us. Then we boarded the
                                    train, we all got awful thirsty, the crackers and salt fish was working on us.
                                    Several of the crowd  got left while out hunting
                                    for water. There was a call for water, water at every place we came to, but we
                                    arrived at 
                                        Chattanooga
                                    , Tenn. thirty-six miles without any accidents, about two hours before
                                    sunset. We were marched to the soldiers Home, a large plain plank building where we
                                    were given a couple of large rooms to stop in, but there was no guards put over us.
                                    We had cooked coffee, crackers and bacon issued to us. After dark there was two
                                    fiddles and dancing without ladies in the other room. At bed time there was a Yankee
                                    guard (or watchman) placed at the door, but he did not interfere with our going out
                                    or coming in. The night was chilly.
                        [They are all kept under guard and Burke and 
                                        White
                                     finally get transportation papers to Memphis on the fourteenth. Burke
                                    goes because he is "very anxious to see a certain member of the 
                                        White
                                     family" (p. 459). On May 15 they set out by train for 
                                        Nashville
                                    . They stop in 
                                        Murfreesboro
                                    , 
                                        Tennessee
                                    , the next day and Burke recalls his previous visit: "I could
                                    see the little brick room back of the jail where I and three other Quirks Scouts had
                                    been held as prisoners for two weeks in January 1863 by Gen. Rosecrans for coming on
                                    a flag of truce errand" (p. 461). They spend some unpleasant time in 
                                        Nashville
                                     and leave by steamer for 
                                        Paducah
                                    , 
                                        Kentucky
                                    , on May 18. On the twentieth at Smithland, 
                                        Kentucky
                                    , there is an exchange of songs with some people in a skiff alongside
                                    while the boat is laid over. At Paducah they get papers for the steamer Ada L." for 
                                        Cairo
                                    , 
                                        Illinois
                                    . On May 21 they arrange for transport from Cairo to Memphis on the
                                    steamer Peytona. While on the wharf they witness a Negro baptism
                                    in the river and receive food from the southern sympathizing wife of a 
                                        Union
                                     officer. After a day on the boat Burke indicates his pleasure at the
                                    experience: "It was the first time I had ever seen the broad old
                                        Mississippi River and I enjoyed the sight of so many boats
                                    passing" (p. 467). They arrive in 
                                        Memphis
                                     on May 22.]
                        Tuesday May 23d, 1865. Weather pleasant. After a late breakfast I and Henry White
                                    went down to the river to see what chance there was to get down the river to 
                                        Texas
                                    , where Gen. E. Kirby Smith was reported to still be in command of an
                                    army that had not surrendered. He commanded the Trans 
                                        Mississippi
                                     Department. We thought we could spend the remaining time on our paroles
                                    down in 
                                        Texas
                                     then join Kirby Smith. We learned that it was not safe to go south by
                                    land as the whole country was alive with bands of both white and black robbers and
                                    murderers, so we thought as soon as we saw Henry's folks we would smuggle
                                    ourselves down to

                                     on some of the boats. We finally found an old fellow with a salt barge
                                    that said he would smuggle us down in his little cabin as far as 
                                        New Orleans
                                     if we could wait three or four days, which we agreed to do and after
                                    watching some steamers come in we returned to the hotel for dinner. After which I
                                    wrote two letters, one to my mother and family in 
                                        Ohio
                                    , and the other to an old friend in 
                                        Lexington
                                    , Ky. I then hunted up 
                              
                                 38 This is, perhaps, the Little Ada.

                                     the postoffice and mailed my letters. Then I
                                    and 
                                        Henry
                                     took a scout over the business portion of the city. We learned that
                                    there had been a big negro row at some fort near 
                                        Memphis
                                     and twenty negroes were reported killed. We went back to the hotel for
                                    our supper and bed.
                        Wednesday May 24th, 1865. Weather very warm. After breakfast we paid our bill which
                                    took about all the greenback money we had. We then learned where Mr. Wm. Y.
                                    Cirode's store was and went to it, and we were then taken to his home where
                                    we met a warm welcome. We found Henry's sister, Mrs. Cirode and his two
                                    single sisters Ella and Annie all well. I thought Miss Ella, my old school mate
                                    sweetheart looked awful nice and I began to wonder what she thought of me now since
                                    my three years absence in the war, so I resolved to find out before I left the city.
                                    After dinner I and 
                                        Henry
                                     went down to Mr. Cirode's Commission house and sat around
                                    awhile where the drays were busy unloading and loading goods. We noticed the busy
                                    scene on the levee and at the wharf boats. Three steamers came up the river loaded
                                    with freight and Confederates from Gen. E. Kirby Smith's army. The steamers
                                    landed and some of the Confederates stopped off here and said that everybody below
                                    had surrendered and there was no use to go down there. So we gave up our trip in
                                    that direction. Henry White said he would stay in 
                                        Memphis
                                     awhile with his folks until he could find something to make a living
                                    at, but as for myself I felt like I was left and could hardly make up my mind what
                                    to do. The war was surely over and I could not help from thinking of the oft
                                    repeated refrain of comrades Leek, Arnett and James Harrison of "Oh what
                                    shall we do when this war breaks up". I still had my thirty-two Mexican
                                    silver dollars in my old socks. The last pay of the Confederate Government, and I
                                    concluded to get a citizen's outfit with the money and try to get some kind
                                    of work in the city for awhile at least until my finances got in better shape, so I
                                    went to a Jew clothing store and bought a black cloth suit, hat, shoes, etc. and a
                                    cheap valise. I changed clothes and put my old gray uniform in the valise and went
                                    back to Mr. Cirode's. They looked surprised at my change. Miss Anne had
                                    admired my silver star and cresent on my hat so I gave it to her for a memento of
                                    me. I passed the evening very pleasantly with the family playing games until late
                                    bed time. When I and 
                                        Henry
                                     retired we had such a cozy room and bed and we slept like two logs.
                        Thursday May 25th, 1865. Weather pleasant. After breakfast I took a walk down to Mr.
                                    Cirode's store. It was some distance as Nor Cirode lived in the suburbs. I
                                    then tried several wholesale houses for a job, but could find none. Every place was
                                    full of help. I went into a lunch stand and got a cup of coffee and a ham sandwich
                                    for my  dinner. After which I met Mr. James
                                    Maydwell of 
                                        Lexington
                                    , Ky., who showed me around for awhile and invited me to go and stay all
                                    night with him and I did.
                        Friday May 26th, 1865. Weather pleasant. After breakfast I left Mr.
                                    Maydwell's with a determination to find a job if I possibly could. I spent
                                    most of the day going in and out of every place of business for a good many squares,
                                    but could find no opening, and I gave up in disgust, and made up my mind to go back
                                    to my "Old 
                                        Kentucky
                                     Home" at 
                                        Lexington
                                    , if I had to walk there. I met Mr. Maydwell on the street and he told
                                    me that Mrs. G. Goyer, a strong Southern lady belonged to some society that had been
                                    helping Southern soldiers to get home and if I would go to see her she might assist
                                    me, so I got her number and street and called on her. She received me very kindly
                                    and I stated that I would like to get some assistance to get back to 
                                        Lexington
                                    , Ky. She told me to call again tomorrow as she thought they could
                                    assist me. I then went back to Mr. Cirode's and they wanted to know if I
                                    did not get lost as I was away over night. I spent a pleasant evening in the parlor
                                    again, but I came to the conclusion that Miss Ella was a little shy of me and I
                                    retired very uneasy and considerably worked up and laid awake most of the night
                                    wondering if my best girl was going to throw me over, give me the cold shoulder.
                        Saturday May 27th, 1865. Weather pleasant. After breakfast 
                                        Henry
                                     went down to the store and I remained at the house hoping to get a
                                    chance to have a private talk with Miss Ella, but the opportunity did not occur in
                                    time to suit my impatience, so I went to my bed room and wrote her a note, saying
                                    that I was going back to old 
                                        Kentucky
                                     and that I had loved her long and well, and begged to know if I might
                                    hope to win her love, when the battle of life shall have placed me in a position to
                                    claim it. As I passed out not seeing Miss Ella I handed the sealed note to Miss
                                    Annie, who promised to give it to her sister Ella. I went on down town and went to
                                    see Mrs. Goyer again, who gave me a ten dollar green back bill and said if I thought
                                    I would need more she would increase it, but I thanked her and the other ladies and
                                    told her that with what I had and other chances I could get home. I then met some
                                    southern men downtown and they told me that if I would go to the Provost
                                    Marshall's office and take the Federal oath I could get transportation to 
                                        Louisville
                                    , Ky. by steamer, so I concluded the best thing for me was to take the
                                    oath and get the transportation papers. I went to the Provost Marshall's
                                    office and gave my name and command, etc. and asked for U. S. Transportation papers
                                    to 
                                        Louisville
                                    , Ky., but the Provost Marshall said he could only give me a pass to
                                    Cairo, 111. on the Steamer Robt. Burns that was going up the river  that evening and I would have to take the oath. I said
                                    all right and they filled up the blanks and I signed them (making me a loyal citizen
                                    of the

                        I took dinner at a restaurant and read a city paper for an hour trying to steady my
                                    nerves for the coming test. I dreaded to face my fate, yet I felt I must settle it
                                    before I left. I struck out to Mr. Cirode's to get my answer and my valise.
                                    On entering the front door I did not see anyone and so went straight on up to my bed
                                    room where I found a note in my valise handle and with trembling hands I opened it
                                    and read.
                        
                                    
                              
                                 
                                    Mr. Burke:
                                    Please pardon me for saying you had better go home and find some one
                                                    more congenial than I might be,
                                    
                                                    Resp't,
                                                    Ella.
                                                
                                 
                              
                           
                                
                        I dropped the note and picked it up again and re-read it to be sure my eyes had not
                                    fooled me, then I rammed it in my pocket with a long sigh of regret and grabing my
                                    valise as I exclaimed another "Lost Cause" on my shoulders. I
                                    heard some one down in the hall at the front door, so I tried to calm down to say
                                    good-by as I passed out. I met Mrs. Cirode and Miss Annie who hoped I would have a
                                    safe trip home and shook hands with me and said good-by, and remarked that

                                            allegiance.
                           
                                     Ella was out calling so I left my good-by for
                                    her with them, feeling thankful that I had been spared the cruel pain and
                                    mortification of telling her good-by under the circumstances. I struck out for the
                                    Steamer in a dazed sort of mind realizing that my boyhood's best hopes and
                                    the hopes that I had fondly cherished during the long war was now dashed to pieces.
                                    Mr. Cirode's store was near the river, so I dropped in there and told him
                                    and Henry White good-by and then boarded the Steamer Robert Burns shaking the dust
                                    of 
                                        Memphis
                                     off of my unlucky feet. I left my valise in the office and took my seat
                                    on the porch and watched the deck hands finish the loading, while thinking I had
                                    been

                        When the freight was aboard we got started up the river about lamp light. There was a

                                     ahead of me, and all seemed in jolly spirits. The steamer was crowded
                                    and after partaking of a fine supper the parlor and ladies cabin end of the steamer
                                    were cleared and a string band put in an appearance and dancing was soon progressing
                                    for anyone that felt like it. The tables in the fore part of the cabin were used for
                                    others to play cards, chess, dominos, and checkers. The officers of the steamer
                                    seemed to be trying to make all of the passengers enjoy themselves. About half past
                                    ten o'clock the music stopped and bed time gong was sounded. Extra cots
                                    were spread along in the cabin and I was assigned to cot four, where I retired as
                                    soon as all of the ladies had retired to their state rooms. The tremor of the
                                    steamer and the gentle jingle of the prism glass drops on the big chandaliers soon
                                    lulled me to sleep as the gallant steamer continued to plow the water on her way up
                                    the broad 
                                        Mississippi

                        Wednesday May 31st, 1865. Weather pleasant. After breakfast I joined a checker game
                                    for a couple of hours. We passed the Steamer Major Anderson crowded with passengers
                                    and freight. Next came the stately double cabin U. S. Mail Packett. She also seemed
                                    to be alive with passengers. Some were Federal soldiers returning home and from the
                                    way they cheered as they passed I thought they were as glad to be going home as we,
                                    the Confederates were. We passed a good many towns, most of them on the Indiana
                                    side, during the day. The band on our steamer gave us some music at several of the
                                    landings. We reached 
                              Cincinnati,
                                            Ohio
                           , just after supper
                                    which is the end of the steamer's trip being 796 miles from 
                                        Memphis
                                    , 
                                        Tenn.
                                     I went ashore with a Mr. Akes and with him to the Allegheny House near
                                    the river kept by a Mr. Fowler, where I got a bed but I did not like the looks of
                                    some of the people I saw in the house and became too suspicious and wakeful to rest
                                    very much.
                        Thursday June 1st, 1865. Weather pleasant. After breakfast I wrote two letters, one
                                    to my mother in or near 
                                        Spencer
                                    , Medina Co.

                                     and the other to an old friend in 
                                        Lexington
                                    , Ky. my old home. I did not know how the Yanks were treating returning
                                    reb. soldiers, so I thought I would find out before I decided which way I would go
                                    next, North or South. I went over to Covington, Ky. and hung around the depot to see
                                    if I could see anyone from 
                                        Lexington
                                     on the train that I knew or could talk to safely. I loafed around the
                                    depot most all day, but did not see anyone that I thought it safe to speak to. I
                                    looked around the city awhile and then recrossed the river to the Alleghany  House in time for supper. I felt awful hungry
                                    as I had missed my dinner, so I made the supper hum. A steamboat load of picnic
                                    folks landed at the wharf with a band playing. The steamer was all aglow with
                                    lights, and the people soon passed up into the city in high glee. I heard that there
                                    was a man held up and robbed on the bridge not far from here and I saw the police
                                    looking around for suspects. I did not venture out from the house and retired early
                                    always taking care to hide what little money I had on my person.

                                    he sees in a newspaper that Davis will "be turned over to the civil

                        Tuesday June 6th, 1865. Weather warm. After breakfast I took a stroll through the
                                    market house. It seemed to be well stocked. I then went to Mr. Hall's
                                    marble shop again and was introduced to several returned Rebs. and southern
                                    sympathizers who insisted on treating and I tried a glass of beer but I did not like
                                    it, so I treated next time and took a glass of Lemonade. Then looking at my cash on
                                    hand I saw that I had just enough left to pay bill at the 
                                        Dover
                                    's Inn and buy a ticket to

                                    , but what was to be done with my unpaid bill at the Alleghany Hotel, I
                                    did not know, but after thinking it over I concluded to go over to the Alleghany
                                    Hotel and propose to leave my valise with Mr. Fowler as security for my five dollar
                                    board bill until I got to 
                                        Lexington
                                    , when I would remit him his money and he could send me my valise by
                                    express. So over I bolted and found him perfectly willing to accept my proposition.
                                    I returned to the 
                                        Dover
                                    's Inn, paid my bill and bought my ticket for 
                                        Lexington
                                    . I had heard from several that returning rebs were not molested in 
                                        Lexington
                                    . I stept into a bakery and eat a lunch for dinner, then got on the
                                    train early to get rid of the awful flying dust. In due time after an uneventful
                                    trip we arrived in 
                                        Lexington
                                    . My Old

                                         home after an absence of nearly three years as a Confederate
                                    soldier. My mother and children had moved north, but I might find some of my old
                                    friends still there. I began to look to see what changes three years had made. I
                                    struck out down Short Street with queer feelings of mingled interest and doubt. And
                                    the first man that I met was an old family acquaintance, old man Henry A. Saxon, Sr.
                                    the famous brass band man. He grabbed my hand and almost shook it out of joint. I
                                    was as glad to see him as he was to see me. He asked me where I was going. I told
                                    him I did not know. He asked me what I was going to do, I replied I did not know
                                    yet. He said, "Well you know where I live don't you." I
                                    replied I used to know. He said, "Well I live at the same old place and you
                                    go right there and make yourself at home until you see what  you are going to do for a living. My folks will be
                                    awful glad to see you. I'll be home after a while." I felt very
                                    thankful for such unexpected kindness and expressed my feelings to him and promised
                                    to go to his house. I wandered on down town and met a few old friends and some
                                    returned 
                                        Morgan
                                    's men, but most of the crowds seemed to be strangers. There
                                    was a good many 
                                        Union
                                     soldiers still in the city. I went up to Mr. Saxton's in time
                                    for supper and was warmly welcomed by the family. After supper I took a stroll down
                                    in the City and found my brother Alonzo E. Burke at a boarding house, and he told me
                                    that he had received a letter from our mother in 
                                        Ohio
                                     saying that she and the children were well and that father (Edward D.
                                    Burke) had been released as a prisoner of war, at Camp Douglas, 
                                        Chicago
                                    , 111.41 and was with the family sound and well. I
                                    returned to Mr. Saxton's at early bed time for fear I might discommode
                                    them.
                        Wednesday June 7th, 1865. Weather still warm. I went down in the city soon after
                                    breakfast and looked around for a job to make a living at, but the city was overrun
                                    with strangers, the leavings of the war and jobs were very scarce, but I got a job
                                    at house painting from a Mr. Cash Parker at one dollar and twenty-five cents per
                                    day, so I went to Mr. Solman Rice's boarding house on Vine st. and engaged
                                    board and went and bid my Saxton friends good-by. So I was soon able to send back to
                                    the Alleghany Hotel, 
                              Cincinnati,
                                            Ohio
                           , for my valise and
                                    received it in due time with my Confederate suit all safe.

                                    Can we ever forget when he joined the brave band Who rose in defense of our dear
                                        Southern land, And, in his bright youth, hurried on to the fray, How proudly he
                                        donned it, the jacket of gray!
                                    His fond mother blessed him, and looked up above, Commending to heaven, the child
                                        of her love, What anguish was hers, mortal tongue may not say, When he passed
                                        from our sight in the jacket of gray.
                                    But her country had called, and she would not repine, Though costly the sacrifice
                                        placed on its shrine; 
                                 
                                    41 All prisoners had been released from Camp

                                        sword, and lighted the brand, We heard in the distance the sound of the fray,
                                        And prayed for our boys in the jacket of gray.42
                           
                                    Ah, vair [vain], all, all, were our prayers and our tears; The glad shout of
                                        victory rang in our ears; But our treasured ones on the red battle field lay,
                                        While the life blood oozed out on the jacket of gray.
                                    His young comrades found him, and tenderly bore The cold lifeless form to his
                                        home on the shore; Oh! dark was our hearts on that terrible day, When we saw our
                                        dead boy in the jacket of gray.
                                    Ah! spotted and tattered and stained now with gore Was the garment which once he
                                        so proudly wore; We bitterly wept as we took it away, And replaced with
                                        Death's white robes, the jacket of gray.
                                    We laid him to rest in his cold narrow bed, And graved o'er the marble
                                        we placed o'er his head, As the proudest of tributes our sad hearts
                                        could pay, "He never disgraced the jacket of gray."
                                    Then fold it up carefully, lay it aside, Tenderly touch it, look on it with
                                        pride— For dear must it be, to our hearts evermore— The

                        Wayfaring Foreigners, Itinerants, and Peripatetic Hoosiers. Compiled by Shirley S. McCord.

            Not since the publication in 1916 of Indiana As Seen by Early Travellers, edited by
                    the late Harlow Lindley, has the Indiana Historical Bureau (the successor to the Indiana Historical
                    Commission which was responsible for the publication of Lindley's compilation) essayed a
                    similar production. As the earlier publication has been a valuable source of information, and of
                    pleasure, to all those who are interested in the pioneer period, so will the present volume by
                    Shirley McCord serve now and in the future. The Lindley volume has been long out of print and is
                    limited to the pioneer period. McCord's compilation is much broader in scope, beginning as
                    it does with an excerpt from Father Louis Hennepin describing his experiences at the portage from
                    the 
                        St. Joseph
                     of the Lakes to the headwaters of the Kankakee (on the site of present day 
                        South Bend
                    ) and ending with a description of certain picturesque areas of southern Indiana by
                    William L. (Tubby) Toms taken from his column in the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    News in 1961.
            The text is divided into five chapters or periods: the "French and British," the
                    "Territorial," the "Pioneer," the later "Nineteenth
                    Century," and the "Twentieth Century." The pioneer period, 1817-1847, has
                    the largest number of selections and the "Twentieth Century," the least. Perhaps,
                    as Hubert H. Hawkins suggests in the Preface, there were more "journal-keeping
                    travellers" in the first half of the nineteenth century than now. Perhaps also, travelling
                    is not the adventure in the present century as it was then.
            Each selection is preceded by a short explanatory sketch, identifying the author and the source and
                    giving any other information which the compiler deemed relevant. Even a cursory reading of the
                    introductory paragraphs reveals the research that was necessary to compile these travel accounts.
                    Many of the publications from which the selections have been made are not readily available to the
                    average reader. There are sixteen pages of notes which adequately identify people, places, and
                    events with which the reader–average or specialist–might not be familiar.
            The end maps are very clear and enable the reader to locate the places named in the text. They are
                    especially accurate as to the rivers and streams. These bodies of water, perhaps, constituted the
                    greatest obstacles to the traveller, especially in the pioneer period. There are  also two contemporary maps within the body of the text, illustrative of
                    a particular selection
            The Appendix contains a list of "documents, diaries, journals, etc" that were
                    examined but not used. It constitutes, a good reading list for students of Indiana history
                    providing, of course, that items are available. The Index is very complete. Geographically (as well
                    as chronologically) the selections present a well balanced view of Indiana.
            In brief, Travel Accounts of Indiana, 1679-1961 is a very readable and a scholarly
                    addition to the Indiana Historical Collections. It should appeal to all readers,
                    and Indiana history teachers should find it very helpful as supplementary reading. McCord has
                    produced a very creditable compilation.

            In Indian history one can run a mile yet move a foot. Fortunately Bert Anson's study of the 
                        Miami
                     moves a mile. Though the author acquaints the reader with Indian life, the central
                    theme treats of how the 
                        Miami
                     responded to the French, British, and Americans from the eighteenth through the
                    twentieth centuries. Anson relates that in the early 1700s the Miamis, a part of the 
                        Illinois
                     tribes, began moving into present Indiana. By mid century the Miamis had extended their
                    villages south and east until their hegemony covered most of Indiana and part of western 
                        Ohio
                    . Because of their strategic location, however, they became embroiled in the
                    French-British competition for empire. The Miamis' diplomatic and military intrigues with
                    the Europeans provided these warriors with the skills that they needed to deal with the Americans
                    during the Revolutionary Era.
            Anson's reliance on secondary sources cannot be faulted, but his use of more recent studies
                    would have provided a clearer view of the French and British periods of contact. In explaining
                    British Indian policy before and after the American Revolution the author fails to utilize Jack
                    Sosin's Whitehall and the Wilderness: the Middle West in British Colonial
                        Policy, 1760-1775 (1961) or Reginald Horsman's biography of British Indian agent
                    Matthew Elliott (1964). Horsman contends that in the 1790s Lieutenant Governor John G. Simcoe of 
                        Upper Canada
                     favored formation of an Indian buffer state in the Old Northwest; Anson denies this (p.
                    191). Also, there is no mention  that the 
                        Miami
                     chief Pacanne traveled to 
                        Canada
                     and held consultations with Simcoe. How French and British policy affected the 
                        Miami
                     nation does not stand forth as sharply as it should.
            Anson emphasizes the Treaty of Greenville of 1795 as marking a basic change in the Miamis'
                    attitude toward the 
                        United States
                    . Even the great 
                        Miami
                     war chief Little Turtle accepted American friendship and afterward expended much effort
                    in the cause of pacifism. The author declares that during the War of 1812 the American government
                    advised the Miamis to remain neutral and then without warning attacked some of their towns. Such
                    government measures were both unwise and unjust. It should be stated, however, that the 
                        Delaware
                     of Indiana Territory, and the Shawnee and Wyandot of 
                        Ohio
                     escaped attacks by moving closer to the settlements of 
                        Ohio
                     where they could be watched. The 
                        Miami
                     accepted the policy of neutrality but not that of temporary removal. In the period
                    following the War of 1812 the author ably explains the breakdown of traditional 
                        Miami
                     life, their dealings with pioneer Hoosiers, and government relations leading to the
                    tribe's removal to lands beyond the Mississippi River. Readers will be
                    surprised to learn that many Miamis were exempt from migration because of family ties. Since removal
                    there has been a split in the 
                        Miami
                    –the Indiana and the western or 
                        Oklahoma
                    . For a century the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs recognized only the western 
                        Miami
                     as a tribal entity. Assimilation was the word characterizing the government's
                    view of the Indiana 
                        Miami
                    .
            Most commendable is the author's careful explanation of the tangle of legal suits brought
                    forth in the 1950s through the Indian Claims Commission and the subsequent appeal to the federal
                    courts. Anson concludes that the Miamis' attitudes toward their past is quite secure. The 
                            Miami
                         Indians now furnishes readers that same security.

            Sixty-four documents and an elaborate introduction constitute this anthology of sources on 
                        France
                     in 
                        America
                     from 1534 to 1810. The documents are grouped in six sections: "Origins of 
                        New France
                    " (1534-1664), "The Royal Regime" (1662-1744),
                    "Intercolonial Rivalry" (1682-1713), "The French Empire at its
                    Height" (1713-1754), "The Fall of 
                        New France
                     " (1750-1760), and "Beginnings of British  Rule" (1763-1810). About half the material was written after
                    1690. Each document is prefaced by a brief explanatory note and a bibliography, and some have a note
                    on "further reading." They are almost entirely of French authorship, a few
                    English, none Spanish or Indian. Their character is official or quasiofficial: declarations,
                    patents, reports, petitions, acts, proclamations, instructions, and the like. They are thus legal,
                    administrative, diplomatic, economic, or social in content. No private correspondence, no Indian
                    folk tales, almost no literary, cultural, artistic, or personal records are included. Zoltvany has
                    drawn from a wide range of printed materials such as the Publications of the
                    Champlain Society, Jesuit Relations, Documents Relating to the Constitutional History
                        of 
                            Canada
                        , and Rapports de I'Archiviste de la Province de
                    Quebec as well as a considerable number of unpublished manuscripts. The texts are entirely in
                    English, many of them translated by the editor himself.
            
               The French Tradition in 
                            America
                        
                appears as a volume in the Documentary History of the 
                            United States
                        
                series. It deals almost exclusively with French 
                        Canada
                    ; it has very little on 
                        Louisiana
                    , almost nothing on 
                        Florida
                     or the West Indies. The French who came to British North America are not mentioned,
                    neither Paul Revere, James Bowdoin, John Jay, Oliver De Lancey, Eleuthère Du Pont, nor
                    Henry Laurens; neither is there any evidence of French cultural or intellectual elements in the 
                        United States
                    .
            How (and why) Europeans displaced Indians, and how the English overcame the French are questions not
                    answered here although much raw material for answers is present. Why after more than two centuries
                    of subordination the French in parts of North America have succeeded in reasserting their existence
                    is puzzling. The selections, fascinating in themselves, do not make evident the integrity,
                    intensity, impenetrability, and plenitude of the French tradition nor explain the appalling loss of
                    morale so impressive to American observers of the French settlements after 1780. What special
                    qualities enabled the French to form the carapace for the expansion of the
                    "Anglais" over the continent during the hundred years after 1759 ? Can their
                    astonishing accomplishments be compared in any way with the fate of the Puritans, Dutch, West
                    Africans, Hurons, and 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Germans?
            The material in this volume is well edited and well presented. It makes delightful reading. The
                    introduction is thoughtful and informative. If the volume lacks a point of view or a purpose, the
                    lack may be ascribed to the general editorial plan. There are almost no footnotes, and most
                    regrettably there is no index.

               The Slave Catchers: Enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law, 1850-1860. By
                    Stanley W. Campbell. (

                     Press, 1970. Pp. viii, 236. Notes, appendix, bibliography, index. $8.00.)
            
               
                        Campbell
                     has written a useful book which demolishes some well worn cliches about the 1850s. A
                    number of historians have repeated the assertion, rooted in the work of James Ford Rhodes, that the
                    Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 aroused such disapproval in the North that the law was virtually
                    unenforceable. The Slave Catchers effectively challenges this contention.
            Before 1854, 
                        Campbell
                     contends, northern public opinion was badly divided, with a majority willing to abide
                    by the law. A general fear of disunion, strong pressure from businessmen and the clergy counseling
                    obedience, and acceptance of the Compromise of 1850 by both major parties were important factors in
                    inducing northern acquiescence in the return of escaped slaves. After 1854 northern public opinion
                    increasingly condemned the Fugitive Slave Law. Campbell's discussion of public opinion
                    reveals little that is new, and his assertions about the majority of northerners, "the bulk
                    of the population residing in the free states" (p. 48), and the like are lacking evidence.
                    His evidence of the role of clergymen and businessmen in the North seems thinly grounded. Still, 
                        Campbell
                    's point that northern public opinion was neither unanimous nor decisive in its
                    impact on the enforcement of the act seems correct.
            The important contribution of this book lies in its discussion of enforcement of the Fugitive Slave
                    Law. Campbell shows that Presidents Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, and James Buchanan vigorously
                    supported the law. He further demonstrates that personal liberty laws, by which, in effect, northern
                    states refused assistance to federal authorities, had little effect on the willingness or ability of
                    the federal courts and marshals to remand slaves. He points out that of 191 slaves claimed in the
                    federal courts under the act, 157 or 82.2 per cent were returned to their owners. There was no
                    slackening of enforcement after 1854, except in 
                  New England, Wisconsin
               , and 
                        Michigan
                    , despite the apparent shift in public opinion. Moreover, 141 slaves were returned to
                    the Fouth without due process. Of the 332 cases cited by Campbell only 22 slaves were rescued by
                    abolitionists. In short, the Fugitive Slave Law was strongly enforced.
            But was it effective? 
                        Campbell
                     says it was useless as a deterrent : thousands ecaped in the 1850s, but few returns
                    were made. It provided abolitionists with propaganda so powerful that southerners were convinced
                    that the law was unenforced. One wishes that 
                        Campbell
                     had developed the latter theme. His treatment of the significance  of the Fugitive Slave Law in deepening sectional hatreds and justifying
                    the southern revolt is too brief. This caveat, however, cannot detract from the value of 
                        Campbell
                    's findings: this is a good piece of research which must alter our treatment of
                    the Fugitive Slave Law.

               North of Reconstruction: 
                            Ohio
                         Politics, 1865-1870. By Felice A. Bonadio. (
                        New York
                    : 
                        New York
                     University Press, 1970. Pp. xi, 204. Notes, index. $8.95.)
            Felice Bonadio's carefully documented monograph is an important addition both to 
                        Ohio
                     history and to Reconstruction historiography. He finds that the issues which dominated
                    northern political dialogue during the five years following the Civil War were the questions
                    concerning southern reconstruction and Negro rights. By concluding that the direction of national
                    politics and policies are often determined by local circumstances and issues, Bonadio follows the
                    course set recently by Michael F. Holt's Forging A Majority (1969) and
                    Paul Kleppner's The Cross of Culture (1970). Bonadio maintains that a
                    true understanding of national history depends upon a knowledge of what was taking place at the
                    state and community level.
            The major theme developed in North of Reconstruction is that 
                        Ohio
                    's political leaders were less concerned with a sincere discussion of the
                    issues of southern reconstruction and Negro rights than historians have commonly assumed. As Holt
                    found in 
                        Pittsburgh
                     during the 1850s, Bonadio finds in 
                        Ohio
                     in the 1860s that ideology had little place in the political struggle of the period.
                    Bonadio questions the validity of the thesis of John and La Wanda Cox' study, Politics, Principle and Prejudice (1963). He agrees that the Democrats made political
                    capital by playing on prejudice, but he sees little of idealism and principle in the action and
                    measures of the Republican party, especially in 
                        Ohio
                    .
            Factional struggles plagued the Republican party in 
                        Ohio
                     after the war, and the national issues were used for local advantages by factions
                    within the party as a means of gaining control for selfish purposes or to split the party in order
                    to create a new alignment which would make use of seceders from the Democratic party. Political
                    bartering, jobbery, and plunder were the order of the day, and President Andrew Johnson played a
                    less dominant role in distributing patronage in 
                        Ohio
                     than historians have generally assumed.
            On the one hand Bonadio challenges the theories of Charles A. Beard and Howard K. Beale, who argued
                    that military reconstruction  was the result of a plot by
                    northern businessmen eager to keep the South out of the 
                        Union
                     until the business community had established an economic system which would benefit its
                    own class. On the other hand he rejects the positions taken by Eric McKitrick and the Coxes that
                    Johnson was to blame for the military reconstruction because of his selfish political objectives
                    which alienated the Republican moderates and caused them to join the radicals in imposing a harsh
                    settlement. "The program of military reconstruction," insists Bonadio,
                    "was the expedient hit upon by the new Republicans … who wanted to preserve
                    their party's national supremacy by keeping the South impotent as long as
                    possible" (p. 52). In 
                        Ohio
                     time was needed to secure party harmony and unity.
            Bonadio's study is weakened by his failure to look beyond an analysis of the stated motives
                    of political leaders. Since politicians talk political expediency and patronage to each other, by
                    concentrating on an examination of intraparty correspondence Bonadio does not explore the mixed
                    motives of politicians and does not reveal the influence of the larger constituency. Before the
                    reconstruction issues can be pronounced a sham platform, there is a need for a comprehensive
                    examination of other sources, such as religious, political, labor, and business records and
                    journals.
            The most significant contribution of Bonadio's study is the thorough and revealing analysis
                    that he gives of the intraparty strife, third party tendencies, and lack of cohesion in the
                    Republican party of 
                        Ohio
                     during the 1860s.

            Clyde C. Walton, former executive director of the 
                        Illinois
                     State Historical Society, has compiled twenty-five essays for this sesquicentennial
                    volume on the history of his native state. The articles were taken exclusively from the periodical
                    publications of the society and their impact is impressive. If anyone has forgotten the names of the
                    distinguished scholars who were interested in the history of 
                        Illinois
                    , the table of contents will serve as an excellent reminder. James Alton James, Benjamin
                    P. Thomas, Ray A. Billington, Paul W. Gates, David Donald, and Allan Nevins head the imposing list.
            Walton has organized An 
                            Illinois
                         Reader along chronological lines. Five sections, each roughly eighty pages in
                    length, treat sequentially with five periods: the prestatehood, the frontier state, the  Lincoln, the emerging industrial, and the recent. This chronological
                    balance is sound, and the mix of essays–social, political, biographical, and
                    economic–within each section is excellent. Walton has identified each author and provided
                    an ample and interesting introduction for each of the periods. He has also included some useful
                    maps.
            Walton selected essays that he liked and that he thought would be of interest to adult readers. He
                    was successful. This reviewer discovered the essays to be as fresh in the rereading as they were
                    when he read them for the first time. These essays have style and pungency. Here is Allan Nevins
                    telling about Lincoln and Lorado Taft; Ray A. Billington describing "starry-eyed
                    speculators"; David Donald noting that "few Negroes have written books about their
                    great emancipator" (p. 255); Harvey Wish explaining John P. Altgeld's pardon of
                    the 
                        Chicago
                     anarchists; and Walter Trohan recounting his life with the owner and publisher of the 
                        Chicago
                    
                    Tribune, Colonel Robert R. McCormick. But each essay offers its reader fascinating
                    fare, and anyone interested in the history of 
                        Illinois
                     and the Middle West will find this book a worthwhile addition to his library.

            This first of two volumes for 
                        Wisconsin
                     marks the resumption of publication of The Territorial Papers of the 
                            United States
                        
                now under the editorship of John Porter Bloom. In three parts this volume
                    contains a representative selection of documents from the period January to June, 1836, preceding
                    the creation of the 
                        Wisconsin
                     Territory, the Executive Journal of the territory from 1836 to 1848, and selected
                    papers from the first administration of Governor Henry Dodge from 1836 to 1839. Bloom is generous in
                    his acknowledgements to his predecessor, Clarence E. Carter, who before his death in 1961 had edited
                    the previous twenty-six volumes and done much of the preliminary work on the 
                        Wisconsin
                     volumes. But credit for the remarkable achievement of this volume must belong to Bloom
                    and his staff, for they had to proceed knowing that simultaneously with the publication of this
                    volume there would be released one hundred sixteen microfilm reels containing
                    "substantially" all the 
                        Wisconsin
                     territorial records now in the National Archives.
            One can hardly avoid asking why a small proportion of the 
                    records should be issued in printed form when the microfilm series is so readily available. Leaving
                    aside the greater cost and difficulty of using the records on microfilm, much of the answer to that
                    question resides in the superb editorial work which is one of the triumphs of this volume. Very few
                    users of microfilm command the supplementary information in the form of identifications, citations,
                    and other data providing a context for the documents that is contained in this volume's
                    brief and unobtrusive footnotes. The editing is not perfect–something no reviewer or
                    reader should reasonably expect. There are a few minor errors in the otherwise magnificent index of
                    nearly two hundred pages. Occasionally one would have liked a footnote giving the outcome or result
                    implied in a few of the documents which appear to be left hanging. But these errors and omissions
                    are insignificant in comparison with the compact wealth of information which will make this volume a
                    pleasure for scholars to use; they also in no way challenge the sound and sensitive judgment that
                    has produced such a balanced selection of documents.
            A more surprising part of the answer lies in the literary quality of the volume. Ordinarily nobody
                    except reviewers is expected to read a book of documents from cover to cover. This volume is an
                    exception to the rule, and readers who do read the book through should be delighted with the result.
                    Much of the interest revolves around the two dominant figures of territorial 
                        Wisconsin
                    , Henry Dodge and James Doty, whose contrasting political attitudes and styles emerge so
                    distinctly from these documents. Back of them are a fascinating array of individuals, ranging in
                    temperament and activity from precisely formal military officers to zealously reform minded Indian
                    agents. Whether they intended to or not, Bloom and his associates have in fact selected a sequence
                    of documents which in the variety of situations and personalities portrayed and in the pacing of
                    events over a relatively few years produces what can be described in simple words as just plain good
                    reading.
            This volume is convincing evidence that renewed publication of The Territorial Papers of
                        the 
                            United States
                        
                will produce volumes fully equal in quality and interest to their distingushed
                    predecessors.

            Professor Nelli's analysis of the role of Italians in 
                        Chicago
                     makes  a monumental contribution to the
                    understanding of immigrant communities and the process of their assimilation into American life.
                    This book, in exhaustive detail, investigates every aspect of Italian immigrant life in 
                        Chicago
                     from the origins of the immigrants in the old country to the flight of their
                    assimilated children to the suburbs. Without a doubt this volume is the most thorough treatment of
                    the subject available.
            In tracing the origins of Italians who settled in 
                        Chicago
                    , in analyzing their settlement patterns once in the 
                        United States
                     and particularly in 
                        Chicago
                    , in reconstructing their economic activities and political behavior, in dissecting the
                    relationship between Italians and crime, and in describing the role of community institutions in the
                    process of assimilating Nelli has touched on practically every important aspect of immigrant life.
                    What makes this tour de force even more impressive is the solid and exhaustive research on which it
                    is based. The ample complement of maps and tables alone gives graphic testimony to the thoroughness
                    and imaginativeness of Nelli's methodology.
            Yet the sheer quantity of information, the vast array of facts and statistics should not obscure the
                    new interpretations coming from this study. Ethnic neighborhoods, in 
                        Chicago
                     at any rate, had none of the rigidity and cohesiveness that immigrant folklore would
                    give them. Indeed, residential mobility turns out to be a major characteristic of Italian settlement
                    patterns. Equally interesting is Nelli's description of Italian crime. While showing the
                    independence of American Italian crime from control or indeed any substantial links with old world
                    organizations, he also illustrates how crime helped Italians assimilate. "The
                    'syndicate' required the repression of lingering old-world prejudices against
                    fellow members from other provinces or countries. … Because of its function as a means of
                    economic betterment and social mobility, crime occupied a place in the acculturation of Italians in
                    the 
                        United States
                    , along with immigrant-community institutions, education, the padrone system, and
                    politics" (p. 155).
            While this study will surely become required reading for all those interested in immigration history,
                    it does present some difficulties. Its major failing stems from the sheer quantity of material
                    accumulated and compiled by the author. This is a hard book to read. Events, illustrations,
                    statistics, and analysis follow one upon the other with little time out for reflection or summation.
                    Time and again the reader looks in vain for a pause for perspective. Each chapter, it is true, ends
                    with a summing up, but these small summaries do not add up to the interpretive overview that would
                    give this book a cohesiveness it  now lacks. But despite this
                    weakness Nelli has produced a first rate study.

            Richard Rhodes' Middle West is a sweep of the American earth from the 
                        St. Louis
                     arch to the eastern border of 
                        Colorado
                    . It includes, principally, the states of 
                        Missouri
                     and 
                        Kansas
                    , where he was born and grew up and to which he has recently returned after an education
                    at Yale University, a brief stint on the staff of Newsweek magazine, and a tour of
                    duty with the Air Force.
            In an introductory chapter recalling his boyhood on a farm near Independence, 
                        Missouri
                    , the author explains that succeeding chapters will discuss many different subjects but
                    will, in the end, "come together to demonstrate something of the region, this place or
                    these places, this inland ground" (p. 10).
            The book is what the subtitle promises: an evocation. Short on historical background, it treats the
                    "forbears" of the region with three pages about Thomas Jefferson, who
                    "shaped the inland ground," and with somewhat longer passages about Josiah Gregg,
                    who published a book of his travels as bookkeeper for a Santa Fe trader in 1844; Henry Chatillon,
                    Francis Parkman's guide; William Hornaday, who reported on the vanishing buffalo herd to
                    the Smithsonian Institution in the 1880s; and a 
                        Nebraska
                     settler's wife named Mollie Sanford, who kept a diary in the 1850s. Nothing
                    more.

               Inland Ground is an uneven book. On the subjects of wheat, coyote hunting, hog
                    butchering, Truman, and Eisenhower Rhodes is poetic. At other times, as in his chapters on Wadsworth
                    and Masters and Johnson, he hardly rises above the journalistic level of the Sunday  supplements of provincial newspapers. But in the end the book does
                    "come together to demonstrate something of the region … this inland
                    ground."

               The Lure of the Land: A Social History of the Public Lands from the Articles of
                        Confederation to the New Deal. By Everett Dick. (Lincoln: University of 
                        Nebraska

            The objective of this latest history of the public domain is to trace the process by which ownership
                    of land was transferred from the government to private hands. Everett Dick has oriented his study
                    around the accepted thesis that a great difference in viewpoint separated the law givers in the East
                    from the land users in the West. This difference in attitude towards the land decreed that the
                    nation "was a house divided against itself" from the very beginning of the
                    westward movement. That the nation was not rent asunder over this division, Dick maintains, was due
                    to the fluidity of the frontier–the process by which "new settlers gradually
                    became old settlers and their attitude and thinking gradually became more eastern, yet they retained
                    a measure of the western outlook" (p. 350). Given the present ecological crisis which is
                    the result of the continuing mismanagement and exploitation of the natural environment, most readers
                    will find it rather difficult to accept Dick's conclusion that the western viewpoint
                    "vanished" with the closing of the frontier.
            In developing this theme the author has largely plowed old ground in relating the story of the
                    attempts of the pioneers to satisfy their hunger for land–either with the aid of federal
                    laws or, more usually, in spite of them. Dick's effort is commendable for focusing more
                    than most other accounts on the role of the farmer-settlers as speculators and "land
                    hoggers." Furthermore, he raises the central question of "what per cent of the
                    land was subject to these practices" but he unfortunately dismisses it as
                    "difficult to determine" (p. 364). With all due respect for Dick's very
                    significant contributions to our understanding of western history, it must be pointed out that if
                    the question of "how much" is to be answered at all, it will be through the
                    techniques of quantification that recent students have brought to the problem–techniques
                    and results which are unfortunately ignored in this traditionally oriented descriptive history.

            The Wallaces of 
                        Iowa
                     have provided public leaders of their state and the nation for three generations.
                    "Uncle 
                        Henry
                    " Wallace was a prominent clergyman and publisher of a popular farm journal.
                    His son, Henry C. Wallace, was briefly a faculty member of 
                        Iowa
                     State College, continued his father's journalistic interests as editor of Wallaces' Farmer, and served as secretary of agriculture under President
                    Warren G. Harding. In turn, his son, Henry Agard Wallace, continued the publication of the family
                    magazine, helped to implement the New Deal as secretary of agriculture under Franklin D. Roosevelt,
                    and served four years as vice president of the 
                        United States
                    . All three Wallaces exhibited a strong streak of stubbornness, considerable leadership
                    ability, and a continuing devotion to farming and to agricultural economics. Not the least able of
                    the family, Henry C. Wallace faced an America in transition and American agriculture in deep crisis.
                    This study of his relatively brief career in the presidential Cabinet adds a new dimension to
                    present knowledge of the twenties.
            Using a considerable variety of manuscript and printed sources, periodicals, and interviews, plus the
                    standard secondary accounts, Donald L. Winters has produced a well written and informative book. Not
                    intended as a full length biography, the study traces the family background and early life of the
                    second generation Wallace but concentrates on the four years which he served as secretary of
                    agriculture. Wallace fought successfully to prevent Secretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall from
                    securing the transfer of the 
                        United States
                     Forest Service to the Interior Department. He promoted the Packers and Stockyard Act
                    and supported the passage of the farm credits law. He was a leader in the losing battle for the
                    enactment of the McNary-Haugen Bill. Through much of his tenure Wallace carried on a continuing feud
                    with Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover which dated back to the food administration during World
                    War I. Though he, no doubt, would have retired from the Calvin Coolidge Cabinet at the end of his
                    first term, Wallace's sudden death in October, 1924, cut short his career. His efforts to
                    end the agricultural depression were unavailing, but any more comprehensive program of farm aid
                    would not have been possible in the twenties.
            Although Wallace had been an admirer of Theodore Roosevelt, he was not really a Progressive. As
                    secretary his contacts with such leading western Progressives as Robert La Follette, George Norris,
                    and William E. Borah were not close, and Winters leaves their relationship unclear. The volume could
                    also have profited by the inclusion  of illustrations and a more
                    comprehensive index. These, however, are merely minor criticisms of an excellent book. It is a
                    welcome addition to the literature of the Harding era.

               The Irreconcilables: The Fight Against the League of Nations. By Ralph Stone. (
                        Lexington
                    : The University Press of 
                        Kentucky
                    , 1970. Pp. 208. Notes, appendix, bibliographical essay, index. $9.95.)
            The irreconcilables are often depicted as having been the victors in the Senate struggle over the
                    Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations in 1919 and 1920. In the sense that they achieved
                    their goal of keeping the 
                        United States
                     out of the League, they were victorious; but, as Ralph Stone clearly points out, they
                    were not mere negativists nor motivated by only personal or political gain. Their reasons for
                    opposing the treaty as harmful to the interests of the 
                        United States
                    – or of mankind–were based on principle, although the principles
                    were likely to be quite diverse when one considers the irreconcilables individually. Within the
                    battalion of death were "conservatives and liberals, pacifists and militarists,
                    imperialists and anti-imperialists, isolationists and internationalists … more a cross
                    section of the nation than an ideologically homogeneous minority" (p. 178).
            Early in the treaty fight the irreconcilables took the initiative and maintained it throughout most
                    of the struggle, ever keeping their views before the Senate and the public and making most effective
                    the influence they had. But there were, even at the end, only sixteen bitter enders. How could they
                    have achieved their goal when they constituted only one sixth of the Senate? Stone sees, first, the
                    importance of the talents of the irreconcilables themselves, among whom were "several of
                    the outstanding senators of the twentieth century" (p. 2). Second, the political situation
                    played into their hands. The Republicans in the 1918 election had won control of the Senate by the
                    barest margin; the new majority leader, 
                        Henry
                     Cabot Lodge, by virtue of his office if nothing else, was much concerned with party
                    unity and was sensitive to pressure. Third, there was Democratic inflexibility. President Woodrow
                    Wilson and most bitter enders desired a forthright vote on the treaty as written at 
                        Paris
                    . Wilson, with encouragement from the irreconcilables, refused to change his goal; but
                    the bitter enders, who recognized that they needed Lodge as much as he needed them, yielded to
                    political necessity and, for the moment at  least, supported the
                    reservation method of bringing the treaty to a vote.
            Stone has provided a thoroughly and widely researched work, one which is a welcome corrective to the
                    view of the irreconcilables as a homogeneous group of traditionalist isolationists. The
                    author's style is smooth and his point of view clearly explained. Although Stone at times
                    yields to the temptation to list the reactions of individual irreconcilables to a particular event,
                    it is hard to see, in light of the author's goals, how such exposition is altogether to be
                    avoided. The Irreconcilables may not be popular fare for beginning history
                    students, but it is essential for anyone seeking an understanding of the almost incredibly complex
                    struggle over the part in world affairs to be taken by the 
                        United States
                     after the First World War. It is instructive also in helping to understand similar
                    discussions in more recent years.

            In this book, based upon extensive research in American, British, and Canadian archives, Professor
                    Buckley has emphasized the three major agreements resulting from the 
                        Washington
                     Conference of 1921-1922: the Four Power Treaty, the Five Power Treaty, and the Nine
                    Power Treaty. In developing his account Buckley includes the essential background information needed
                    to understand the conference. He describes, for example, the anti-Japanese feeling prevalent in the
                    Department of State and analyzes the American desire to break up the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and
                    replace it with a new naval arrangement in the Pacific.
            Buckley is very good in showing how the conference actually operated. He analyzes the consultations
                    and the compromises by Great Britain, 
                        Japan
                    , and the 
                        United States
                     that finally led to the three most important treaties, showing how the powers'
                    diplomatic, strategic, and economic positions affected their moves in the bargaining. Furthermore,
                    his presentation of the technical aspects of the conference is so lucid that a layman would have no
                    difficulty in grasping what went on.
            In contrast to a number of other historians who have written on the 
                        Washington
                     Conference, Buckley believes that Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes approached
                    the negotiations realistically; he  went into the meetings with
                    limited goals and in the main achieved them. Having objectively assessed the national interests of
                    the 
                        United States
                    , Hughes took an important step toward a new Asian policy designed to defend those
                    interests and thereby gave the 
                        United States
                     an opportunity to improve its position in the Far East. If later administrations failed
                    to follow up his policy, one cannot fault the secretary. This reviewer feels that, on the whole,
                    Buckley has presented a convincing case.

                    The establishment of an annual lecture series concerning Indiana history was a milestone of
                    importance achieved by the Indiana Historical Society during 1969-1970. The three addresses here
                    published are: "Redcoats and Red Men: The Development of American Military
                    Confidence," by Howard H. Peckham; "The Transformation of Republican Thought,

                    America," by Harry L. Coles. This volume affords testimony to the fact that such a lecture
                    series can be of interest and value to both scholars and general readers.

                    $17.50.) Originally published in 1929, this volume contains official records pertaining
                    to the case of Ex parte Milligan (1866). The record in the Supreme Court,
                    arguments for the petitioner and the 
                        United States
                    , and the order and opinions of the court are allegedly taken from official sources in
                    the Library of Congress or the published papers of the men involved. Also included are the
                    proceedings of the military commission by which Lambdin P. Milligan of 
                        Huntington
                    , Indiana, was sentenced to hang as a traitor and the decision handed down in Ex parte Merryman, a case similar to the Milligan trial. In a lengthy introduction
                    Klaus details the background of Milligan's arrest, trial by military commission, and
                    eventual vindication by the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, although his introduction contains much
                    interesting and informative material, the editor's many assertions and conclusions are
                    generally unsupported by documentary evidence. Many of his statements are based on rather unreliable
                    sources and are, to say the least, questionable. Nevertheless, as stated in the Introduction to the
                    series in which this book was originally published, "It is a characteristic of American
                    life that its crises, its intimacies, its colour, pathos, humour and drama, and its insipidities,
                    are laid bare and probed, even brought on and managed, in the courts of law." Thus it is
                    valuable to have reprinted this account of one of the earliest and most famous cases in defense of
                    civil liberty. Lorna Lutes Sylvester, Indiana University,

                    $4.95.) In 1970 Hoosier Heritage Press of 
                        Indianapolis
                     reprinted this volume of Cox' reminiscences. Added to the original account of
                    settlement along the upper 
                        Wabash
                     were a frontispiece, an introduction, and, most praiseworthy, an index. Many of
                    Cox' narratives were first published in the 
                        Lafayette
                    
                    Daily Courier in October and November, 1859, as a series called "Old
                    Settlers," and it is under this title that the work has been reissued. In the Introduction
                    to the reprint Alameda C. McCollough, of the 
                        Tippecanoe County
                     Historical Association, states: Old Settlers "is the genesis
                    of all that has since been written about this county [
                        Tippecanoe
                    ] in that era." This is indeed true both because of the book's
                    "reputable status in local history" and because it is delightful reading.
                    Cox' stories of the early settlers of 
                  Lafayette, Lagrange, Crawfordsville
               , and other towns, his descriptions  of the prairies and forests, his tales of pioneer amusements and work,
                    his accounts of the adventures of the Black Creek schoolmaster reveal the early settlers of northern
                    Indiana as do few other recollections. As McCollough says: this book "is a testimony of
                    contemporaries of Cox, who, like him, were involved in creating the shape of things to come. To them
                    these narratives were their voice and pen, and, in time, possession of copies became something of a
                    hallmark of identity with pioneer days." Thanks to the Hoosier Heritage Press Hoosiers can
                    once again experience this feeling of kinship with their ancestors. Lorna Lutes

                    largely an examination of the group and mass stages of immigration to

                     which took place from statehood in 1837 until the implementation of quotas in the
                    1920's" (p. ix). Vander Hill discusses briefly the contributions of Canadians,
                    Germans, Cornish, Irish, Dutch, Scandinavians, and the "new" immigrants of the
                    late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to

                    documented account provides an excellent introduction to the role of the immigrant in settling not
                    only the Wolverine State but the Great Lakes frontier as well. Lorna Lutes Sylvester, Indiana University,

               The Role of Libraries in the Cultural History of Indiana. By J. Robert Constantine.

                        Bloomington

                    loan.) In brief compass Constantine offers an overview of library development within Indiana with
                    emphasis on influences and considerations believed to have prevented libraries from having had as
                    large an impact as desirable upon the cultural achievements within the state. Constantine correctly
                    notes that "the libraries of the state have only rarely been adequately funded"
                    (p. 55). The reviewer readily concurs with this conclusion but regrets that Constantine did not
                    delve more deeply than he has into other factors which also need substantial and continuing emphasis
                    if libraries are to exercise, as they should, a greater role in Indiana's cultural life.
                    For instance, there surely is urgent and continuing need for larger library units, more resourceful
                    and effective library administration, better personnel policies, and  more attention to cultural subjects in courses required of persons
                    studying to be librarians.

                    statistical data sources, gazetteer, index. Paper-bound, $2.00.) Unfortunately the
                    previous review notice for this atlas (September, 1970) inadvertantly and incorrectly indicated that
                    it is a revision of one which originally appeared in 1966. Much useful information is offered in
                    this atlas which, according to a statement received from Professor Kingsbury, "represents
                    my attempt to produce the first modern thematic atlas of Indiana." Kingsbury expects to
                    publish a revision of his atlas once the necessary data has become available from the decennial
                    census for 1970. Individuals noting any possible errors or distortions in this atlas or having any
                    suggestions to offer regarding its proposed revision are invited to correspond with Professor Robert

               Revolutionary Soldiers Buried In Indiana (1949) With Supplement (1954). Compiled by
                    Margaret R. Waters. Reprint with added Table of Contents. (

                    : Genealogical Publishing Company, 1970. Pp. 42, 165. Indices. $15.00.) In
                    1938 the Daughters of the American Revolution published a Roster of Soldiers and
                        Patriots of the American Revolution Buried in Indiana under the editorship of Mrs. Roscoe
                    C. O'Byrne. This volume offers information concerning 1,394 such men. In 1949 Margaret R.
                    Waters published a volume entitled Revolutionary Soldiers Buried in Indiana
                    … Its subtitle indicates that it includes the names of 300 men not listed by
                    O'Byrne. Then in 1954 Waters published a second volume entitled Revolutionary
                        Soldiers Buried in Indiana: A Supplement …, the subtitle of which states that it
                    includes 485 men not previously noted in either of the earlier publications. The republication by
                    photo-offset process of the two volumes by Waters within the same cover should make them more
                    readily available to searchers after genealogical and historical items. Even though neither a
                    complete listing nor entirely accurate information is presumably ever attainable as regards all
                    patriots buried in Indiana who fought in the Revolution, persons interested in this topic will
                    remain indebted to both O'Byrne and Waters for their compilations.
                    O'Byrne's 1938 publication was republished in 1968 by the Genealogical Publishing
                    Company.

                    index. $10.95.) McDermott's Foreword to this volume clearly indicates the scope
                    and design of these thirteen papers, originally presented at a Conference on Travelers on the
                    Western Frontier, sponsored by Southern 
                        Illinois
                     University at Edwardsville in February, 1968. The papers in part seek to
                    "stimulate others to join in the investigation of the vast riches of travel literature that
                    await the historical scholar" (p. viii). Four papers discuss and describe major library
                    resources for the western frontier; four papers investigate frontier literature in nineteenth
                    century periodicals; other papers focus on the western riverman, reports on the Indian, writings of
                    Jean Louis Berlandier, diaries of Missouri River travelers, and the roads west
                    from 
                        St. Louis
                     that travelers could have used. Documentation is generally full, indicating often the
                    wealth of material not used as well as included. The maps and other illustrations are quite
                    appropriate, and reproduction is good. The authors of these papers are enthusiastic about their
                    subjects and competent scholars; both characteristics mark the papers and make the reading of this
                    book an exciting venture. Most of all these papers are convincing proof that the investigation they
                    are trying to stimulate will in turn be exciting and rewarding. Pamela J. Bennett,

                    Riedel served the 
                        United States
                     Senate for almost a half century, starting as a page in 1918 and retiring as its press
                    liaison in 1965. This volume presents his personal recollections of men, episodes, and developments.
                    The spotty nature of the coverage is suggested by the fact that the index includes references to
                    Indiana Senators Birch E. Bayh, Homer E. Capehart, Frederick Van Nuys, and James E. Watson, but not
                    to such senators as Vance Hartke, William E. Jenner, Sherman Minton, Arthur R. Robinson, and Raymond
                    E. Willis. Among those mentioned, Watson receives the most attention. He is pictured as an extremely
                    conservative but most genial politician.

                    experienced, believed, projected" (p. xxi). In addition, Whitlock's autobiography
                    describes life in the Midwest during the early years of the twentieth century; it is consummate
                    prose, and if it is not already, it should be "a permanent work in … [American]
