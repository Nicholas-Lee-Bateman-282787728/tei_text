                    Hohenberger is probably best known for his studies of the <placeName>

                    Chris and Felix Brummett, Ellen Petro, and their friends and neighbors had their pictures taken by
                    "Hoh" on many occasions. Often they were posed; sometimes not. Frequently the
                    portraits were made at the request of the subject; at other times the photographer himself requested
                    a "sitting." Hohenberger might at one point complain in his diary that a person
                    "would be justified in giving up portraiture as your patrons pay you to lie,"<hi rend="sup">13</hi> but he recognized the potential and the appeal of this type of photography.
                    "I can look back with a good laugh at the time when I didn't want the natives to
                    bother me with making their portraits," he wrote. "I told them they would be
                    $5 a dozen and thought the ‘big’ price would keep them

                    what they wanted should not be considered in every instance, but he could also write:
                    "Photograph the old things which are fast disappearing. … When you picture
                    something that takes the observer back to boyhood days on the farm, you have hit the vital spot in

            <p>Hohenberger's first sales, he told one reporter, were to tourists who saw the pictures

                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Success really began, however, when several of his photographs were published in the

                    throughout the world. By 1920 some of his photographs were selling for as much as $25.00
                        each,<hi rend="sup">21</hi> and by 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, Hohenberger was

                    equipment and experimenting. He was always experimenting, he said, always learning something new,
                    because he really did not know very much about photography, at least not in the scientific way.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

                    just recording a person's appearance. He found his subjects in particular situations and

                    after entry in his diary he describes such techniques as hand coloring, time exposures, developing

                    admonitions to shoot pictures against the sun to get "beauteous" effects
                    "not otherwise obtainable"<hi rend="sup">24</hi> to technical instructions for

                    from elevations. Use anastigmat lenses. … Com. Ortho film. … Long bulb

                    He was incensed when, early in his career, he was called to <placeName>

                        averred.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hohenberger also carried on a running feud with his artist friends concerning the relative merits of
                    photography and painting. He frequently became defensive in his assertions that picture taking, too,
                    was an art, and sarcasm surfaced when he wrote: "Folks say to me ‘I wish I could
                    make as nice pictures as you do.’ Why, it's easy, according to artists. Just
                    like a mechanical toy—you wind it up and it does the rest."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> That artists admitted their inability to paint snow as wet as he could photograph it
                    pleased him, and he usually included the comment in his lectures.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Hohenberger

                    have argued the point—as an outsider, an observer who did not really
                    "belong." In a sense he "used" the natives in his work, and in
                    his writing he poked fun—albeit kindly—at their foibles. That they recognized

                    Moore and Lee Bright did the work on the wagon. Others assisted at the sawmill where the barrels
                    were rolled up steep planks and the contents emptied into the tank on wheels. The same was pulled
                    through the streets with the highway truck. It oozed all over the crossing and at my place someone
                    had placed dock leaves for stepping stones. Calamity howlers and bench lizards at the court house
                    said it was a mistake to put sawdust on the oil for when it rained it would wash away. And if it
                    finally dried out the wind would blow it away. Hershel Mobley said it was a devil of a note to put
                    oil on the streets to keep the dust down and then cover the oil with dust. The job cost about
                    $325, donated by citizens" [p. 334].</p>

            <p>In 1916 Indiana celebrated the centennial of its statehood. There is always something significant in
                    anniversaries, but for Hoosiers this occasion held special meaning. Individually and collectively
                    they were proud of their state's hundred year growth as well as Indiana's
                    achievements in agriculture, industry, politics, education, literature, and the arts.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> And Samuel M. Ralston, the state's centennial governor, was determined that

            </p>
            <p>Ralston was elected the twenty-seventh governor of Indiana in 1912 after waging a fierce campaign
                    against Albert J. Beveridge, the Progressive party's well known nominee, and against
                    Winfield T. Durbin, the Republican candidate. A competent lawyer and loyal Democrat, Ralston was a
                    modest man who throughout the campaign of 1912 exhibited a strong sense of decency and dedication.
                    Even more important, he was attuned to the spirit of the times. Believing that Indianians were
                    "conservatively progressive," Ralston made a moderate but successful appeal to the
                    voters' <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Ralston, who was born in 1856, had witnessed the transformation of the <placeName>

                    And he, like so many of his contemporaries who exercised political leadership in the early twentieth
                    century, was disturbed by the rapidity and complexity of this change and was anxious about the
                    future of traditional American values and institutions. Ralston was deeply attached to the old
                    social, political, and economic order which had allowed him to advance in both law and politics. But
                    he was not a reactionary who clung obstinately to the past; he realized that unbending resistance in
                    the face of massive change would only be self defeating. As governor, therefore, he not only took
                    the initiative in forwarding a variety of programs which brought Indiana into the forefront among
                    other progressive states, but he served Hoosiers in a manner of which they could be proud as they
                    celebrated their state's hundred year anniversary.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the sixty-ninth session of the legislature convened on January 7, 1915, Ralston reported on the
                    affairs of state in a message more somber than that delivered before the previous session of the

                        concerning Indiana's centennial observance. Finally, a provision was made to
                        appropriate $2,000,000 for a memorial building that would house a state library and
                        other state agencies. In the regular fall election in 1914 this proposal was rejected by the
                        voters. Indiana, <hi rend="i">Laws</hi> (1913), 526–28; <hi rend="i">Biennial Report

                        because the people were hostile "to a proper celebration of that historic
                        event" but because they objected "to the amount of money sought to be
                        appropriated therefor." Indiana, <hi rend="i">House Journal</hi> (1915), 53.</item>

            <p>In response to Ralston's directives both houses voted unanimously to create a nonsalaried,
                    nonpartisan historical commission and to appropriate $25,000 for its use. The governor;
                    James A. Woodburn, professor of American history and politics and director of the Indiana Historical
                    Survey at Indiana University; and Harlow Lindley, director of the Department of Indiana History and

                    homecoming celebration. And as a salute to the state's agricultural and industrial
                    diversity, Ralston proclaimed February 22, 1916, "Indiana Products Day." Banquets
                    and dinners were held in various towns and cities, at which nothing but products grown or
                    manufactured in the state were supposed to be served.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>Although the commissioners encouraged projects all over the state, they were determined that
                    Indiana's one hundredth anniversary would not be "marred by the presence of
                    anything of a cheap and tawdry nature." They warned county chairmen that the centennial
                    celebration was not a "carnival,"<hi rend="sup">11</hi> and when it became clear
                    that the National Patriotic League—a commercial enterprise supposedly emanating from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D. C.—was "masquerading under the guise of patriotism,"
                    it was publicly denounced. Speaking as president of the commission, Ralston declared that the league
                    had "no connection with the duly organized Indiana Historical Commission" and that
                    "all the work and arrangements of such ‘League’ or such persons is
                    hereby repudiated. …"<hi rend="sup">12</hi> The governor personally feared that
                    the National Patriotic League was attempting "to cripple materially the work of the

                    promoters can make some money."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> He was not mistaken. Before the
                    league's operation was halted, members of the commission were forced to issue several more

                    Commemorative songs and poems were written; markers were placed on historic highway trails; and

                    "Hoosiers in this the centennial year of their state should come to Corydon … to
                    recall something of the state's history … and to strengthen their love of and

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>—the man who would soon become Indiana's most prominent

                    before in which he had protested the removal of some magnificent trees to make way for a
                    thoroughfare. Smith sent for Lieber and told him of Strauss' request. Without a

            <p>Lieber, German born, came to Indiana in 1891, but he played no role in the state's
                    conservation movement until after 1910. His conversion to the conservation movement was hastened in
                    September, 1910, while visiting a friend, Fred Hetherington, at his cabin in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown county</region>
                    </placeName>. Lieber was astonished to find such scenic beauty so near to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and suggested that the "whole county ought to be bought up by the State and
                    then made into a State Park so that all of the people of Indiana could enjoy this beauty
                    spot." In February, 1911, Lieber purchased some land in <placeName>

            <p>Lieber called on Ralston in November, 1915, to discuss Indiana's centennial celebration and
                    the movement to save <placeName>

                    conversation, it is nearly certain that Lieber proposed "one solution" to end
                    "the destruction of the forests, the neglect of the historical places and the beauty spots
                    that mean health and happiness to its [Indiana's] people." Lieber's
                    "one solution" was to create a system of state parks as a permanent memorial of
                    the centennial celebration.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Ralston evidently voiced "no
                        objections."<hi rend="sup">30</hi> As a sign of his approval, the governor appointed

                    Commission met that same month, it passed a motion to inaugurate a system of state parks. Lieber
                    subsequently accepted the commission's invitation to serve as chairman of the newly created
                    state park memorial committee of which the <placeName>

            <p>To win support for a system of state parks Lieber and his colleagues initiated an impressive campaign
                    of education and persuasion. They first pointed out to Indiana citizens that the proposed park plan
                    was the only centennial plan that would memorialize the state as a whole in 1916. But more
                    important, they argued that a park system would be a worthwhile and dignified memorial. The
                    state's parks would "refresh and strengthen and renew tired people, and fit them
                    for the common round of daily life." No one, they asserted, could doubt the dignity of such
                    a plan. A comprehensive system of state parks, committee members urged, "would not only
                    memorialize the past but would build for the future. …" Indiana's parks
                    would "stand forever as a token of the past," and they would also "bring
                    health, wealth and happiness to our own generation and the many that will come after

                    money had to be raised by public subscription since the legislature had not appropriated funds for
                    that purpose. The Indiana Historical Commission and the state park memorial committee met jointly
                    and set the goal at $25,000. On April 12 Ralston issued a proclamation designating the
                    week of April 24 "an appropriate time" for giving subscriptions "to

            <p>In addition to giving birth to a system of state parks, Indiana's centennial celebration
                    stimulated interest in the good roads movement. The park committee noted that improved highways
                    would "naturally follow" the development of a system of state parks. Better roads,
                    the committee observed, "would soon bring these Parks into ready accessibility for people
                    even of modest means."<hi rend="sup">46</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much work needed to be done, however, before the park committee's predictions could be
                    realized, for Indiana in the early twentieth century lagged far behind other states in the area of
                    highway improvement. It had no department of highways nor did it have a uniform policy governing the
                    construction and maintenance of public roads. Because of this lack of organization Indiana on one
                    occasion did not share in funds appropriated by the federal government for the building of new
                        roads.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> As president of Indiana's Good Roads Association, Clarence
                    A. Kenyon reported in 1914: "each county and each township is a rule unto
                        itself."<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ralston was not unaware of these conditions. Yet, as governor of a state with a large farm
                    population, he faced stiff resistance to road reform. Many farmers, bound to a tradition of local
                    building and maintenance of roads, were reluctant to exchange their accustomed practices in favor of
                    a system that would require payment of all road taxes in money. A state financed highway program
                    suggested increased taxation and the loss of local control over roads, and the farmers refused to
                    accept either of these possibilities. They already felt overburdened with taxes, and in many
                    instances they considered the roads that led to and from their <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Rural residents had to be convinced that through a coordinated and comprehensive system of highway
                    supervision they too would benefit. In 1913, when the Hughes road bill advocating the creation of a
                    state highway department was before the house, road reformers argued that highway improvements
                    increased farm efficiency and lessened rural isolation.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> In a series of
                    conferences with legislative representatives from agricultural areas, Ralston also attempted to
                    assuage their fears and enlist their support,<hi rend="sup">51</hi> but "the country
                    members … were not to be whipped into line." The Hughes measure was

            <p>Ralston never accepted the legislature's verdict as final. This was hardly a surprise, for

                            president to come to Indiana. In one part Nicholson stated: "I beg to suggest, what

                            of appearing before a great host of Hoosiers of every political faith. If you do not accept

            <p>As the centennial highway celebration drew to a close, Ralston and Wilson certainly must have felt a

                    Highway neared completion in the fall of 1916. Two years earlier, in a letter to the Lincoln Highway
                    Association, Wilson had expressed his hope that in the not too distant future a highway, modeled
                    after the Lincoln Highway, might link the North and South together and make "the imaginary

                    governors—as well as numerous representatives of good roads associations and commercial

                    sent a telegram of congratulations "upon the inauguration … of the Dixie highway

                    In conclusion, he asserted that the Dixie Highway must be built, for only a completed road uniting

                    following Ralston's appointment of Fisher and Taggart to the board of directors of the

                    <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> issued a firm protest. Fearful that the new road would bypass <placeName>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">70</hi> Ralston, who was absolutely determined that nothing would
                    jeopardize the construction of "this great highway," refused to ignore the <hi rend="i">Tribune's</hi>, complaint. In a spirited statement Ralston reiterated his
                    feelings regarding the construction of the Dixie Highway and defended his appointment of Fisher and
                    Taggart. He contended that there was good reason why two <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> men were chosen: "it is conceded by all parties," he argued, that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> is "the one Indiana city that the road will certainly touch." And if
                    anyone doubted the capabilities of either man, the governor testified to their qualifications. He
                    recalled Fisher's experience as builder of the Lincoln Highway and Taggart's
                    service as chairman of a 1914 state highway commission appointed by Ralston to study road conditions
                    in Indiana. The governor maintained that both men were "well-poised, broad-gauged
                    businessmen, who have, in more than one instance, shown their willingness to surrender their
                    personal interests to the public welfare." In conclusion, he rebuked the <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> for its "premature criticisms" and asked rhetorically if it had
                    objected "to the Republicans, a few years ago, taking both <placeName>

                    Ralston, however, did not seem surprised. He had accurately judged the temper of the times. In 1915
                    and 1916 Indianians were exuberant with state pride, and they were not easily influenced by
                    arguments of a parochial or partisan nature.</p>
            <p>The Dixie Highway movement received warm support in other states as well. Thus, when the directors
                    met they decided "to run the road everywhere."<hi rend="sup">74</hi> Instead of

                    </placeName> to Miami, the highway association consented to the creation of two routes diverging and
                    coming together at various points along the way.<hi rend="sup">75</hi> Road construction was rapid;

            <p>Good roads, state parks, ceremonial pageants, memorial markers, and historical publications were all
                    inspired by an "outburst of patriotic interest in Indiana and its history." At the
                    year's end the county chairmen were asked what were "the most helpful and
                    permanent results" of the centennial celebration by the Indiana Historical Commission. They
                    responded that the state's hundredth year anniversary had awakened a sense of community

                    the property is a state memorial or that the historic district includes a state memorial; two
                    asterisks indicate that the site is designated as a National Historic Landmark; and three indicate
                    that the property is both. The date of acceptance is given in parentheses except for items

            <p>The Indiana Historical Bureau in recent years has maintained a most active and impressive publication
                    program. Many excellent books, including the five volume <hi rend="i">History of Indiana</hi>
                    currently underway in cooperation with the Indiana Historical Society, have appeared. In some
                    respects <hi rend="i">Progress After Statehood</hi> is a companion reader to the five volume set;
                    standing alone, it is a valuable and useful <hi rend="i">sampling</hi> of the raw materials of
                    nearly sixteen decades of Indiana history. The editors have combed a broad range of materials from
                    which to make their selections; the basic shortcomings are insufficient editorial introductions to
                    each of a dozen topical groupings and almost no textual explanations. The twelve introductions vary
                    in length from four lines to barely more than a page; the only footnotes in the book, with two or
                    three exceptions, identify selection sources.</p>
            <p>These sources, for the most part primary materials such as organizational proceedings, governmental
                    reports, newspaper articles and editorials, and the complete texts of a few significant state laws,
                    include a limited number of secondary accounts from historical journals and monographs. The broad
                    and well handled topics of "reform and reformers" and "transportation and
                    travel" are given the most extensive treatment; the shortest sections are on
                    "health and medicine," "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>," and "women," with some items in the latter two categories
                    discussing such recent developments as UNIGOV and the Equal Rights Amendment. The other topics
                    covered are agriculture, business, education, military affairs, natural resources (an especially
                    valuable section), Negroes, and politics. In some cases the selections seem happenstance; they are
                    not related to one another in developing themes; indeed, given the minimal editorial comment, some
                    passages raise as many questions as they answer. Yet the editors' purposes encompassed
                    illustrating the "vast resources available for Indiana history" (p. v), and in
                    this they have succeeded admirably.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most valuable items reprinted here, and certainly the most elusive, are newspaper
                    articles and editorials <pb n="275" id="VAA4025-071-3-075"/> revealing Indiana attitudes on issues
                    of the day such as free public schools, Negro rights, war and peace, and the Hoosier self image.
                    Although any reader could quarrel with some selections and regret the omission of
                    others—there is, for example, nothing on Indiana writers and artists, and the treatment
                    of both education and politics since the 1940s is disappointingly thin—it would be
                    difficult to improve upon them within the same space limitations.</p>
            <p>How can such a book be used? Obviously not suited for the secondary or even the college level
                    classroom as a supplementary text, the volume can nevertheless be consulted with profit by both
                    professional and lay students and by teachers of Indiana history. A helpful beginning point for
                    research into any of the twelve topics covered, the book may have its greatest use as a companion
                    volume to general state histories to give insight and particularity to material under discussion.
                        <hi rend="i">Progress After Statehood</hi> complements well but does not supplant the older <hi rend="i">Readings in Indiana History</hi> (1914), which emphasizes events prior to 1850, and
                    overall is a credit to its editors and publisher. Finally, given today's marketplace, the
                    book's moderate price makes it a genuine bargain.</p>

            <p>Teachers of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history have a wide variety of supplemental readings for their classes; most teachers
                    of state and local history have no such riches. Though the editors of these two volumes disclaim any
                    pretense of solving this problem for teachers of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan</settlement>
                    </placeName> history, they do attempt to "provide in convenient form a modest selection of
                    articles from a wide variety of sources" (Warner and Vander Hill, p. xi) on the history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan</settlement>
                    </placeName> from the Indian era to the present.</p>
            <pb n="276" id="VAA4025-071-3-076"/>
            <p>Of necessity, the readings in the two volumes are diverse and heterogeneous. Wisely, the editors
                    arrange the selections by topics within broad chronological periods. Yet, in an interpretive
                    foreword, Bruce Catton suggests an alternative pattern of organization for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan</settlement>
                    </placeName> history. Evoking boyhood memories, Catton writes of his beloved North Country, the area
                    north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bay City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which is "old, half empty, touched by the cold winds that drift down from the
                    Arctic, with trees and sand and crystal-clear water and drowsy small towns. …"
                    Only grudgingly does Catton acknowledge the existence of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> and other southern industrial centers, claiming that "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, after all, is not really <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan</settlement>
                    </placeName>" (May and Brinks, p. 6).</p>
            <p>Most selections in the two volumes are descriptions by contemporaries of Catton's
                    "two Michigans." In the early days <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan</settlement>
                    </placeName> was all North Country, the haunt of the Indians, fur traders, missionaries, and
                    soldiers. The French did little to transform this area, though French cultural influences lingered
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> into the twentieth century. Little development occurred during the short British
                    period, 1761 to 1796, a period marked by Indian conflict and the American Revolution. The
                    transformation of the North Country did not begin until the American phase of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan</settlement>
                    </placeName> history. The period prior to the Civil War encompassed frontier settlement and the
                    beginning of exploitation of such natural resources as timber, iron, copper, and fish.
                    Unfortunately, Edward Tiffin's famous, albeit inaccurate, report of 1815, which concluded
                    that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan</settlement>
                    </placeName> was not worth surveying, much less settling, is not included. Nor is there any
                    selection indicating the significance of the Erie Canal in the development of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The second volume describes such important features of the last third of the nineteenth century in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan</settlement>
                    </placeName> as the lumber industry, immigration, and the business oriented state government. Around
                    the turn of the century Governors Hazen Pingree and Chase Osborn helped <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan</settlement>
                    </placeName> politics escape from the domination of lumber barons and railroad men. Another
                    important theme in the second volume is the transformation of much of southern <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan</settlement>
                    </placeName> from North Country to industrial complex: the automobile industry originated early in
                    the twentieth century, and big labor organized some thirty years later. Thus arose the major forces
                        <pb n="277" id="VAA4025-071-3-077"/> that still influence economics and politics in the state.
                    The selections are particularly good in depicting the struggle between the United Automobile Workers
                    and the automobile companies in the sitdown strikes of the 1930s.</p>
            <p>In addition, the editors extensively, and honestly, portray social aspects of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan</settlement>
                    </placeName> which are as disparate as the Ku Klux Klan and "The Spirit of
                    Interlochen" by Van Cliburn. Perhaps farthest removed from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s North Country is the final selection; Malcom X's "Growing
                    Up in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan</settlement>

               <hi rend="i">Farming in the Midwest, 1840–1900</hi>, edited by James W. Whitaker, is a
                    compilation of papers presented at the Symposium on Midwest Agriculture, 1840–1900, and

                    the third in a series of such publications, having been preceded by <hi rend="i">The Structure of
                        the Cotton Economy of the Antebellum South</hi> (1970) and by <hi rend="i">Farming in the New

            <p>The papers included in the present volume were written by geographers, agronomists, and economists as
                    well as historians; and, as is to be expected in such a collection, they are of unequal merit and
                    interest. Some of the papers are only distantly related to farming in the Midwest; others appear to
                    be less significant than the accompanying remarks <pb n="278" id="VAA4025-071-3-078"/> of those who
                    commented upon them. And at least one paper contained enough undigested material to prompt the
                    commentator to ask: "What is the object of this historical study" (p. 199)?</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the volume does contain interesting and valuable essays which may be roughly divided
                    into five broad topics: the geographical aspects of historical farms and rural settlement; the work
                    of agricultural experiment stations in the Midwest; the private acquisition of land and tenant
                    farming in the area; the costs of midwestern farm making and the investments of foreign companies in
                    farm mortgages and land; and the farmers' relationship to commodity exchanges.</p>
            <p>Historians of the area will find interesting suggestions in Hildegaard Johnson's paper,
                    "A Historical Perspective on Form and Function in Upper Midwest Rural Settlement,"
                    and in John A. Jakle's comment on the paper in which the relationship between human value
                    systems and the appearance of the landscape is discussed. More intriguing, perhaps, is "A
                    Sample of Rural Households Selected from the 1860 Manuscript Censuses" by Fred Bateman and
                    James D. Foust. This essay, which contains a discussion of the compilation of the 1860 data on the
                    agricultural experience of 11,943 farms in twenty northern states both east and west,
                    "opens up" according to the authors, "completely new possibilities for
                    examining the character of the rural antebellum North" (p. 93). And, indeed, another paper
                    in the collection on "Farm-Making Costs in the 1850s," by Robert E. Ankli, has
                    already made use of the new material. Using the data compiled in the sample, Ankli attempts to
                    disprove the proposition, first advanced by Charles Danhof in 1941 and since generally accepted,
                    that it took $1,000 to build a farm on the western prairies.</p>
            <p>Paul Gates indicates what remains to be done in the study of the public domain in a paper entitled
                    "Research in the History of the Public Lands," and two papers, one by Donald
                    Winters and the other by Homer Socolofsky, deal with aspects of tenant farms in the Midwest.
                    Winters' paper discusses the variety of rental lease agreements made between tenants and
                    landlords and suggests that farm tenancy developed out of "rational economic
                    behavior" (p. 147) rather than from poorly conceived federal land policies as others have
                    held. In a less analytical paper Socolofsky traces <pb n="279" id="VAA4025-071-3-079"/> the land
                    holdings and the career of William Scully, one of the great landlords of the Midwest and a
                    fascinating character.</p>
            <p>Papers on the varieties of corn and wheat developed by midwestern agricultural stations and an

            <p>In the last paragraph of his introduction Bruce succinctly states what he is attempting to accomplish
                    in his book: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>This study begins with the context in which camp-meeting religion grew up and flowered:
                            first, with a description of plain-folk life and an interpretation of their place in the
                            Southern world; second, with an account of the Methodist and Baptist churches as Southern
                            institutions and of the camp-meeting as a practice. Once the context of camp-meeting
                            religion has been described, it then becomes possible to set out the contents of the
                            plain-folk religious belief system. To do this, there is an examination of the structure and
                            content of the camp-meeting and its relationship to the central purpose of Southern
                            evangelical religion, conversion. Then the study turns to the spiritual songs in order to
                            outline what most of those who were converted proclaimed their salvation to mean. Finally,
                            the study comes full circle to examine again the plain-folk and their lives, but at that
                            point to see what camp-meeting religion did for those who gave themselves over to it (p.
                            12).</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Generally, Bruce does a good job of accomplishing the goals which are outlined in his introduction.
                    His description of plain folk life and his interpretation of its role in the southern world is
                    generally accurate. However, considering the political activity of the plain folk which contributed
                    to the democratizing of southern state governments during the first <pb n="280" id="VAA4025-071-3-080"/> half of the nineteenth century, Bruce is on somewhat shaky ground when
                    he says: "they were nevertheless outside the political and economic processes of the
                    South" (p. 123).</p>
            <p>In describing the camp meeting and the conversion experience, Bruce gives one of the most thorough
                    and objective accounts that this reviewer has read. He also gives an in depth discussion of the
                    religious concepts which are present in the spiritual choruses. In the last chapter, in which Bruce
                    discusses the benefits which the frontier people derived from camp meetings, one especially receives
                    the impression that the author is very careful to give a detached appraisal.</p>
            <p>Overall, Bruce has made a significant contribution in his examination of the role of the camp meeting
                    experience in southern frontier life. Not only is the study historical, but it is sociological and
                    psychological as well. Except for the one point in interpretation noted above, this work is
                    impressive in its accuracy and comprehensiveness. <hi rend="i">And They All Sang Hallelujah</hi> is
                    the most compact, thorough, and objective study on the role and nature of the camp meeting on the
                    southern frontier that this reviewer has seen. Winner of the first James Mooney Award, sponsored by
                    the Southern Anthropological Society, this book would be a most valuable addition to all college and
                    secondary school libraries.</p>

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, this town grew so rapidly that it became, for a brief period, the largest city in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. It failed to survive as the center of the Mormon world, however. When revolutionary
                    doctrines of the Latter <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-071-3-081"/> Day Saints such as polygamy and the
                    political organization of the Mormon Kingdom of God were put into practice, they created a schism
                    within the Mormon community. This break in the unity of the group precipitated the destruction of
                    political and legal barriers which, until that time, had protected the Mormon metropolis from the
                    hostility of outsiders. Joseph Smith, the prophet, was murdered in 1844, and two years of guerrilla
                    warfare ensued. Faced with a renewal of general conflict, the Mormons abandoned Nauvoo, streaming
                    away in all directions: north, east, and south, as well as west.</p>
            <p>Although several attempts were made to utilize the land and improvements the Saints left behind,
                    Nauvoo ceased being a city even more quickly than it had become one. For almost a century it had a
                    quiet and uneventful existence, differing from neighboring towns mainly by virtue of its stormy
                    past. Then the Saints returned. They set about rebuilding their <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> "Zion" and in the years since have carried out so many elaborate
                    restoration projects that the once deserted town has become an important museum of the history of
                    the Latter Day Saints and of midnineteenth century America. Accelerating interest in Nauvoo has
                    created a "demand for a brief but factual history of the city" (p. v), and in
                    response to this demand David and Delia Miller have reworked—by revising and abridging
                    it—the historical survey which Professor Miller conducted for the National Park Service
                    ten years ago.</p>
            <p>In much the same way that tourists are ushered from one carefully restored room to another in Nauvoo
                    buildings, the Millers' narrative takes the reader on a hurried tour through Mormon history
                    from 1839 to 1847. With maps and pictures provided as reference points, the historical events are
                    set in order and exhibited in proper chronological place. Though one must turn to the appendix to
                    find it, a section on pre-Mormon Nauvoo sets the scene, and a final chapter explains what happened
                    to the town after the Saints left and describes its recent rebuilding. The outcome is an attractive
                    historical guidebook and an adequate chronicle, but it is not a satisfactory <hi rend="i">history</hi> of Nauvoo.</p>
            <p>The authors worked with evidence drawn from an astonishingly limited number of primary sources and
                    apparently only consulted a scattered assortment of the substantial body <pb n="282" id="VAA4025-071-3-082"/> of secondary works on the subject. But insufficient research is not the
                    main reason the book is unsatisfactory. Brevity is not its major problem either. The difficulty is
                    conceptual; the raw material of Nauvoo history is all there, but the authors fail to see it. Their
                    narrow conception of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> portion of the Mormon past as an "epoch in American frontier history"
                    (p. v) leads to a superficial account which describes surface motivations, emphasizes political and
                    economic explanations, neglects the religious dimension of the Nauvoo experience, and almost
                    entirely ignores the social and religious radicalism of the Saints. Tourists will find it useful;
                    those with anything more than a casual interest in Mormon history should look elsewhere for
                    information about the City of Joseph.</p>

            <p>Since the emergence of a strong feminist movement in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the 1960s, many women have begun to look more closely at the ways in which laws,
                    socialization processes, the economy, and the mass media prevent women from achieving their full
                    potential. In <hi rend="i">The Ladies of Seneca Falls</hi> Miriam Gurko attempts to demonstrate to
                    contemporary feminists that their rebellion is not new but has clear historical antecedents in the
                    women's movement for the nineteenth century. This movement was far more than just a crusade
                    for the vote, she asserts. Against strong opposition from both men <hi rend="i">and</hi> women,
                    nineteenth century reformers fought for many of the legal and social rights still being sought
                    today.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Ladies of Seneca Falls</hi> is structured around a series of minibiographies of the
                    leading nineteenth century reformers, from the Grimké sisters and Margaret Fuller to
                    Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Lucy Stone. Gurko uses these biographical sketches to
                    illuminate the <pb n="283" id="VAA4025-071-3-083"/> general problems of American women in the
                    nineteenth century. For example, she describes Stanton's drive to acquire an unusually
                    broad education as a reaction to her father's belief that only a boy could bring honor and
                    distinction to the family, a conviction shared by most nineteenth century Americans.
                    Stanton's early consciousness of women's inferior status was reinforced by
                    encounters with the numerous women who came to her father's law office in a fruitless
                    search for legal redress against profligate or tyrannical husbands.</p>
            <p>Gurko deftly demonstrates the breadth of the nineteenth century women's movement,
                    summarizing both the ideas articulated by Mary Wollstonecraft, Fuller, and John Stuart Mill and the
                    demands for specific changes made by reformers such as Stanton, Anthony, and Stone. She recreates
                    the often overlooked split in the women's rights movement in the 1870s as the more radical
                    reformers—who asserted that all facets of society, including religion and the family,
                    needed to be overhauled—broke away from the conservatives who felt that the vote was the
                    most important object of agitation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Ladies of Seneca Falls</hi> is aimed primarily at a popular rather than a scholarly
                    audience. The book lacks footnotes and relies heavily upon the pioneering work of Eleanor Flexner
                    and Aileen Kraditor, as well as on Stanton's own <hi rend="i">History of Woman
                    Suffrage</hi> (1881). Yet, for the reader unfamilar with recent developments in women's
                    history, Gurko <hi rend="i">offers a sympathetic, concise, and up to date summary of</hi> the fight
                    for women's rights in America from the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries. The
                    title, <hi rend="i">The Ladies of Seneca Falls</hi>, does not do justice to the book. It offers far
                    more than a biographical overview of the women present at the Seneca Falls convention. Furthermore,
                    it makes clear the psychological tensions felt by many of the nineteenth century reformers as they
                    acted in ways considered definitely <hi rend="i">unladylike</hi> by their hostile contemporaries.
                        <hi rend="i">The Ladies of Seneca, Falls</hi> might well encourage the reader to dip back into
                    the letters, addresses, and autobiographies of the nineteenth century feminists, selections from

            <p>In <hi rend="i">Movers and Shakers</hi> June Sochen has given a well documented overview of some
                    feminist writers and activists of the twentieth century. She has included material which has
                    hitherto not been available in one volume and therefore has made feminists' ideas more
                    readily accessible than in the past. Furthermore, she has shown the continuity, together with the
                    changes, in several ideologies of the period between 1910 and 1970. Sochen also successfully imparts
                    the flavor of the times by providing biographical information, thus illustrating the relationship
                    between feminists' everyday lives and their thought.</p>
            <p>Despite these important assets, the book lacks cohesive analysis and depth. Its organization is tied
                    to three types of feminists—"generals," "radicals,"
                    and "pragmatics"—without a definition as to how these categories are
                    clearly distinguishable. Moreover, discussion seldom leads to rigorous examination of ideas and
                    their theoretical underpinnings. For example, feminists of both the early and late periods have
                    pursued socialist principles and programs to varying degrees. Although Sochen points this out, she
                    does not analyze the overriding historical significance of <hi rend="i">why</hi> feminists have
                    sought collective activity and a resolution of the class question. Investigation and evaluation of
                    these issues are necessary, especially in assessing realistic prospects for changes in the roles and
                    status of women. Instead, Sochen ends wistfully, stating that "feminism's only
                    hope, apparently, is that human beings can produce a society made up of psychically sound people
                    …" (p. 300). No mention is made of the objective conditions that encourage
                    exploitation and domination. Conceivably, different use of the data on the family might lead to a
                    more profound conclusion than one where the "home," "Mom,"
                    "happiness," "private property," and "profit"
                    are simply manifestations of "primal and everlasting" American qualities (p. 299).
                    On the other hand, Sochen admirably focuses on feminists' inability to get away from an
                    orthodox view of motherhood, stressing that this difficulty is a major roadblock to women's
                    liberation. Throughout the book alternatives for child care are discussed. <pb n="285" id="VAA4025-071-3-085"/> But again Sochen does not deal with the fact that feminists'
                    rhetoric did not find a workable solution.</p>
            <p>The heterosexual bias of the author is surprising in view of the fact that the women's
                    movement has had to confront the ideology and practice of lesbianism, especially in its contemporary
                    phase. Only at one point does she address herself to the issue and then only in a way that
                    denigrates lesbians and portrays them as extremists, a "minority" outside the
                    specter of "healthy heterosexuality" (p. 279). Also, Sochen fails to analyze <hi rend="i">why</hi> these ideas and practices have been repressed historically or to account for
                    their recent public emergence.</p>
            <p>Sochen's conventionally narrow definition of legitimate womanhood also leads her to exclude
                    important black feminists, such as Mary Terrell, Ida Wells Barnett, Frances Harper, Josephine
                    Ruffin, Margaret Washington, Amy Jacques-Garvey, and Pat Robinson. Furthermore, she ignores the
                    crucial question of racism in the all white General Federation of Women's Clubs, an
                    organization she covers extensively in the "pragmatist" category.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Movers and Shakers</hi> is a first step in the review of much feminist literature.
                    However, it leaves important questions unraised and unexamined. Next, a thorough and comprehensive
                    analysis is needed. When that is accomplished, feminism will no longer be seen as an isolated
                    phenomenon representing the views of a few privileged Anglo women agitators, but as symptomatic of
                    serious social problems.</p>

            <p>As William Preston Vaughn says in the preface of his book, revisionist studies of the political and
                    economic history of the period from 1865 to 1877 have treated education in a cursory manner,
                    although changes in education were one of "the most vital, visible, and lasting
                    achievements of Reconstruction" (p. ix). His book, winner of a Phi Alpha Theta Award, is a
                    worthwhile contribution toward correcting this <pb n="286" id="VAA4025-071-3-086"/> deficiency. It
                    synthesizes much earlier research on special aspects of the subject and also embodies extensive,
                    painstaking research in a variety of primary materials. The book would have been strengthened by
                    more use of such black newspapers as are extant and other sources showing attitudes of blacks and by
                    a more in depth discussion of attitudes of both whites and blacks.</p>
            <p>The basic subjects covered are the beginnings of education for blacks, southern white attitudes on
                    the subject, and integration (or absence of it) in the schools of the Reconstruction years. Vaughn
                    traces the early work of private groups, notably the American Missionary Association and the
                    Freedmen's Bureau, both of which had completed their major education efforts by 1869. He
                    next examines the debates on education in the state constitutional conventions and provisions of the
                    state constitutions of the Reconstruction years. As is generally known, the only two constitutions
                    which appeared to prohibit segregated schools were those of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Vaughn has examined surviving evidence more exhaustively than earlier scholars but
                    agrees with them that the only significant attempt at integrating schools at the elementary and
                    secondary level was in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He traces in some detail the fight of Thomas W. Conway to promote integration in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where blacks held greater power in the legislature than in any other state, efforts to
                    integrate the state university, which was already demoralized by the war, led to resignations by
                    white faculty members and withdrawals of white students. The legislature attempted a program of
                    scholarships to enable poor but able blacks to attend the college, a measure far in advance of the
                    times and one which was bitterly resented by the white population. A few black state officials
                    enrolled in the university to promote integration. During the few years in which blacks were
                    admitted, an impressive list of future black leaders attended the university.</p>
            <p>Vaughn also discusses congressional policy toward the education of blacks. In the <placeName>
                        <country reg="dcu">District of Columbia</country>
                    </placeName> a system of separate schools for blacks was authorized. Segregation and the inferior
                    quality of the schools aroused deep resentment among blacks, but few members of Congress, with the
                    exception of Charles Sumner, supported efforts at integrating <pb n="287" id="VAA4025-071-3-087"/>
                    the schools. In order to secure adoption of Sumner's Civil Rights Act of 1875 it was
                    necessary to delete the section on schools. Finally Vaughn shows how Barnas Sears, general agent of
                    the Peabody Fund, helped to inhibit any tendency which might have existed to promote integrated
                    education by lobbying against the schools section in the Civil Rights Bill and by giving financial
                    aid from the Peabody Fund only to schools in the South which were segregated.</p>

            <p>John T. Flanagan has not written a biography of Edgar Lee Masters. Neither is this book a critical
                    analysis of Masters' work, nor is it a final evaluation of Masters' place in
                    literary history. Instead, Flanagan has published a "survey of the critical reception of
                    his [Masters'] poetry and prose as countless reviewers, essayists, and literary historians
                    viewed his writing" (p. iii). In brief, this is a study about what Masters'
                    contemporaries thought of him as a writer.</p>
            <p>During the summer of 1949 this reviewer, then a student, found Professor Flanagan to be a very sound
                    and meticulous scholar. This book confirms such a conclusion. The notes at the end of each chapter
                    illustrate how exhaustively Flanagan has searched at home and abroad for the comments written by
                    Masters' critics. In short, Flanagan demonstrates impeccable scholarship in this work.</p>
            <p>The book begins with a short introduction, followed by a chapter dealing with the life of the Spoon
                    River poet. Basically using a chronological approach, Flanagan then takes the reader through the
                    detailed, critical responses to Masters' poetry and prose. The early works of verse and
                    drama are discussed, followed by comment on the <hi rend="i">Spoon River Anthology</hi>, which work
                    "catapulted him [Masters] into fame and began a critical discussion of his poetry which
                    raged unabated for several decades" (p. 21). What the reviewers had to say about the <hi rend="i">Domesday Book</hi>, dramatic verse narratives, fiction, biography, and later verse are
                    all included in Flanagan's study. Lastly, the author explains how the literary historians
                    and anthologists have dealt with Masters.</p>
            <pb n="288" id="VAA4025-071-3-088"/>
            <p>Without question, the author accomplishes what he set out to do. This is <hi rend="i">the</hi>
                    definitive study of the critics' opinions of Masters' voluminous writings.
                    Flanagan's prose is clear, crisp, and candid. He has great empathy for Masters, but his
                    intimate feelings do not hamper his objectivity. Unfavorable, as well as favorable, criticism is
                    examined thoroughly. For example, in the chapter discussing fiction <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Flanagan</settlement>
                    </placeName> states: "On the balance it must be admitted that Masters did not write
                    distinguished fiction" (p. 106). This same candor about what the critics wrote is displayed
                    in every chapter of the book. And by reading what the critics had to say one gains much knowledge
                    about Masters and the literary climate that prevailed in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> prior to World War II. As a social critic, Masters had much to say about life.
                    Flanagan's informative book caused this reviewer to reread the <hi rend="i">Spoon River
                        Anthology</hi> in its entirety. Although Flanagan found many areas of agreement among the
                    critics, his book points out that literary criticism is not an exact science.</p>
            <p>This book will be of interest to instructors who teach literary criticism and to students who are
                    interested in their midwestern heritage.</p>

            <p>The elections are those of 1800, 1836, 1860, 1896, and 1936. The authors: five professional
                    historians—Merrill D. Peterson, Joel H. Silbey, Don E. Fehrenbacher, Gilbert C. Fite, and
                    Donald R. McCoy—each dealing with a year.</p>
            <p>It is McCoy's judgment (p. 56) that 1836 and 1896 were "on a lower level of
                    significance" than 1800, 1860, and 1936. What about 1796? 1856? Fehrenbacher rejects them
                    (p. 34) as choices for major cruciality because each was "reversed four years
                    later." 1832? Silbey points out that half the states then still had "essentially
                    one-party systems" (p. 25), whereas <pb n="289" id="VAA4025-071-3-089"/> in 1836
                    "the Democrats dramatically struck out in new directions with far-reaching consequences for
                    the future course of American politics" (p. 16).</p>
            <p>Peterson's treatment of 1800 strikes this reviewer as the least complex. Thomas
                    Jefferson's inauguration in 1801 "completed the first democratic transfer of power
                    in the nation's history" (p. 1). Jefferson "adhered to what he came to
                    call his ‘experiment’ in unmolested freedom of discussion. … The
                    principle was riveted on Jefferson's successors. And this was the critical, the enduring,
                    importance of the election of 1800" (p. 13).</p>
            <p>Addressing himself to a more complicated topic, Fehrenbacher does more
                    ranging—justifiably, in this reviewer's opinion. He emphasizes that 1860
                    "was one of a number of elections that may be labeled <hi rend="i">crucial</hi> but the
                    only one that proved to be <hi rend="i">catastrophic</hi>" (p. 30). Fehrenbacher cites a
                    definition of "crucial" ("involving a final and supreme
                    decision") and comments: "The final decision may not be the truly effective
                    one" (p. 37). He contrasts 1844 with 1860, terms the former "a real
                    forking-point," and even opines that the 1860 election "may be viewed as a
                    terminal symptom" (p. 38). Nevertheless, the candidates, atmosphere, and mechanics of
                    politics in 1860–1861 did indeed make the election crucial.</p>
            <p>In 1896, Fite reminds us, William Jennings Bryan showed the "direct relationship between
                    economic and political power" (p. 50) more clearly than any candidate before him. Fite sees
                    the nominees' images as especially consequential: "Thus McKinley and the gold
                    standard became the symbols of Americanism, nationalism, patriotism, and social stability"
                    (p. 53). McCoy adds that 1896 marked the start of "a sixteen-year period of strong
                    [Eepublican] control" (p. 56).</p>
            <p>McCoy depicts 1936 as demonstrating that big government was "here to stay." The
                    election "perpetuated not only the two-party system but also the concept of deciding
                    national differences at the polls"; the voters preferred "scattered remedies and
                    reforms" to risking "a thorough-going change of the system." True, much
                    of what 1936 developed "had come together in 1932." Yet now it was evident that
                    "the shift … was not just ‘a sometime thing’ "
                    (p. 72).</p>
            <p>Other candidates for consideration in a list of crucial elections are those of 1789 (mentioned by
                    Fehrenbacher), <pb n="290" id="VAA4025-071-3-090"/> 1828, 1832, 1844, 1900, 1912, 1920, and 1932.
                    Strong cases can be made for at least three of them. At the same time, most of the conclusions
                    reached by the five scholars command respect. Keys to the logic of what is crucial are just such
                    words and phrases as "defining," "shaping,"
                    "far-reaching," "enduring," "decades to come,"
                    and "here to stay."</p>

                        </placeName>, 1900–1916.</hi> By Robert Sherman La Forte. (Lawrence: The University
                    Press of <placeName>

            <p>Professor La Forte has taken progressive Republicans in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> as his theme. These Republicans emerged in the "boss-busting" party
                    factionalism at the turn of the century, dominated state Republicanism for a time, and then
                    abdicated party control as they followed Theodore Roosevelt into the Bull Moose episode, after which
                    they made their "trip back" to party regularity, although no longer as leaders. La
                    Forte has used—with discretion, objectivity, irony, and sophistication—a range
                    of documentary collections for local and state figures and for national personalities. William Allen
                    White, for example, plays a large role in the narrative, but his recollections as recorded in his
                    "highly imaginative autobiography" do not determine the author's
                    analyses.</p>
            <p>For historians, political progressivism has not appeared to be as logical, as consistent, or as
                    clearly defined as it did to those who participated in it and who provided the sources from which
                    the scholar derives his narrative and draws his interpretations. Students of progressivism at the
                    state level have produced one set of generalizations, while interpreters of progressivism at the
                    national level have produced other not entirely harmonious ones. Setting up one set of these
                    generalizations and knocking it down with "facts" has been a professional pastime
                    to some extent, and La Forte engages in it. He finds, for example, that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> progressive Republicans were akin to the prototype established by George E. Mowry, but
                    interestingly enough he finds that regular Republicans and Democratic party leaders in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> also fit the prototype. Unlike Hoyt L. Warner's urban findings in <pb n="291" id="VAA4025-071-3-091"/>
                    <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, La Forte sees <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> progressive Republicans as receiving their greatest support in the least urbanized part
                    of the state. In agreement with nearly everyone, La Forte shows his progressives to be definitely
                    middle class in composition and self serving in objectives. Republican progressives in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> had and made no appeal to the working people of eastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> cities because they could not enact the sort of workmen's compensation or
                    employers' liability legislation wanted there. The small town morality which espoused
                    prohibition also alienated urban voters. Progressivism emerged in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> at a time of increasing prosperity; it was not, thus, an economic protest movement as
                    populism had been. The older progressives had opposed populism in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, but younger progressives were motivated by "power, prestige, and
                    pelf" (p. 2) more than any ideological commitment. There was a clear line of connection
                    between populism and progressivism, however, in that both derived from an established reform
                    tradition which predated either.</p>
            <p>Economic legislation was the greatest passion of the progressive Republicans in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, but, in La Forte's view, their achievements were not nearly as significant as
                    they believed them to be. Railroad regulation, more equitable tax laws and a state tax commission,
                    home rule for cities, lobbyist registration, votes for women, direct election of senators, an
                    enthusiasm for (but nonenactment of) initiative and referendum, prohibition and anticigarette
                    legislation, a general Sabbatarian disposition but sense enough not to carry it too
                    far—these are among their enthusiasms and accomplishments.</p>
            <p>The book chronicles the personalities of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> Republican progressives and shows their manipulative talents rather than discussing
                    their ideological objectives. Generally speaking, they were conservatives, and they believed their
                    own campaign speeches in which "integrity and wise policies" were recommended to
                    the voters. They did not alter the usual tenor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> politics. All in all, La Forte has produced a book which will stand up well in its
                    substantial scholarship and in its clarity of presentation; it will, moreover, hold its own as other
                    scholars hereafter interpret and generalize about the progressive movement, or movements.</p>

                        Wilson.</hi> By Arthur A. Ekirch, Jr. (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>: New Viewpoints, 1974. Pp. x, 308. Bibliographical essay, index. $10.00.)</head>
            <p>In this volume the author, Arthur A. Ekirch, Jr., describes in broad strokes the first major reform
                    movement in twentieth century America. He concentrates not only on its political aspects but also on
                    its intellectual foundations. In his most striking interpretation he finds important parallels
                    between the concepts of progressivism in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and state democracy or socialism in Europe. Too often, he argues, historians of the
                    Progressive Period, in the belief that the American experience was isolated and unique, have
                    neglected similar strains of ideology that existed across the Atlantic. But Ekirch finds many
                    liberal antecedents in a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bismarkian</settlement>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> that stressed collectivism, statism, nationalism, and centralized power. The author
                    describes the growing belief in America that solutions could be found by the organized, purposeful
                    state. Instead of a drift in American society there grew the idea that a mastery of forces could be
                    achieved. Under the strong leadership of Theodore Roosevelt, America became an organized nation that
                    cast its gaze not only on internal conquests but on those overseas. (Ekirch correctly points out the
                    important role of Elihu Root in the latter.) While TR escapes serious criticism in the growth of
                    progressivism, the prophet armed, Woodrow Wilson, does not. Ekirch finds Wilson's policies
                    "hopelessly out of date" (p. 269) by the time of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> Peace Conference as the First World War played a most crucial role in the development
                    of a nationalistic progressivism that passed Wilson by.</p>
            <p>This is a most perplexing book. One's first reaction is that little is presented that is new
                    and original. It is based largely, if not wholly, on secondary sources (there are no footnotes) and
                    appears to have been designed more as a textbook survey than as a monograph. Nor is the writing as
                    strong and as clear as in Ekirch's previous books; this is especially true of his
                    conclusion. Despite these points, however, the book has merit. Its strength lies in its
                    incorporation of much of the recent literature and its periodic flashes of insight into the
                    progressive mind. The tying together of <pb n="293" id="VAA4025-071-3-093"/> domestic progressivism
                    and overseas imperialism is very well done, as is the description of Wilson. The volume is a solid
                    and competent, but unexciting-, introduction to the era of progressivism.</p>

            <p>This book is one volume of a series which is designed to cover the entire history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and it is a significant contribution to the historiography of the period from 1929 to
                    1945. Packed with descriptive action, Professor Kirkendall's book deals with two crises in
                    the nation's life—the major depression and World War II. The stock market crash,
                    October, 1929, ushered in a depression. At late as 1932, however, Herbert Hoover urged a balanced
                    budget to be wrought, he said, by less aid to the poor and to the unemployed, by tight money, and by
                    more taxes.</p>
            <p>To the author the most obvious feature of the New Deal was an increase of the federal
                    government's power in the economy. This enhancement of power was necessary because of the
                    maldistribution of wealth, the unjustified power of the rich, and the control by this group of the
                    government. The writer is careful to emphasize that the New Deal was not meant to destroy capitalism
                    but to reform it. By 1935 the changes brought about by the New Deal were practically finished. Such
                    changes, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kirkendall</settlement>
                    </placeName> states convincingly, were designed to improve the living standards of the low income,
                    the aged, and the underprivileged.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the best writing in this excellently written book is the brillant analysis of the election of
                    1936. In this analysis one reads of the increased role of organized labor in American affairs.
                    Indeed, labor grew rapidly when nourished by the milk of the New Deal. After 1936 increasing
                    opposition to the New Deal became apparent and flourished under the impact of Franklin D.
                    Roosevelt's fight with the Supreme Court, by the national recession, and by the split in
                    the Democratic party in Congress. Although by 1940 the conservatives <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-071-3-094"/> were much stronger, FDR prevented the New Deal from floundering.</p>
            <p>Beyond Washington there was action too. Some states, with progressive governors and legislatures,
                    initiated New Deals in their respective bailiwicks. Nor were the cities wholly unrepresented in
                    reform programs. Literary figures lagged behind in treating social problems. John
                    Steinbeck's <hi rend="i">Grapes of Wrath</hi> was an exception.</p>
            <p>American social classes were not destroyed by the New Deal, nor was poverty eliminated, though it was
                    somewhat diminished. Capitalism was maintained, though it was more regulated. As the author
                    demonstrates, reforms and relief restrained radicalism.</p>
            <p>In 1941 war came not as unexpectedly as many thought. General Douglas McArthur in the Philippines and
                    American generals at Pearl Harbor were notified of a probable Japanese attack, but unfortunately
                    some of the messages were not received. Once in the war the <placeName>
                  <country reg="-us">United
                            States</country>, <country reg="enk">England</country>
               </placeName>, and Russia disagreed
                    repeatedly on where to fight. In America as President Roosevelt stated: "Dr. Win The War
                    replaced Dr. New Deal." During the war, big business, big labor, and big government all
                    grew bigger. Millions of Americans moved to cities in search of better jobs and higher living
                    standards. With blacks moving northward the war greatly affected American race relations. If Jim
                    Crowism was not destroyed, the white supremacy concept was at least shattered.</p>
            <p>The author's conclusion that the greatest changes in our culture in the period from 1929 to
                    1945 was more collectivization in the economy and greater power of the military in business and
                    government will not be challenged by many students of recent American history. Of the many books
                    written on this period of our recent past, Kirkendall's book is one of the very best.</p>

            <p>This is a strange and fascinating book by the youngest of the Eisenhower brothers, a man who enjoyed
                    a long and <pb n="295" id="VAA4025-071-3-095"/> valuable career in government and higher education
                    and close personal and intellectual ties with his most famous brother. A somewhat undisciplined
                    volume, it appears to be four books in one. It is a partial autobiography that emphasizes the
                    author's career in government, above all, his relations with presidents. It is also a
                    history of the presidency during the past sixty years, an essay in political science, and a series
                    of essays on subjects of interest to the author.</p>
            <p>The sprawling character of the book tempts this reviewer to wish that he could have been its editor.
                    If this had been the case, the author would have been encouraged to throw away the surveys of
                    presidential administrations, publish the essays in other places, and enlarge the autobiography,
                    chiefly by telling more about higher education in recent years and freeing himself from at least
                    some of the inhibitions that prevented him from writing about his experiences as fully as is
                    desirable from the historian's point of view. Those inhibitions affected his discussion of
                    his work with Dwight Eisenhower while the later served as president.</p>
            <p>The title of the book has two meanings. One refers to the author's work for every president
                    from Calvin Coolidge to Richard Nixon; the second concerns the present crisis of the presidency. The
                    president, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Eisenhower insists, needs help; the job has become too big for one person. In a book
                    liberally sprinkled with proposals for change, the most important is the proposal for the creation
                    of two executive vice presidents to whom the president would, while holding on to responsibility,
                    delegate time consuming tasks. The proposal seems sensible and, given the rich experience upon which
                    it is based, surely deserves serious consideration.</p>
            <p>To this reviewer the most valuable parts of the book are the discussions of the Eisenhower
                    presidency. These discussions have value in spite of the limitations referred to above. They
                    challenge some widely held views concerning such matters as President Eisenhower's control
                    of his administration and his opinion of Nixon, and they offer support for the rather small but
                    growing "revisionist" movement now seeking to raise the appraisal of this
                    president by historians. As one might expect, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Eisenhower has great admiration for his brother's handling of the office and
                    suggests that scholars will come to regard him as a great president. The account in these pages
                    lends weight to interpretations that <pb n="296" id="VAA4025-071-3-096"/> portray restraint in the
                    use of power as a distinguishing trait of the Eisenhower presidency. Such restraint has greater
                    appeal now than it had to most historians who attempted appraisals a decade or more ago.</p>

                    William Willard Howard's description of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and its residents as of 1888 is informative and interesting, but it is a partial and
                    not altogether accurate view of the Hoosier capital. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> imprint of New Englanders did play a considerable role in the town's
                    development as Howard indicates, but by ignoring the even larger impact of southerners, the author
                    distorts his description. Howard's view of the Battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> in 1811 is also badly out of focus. Had this engagement been as smashing a defeat of
                    the Indians as he suggests, the Old Northwest would have been spared most of the costly Indian
                    warfare which engulfed it during the War of 1812. This inflation of the result of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> engagement, however, was doubtless inspired by the fact that in 1888 Benjamin Harrison,
                    grandson of Governor William Henry Harrison who led the attack against the Indians in 1811, was a
                    presidential candidate. Howard exhibits much discernment in observing the bias of "country
                    members" of the legislature against <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and also in noting the traditional Hoosier penchant for politics by commenting that
                    "the Indiana man is yet to be found who has not some concern in the politics of his
                    State." Howard shrewdly points out that in its economic growth <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been overshadowed by <placeName>

                    </placeName>. But in 1888 he thought it yet had a large potential as a manufacturing center,
                    especially because of its great importance as a railroad terminus and its proximity to the recently
                    discovered natural gas fields of the state. A variety of broadbrush observations, some penetrating
                    and some superficial, concern the status of business, labor, politics, the theater, art and music,
                    religion, schools, public buildings, and architecture. Howard expected "<placeName>

                    </placeName> to give a good account of herself in the future," adding: "She has an
                    excellent start in life, and her people have plenty of pluck and energy to back it up."

                    that time. As this publication and its related documents indicate, even in 1975 various of the key
                    facts about this strike are yet in controversy. This brief account is enhanced by relevant

                    perhaps cannot be entirely without errors, but it is disconcerting to find a picture of the
                    Constitution Elm with the comment that it "is still in a good state of
                    preservation," followed pages later by one of the weather beaten stump of the same tree
                    (pp. 41, 46). Moreover, in listing early governors of Indiana, Funk omits Ratliff Boon, who
                    completed Jonathan Jenning's second term in the closing months of 1822; and it is incorrect
                    to indicate that Boon served continuously as lieutenant governor from 1819 to 1825 (p. 61). Funk
                    has, however, offered a variety of interesting and useful information. This booklet can be purchased
