            <p>In the last public utterance of his life, John C. Calhoun told the nation that it was held together
                    by cords of union, cords that were being severed one by one by the rise of the abolitionist movement
                    in the North. One of these cords was religious, straining as the great national
                    denominations—Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist—developed sectional fissures or
                    split, North versus South. These divisions would have a profound impact on the future of American
                    Protestantism, with consequences even to this day.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such divisiveness was not limited to the "mainline" denominations, nor did it occur
                    solely along sectional lines. The movement for immediate, unconditional abolition of slavery also
                    splintered churches in the North. Many denominations looked on the immediate abolition movement that
                    rose in the early 1830s as dangerous and heterodox, tied to deism and infidelity and challenging
                    both Scriptural Christianity and the peace of the churches. Abolitionists responded with
                    "come-outer" movements in which they sought to free themselves of ties with
                    spurious Christians implicated in the sin of slavery. Thus new denominations were born.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Surprisingly, among the groups that found themselves embroiled in controversy in the 1830s and 1840s
                    was the Society of Friends, or Quakers. Friends were no strangers to theological dispute; they had
                    split into Hicksite and Orthodox factions in a bitter confrontation in the 1820s, and in the 1840s
                    new divisions were brewing. But unlike many other denominations, Quakerism had a long antislavery
                    heritage that had put it in the vanguard of the abolitionist movement. By 1784, the various yearly
                    meetings of Friends in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> had ruled that no member could own slaves and that those who were slaveowners were to
                    give slaves their freedom. Some Quakers chose to leave the society rather than embrace emancipation,
                    but most submitted to the demand for manumission. Not a few Indiana Quakers in the 1840s were
                    children or grandchildren of former slaveholders. Thus, Indiana Friends should have been spared
                    contention on the subject.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That, however, was not to be the case. The antislavery movement in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and Great Britain took a new turn in the late 1820s and early 1830s, culminating in the
                    formation of the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1833. The keynotes of the new movement were the
                    insistence that slaveholding was a sin and the call for its end through immediate emancipation. This
                    position set abolitionists apart from earlier antislavery efforts, including Quaker ones, which had
                    called for gradual emancipation, often linked to the forced colonization of freed slaves overseas.
                    Abolitionism was also distinguished by its missionary zeal for organizing auxiliaries and flooding
                    the country with antislavery literature. By striking at the "cords of union," it
                    encountered ferocious opposition, both in the North and South. The Quaker attitude toward the new
                    abolitionist movement was complex. Some Friends, to be sure, embraced it; about a third of the
                    founding members of the American <list type="footnotes">

                            <p>Some explanation is necessary about the organizational structure and components of the
                                Society of Friends in the nineteenth century: (1) The lowest rung on the Quaker
                                organizational ladder was the indulged or preparative meeting, often referred to simply
                                as a meeting. It can best be thought of as an individual congregation. One or more
                                meetings made up a (2) monthly meeting, which was the basic unit of Quaker organization.
                                It had the power to receive and disown members, to hold property, and to solemnize
                                marriages. Two or more monthly meetings made up a (3) quarterly meeting. The quarterly
                                meeting dealt with problems—usually of doctrine and
                                organization—deemed too important to be left to monthly meetings. Finally,
                                several quarterly meetings made up a (4) yearly meeting. Until 1902, the yearly meeting
                                was the ultimate authority for all Orthodox Friends living within its bounds. It made
                                decisions on both doctrine and discipline and served as a court of final appeal. Each
                                yearly meeting was independent of all others, but the Orthodox yearly meetings were tied
                                closely together by an intricate system of correspondence. See Thomas D. Hamm, <hi rend="i">The Transformation of American Quakerism: Orthodox Friends,
                                    1800–1907</hi> (<placeName>

                    <pb n="119" id="VAA4025-087-2-009"/> Anti-Slavery Society were Quakers, and Friends such as John
                    Greenleaf Whittier, Abby Kelley, and Sarah and Angelina Grimke were among the new
                    movement's best-known proponents. But such men and women were exceptional, even among
                    Quakers. As Thomas E. Drake noted a generation ago, the few vocal and radical abolitionists among
                    Friends in the East soon found themselves isolated and, in some cases, purged.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indiana, however, seemed to offer hope to abolitionists. By the late 1830s, Indiana Yearly Meeting of
                    Orthodox Friends was one of the largest in the world, growing steadily through migration, especially
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>. Indiana Quakers had formed a solid phalanx to keep slavery out of the state, and they
                    had vigorously protested against enactment of the notoriously racist Indiana Black Laws in 1831. In
                    1836 the yearly meeting had warned its members against joining any association that advocated
                    colonization, which the yearly meeting condemned as "the unrighteous work of
                    expatriation." In the same year and in 1837, it issued statements that hailed the growth of
                    "a lively sense of the iniquity and horrors of Slavery." At the same time,
                    however, it cautioned against joining "with others not of our society," lest the
                    standing of Friends as a "peculiar people," separate from "the
                    world," be compromised.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1839 the situation in Indiana changed dramatically. The catalyst was the arrival of Arnold Buffum,
                    who came from <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> as the duly accredited agent of the American Anti-Slavery Society. A state antislavery
                    society had been formed in Indiana a year earlier but had made slow progress, and Buffum was charged
                    with organizing new affiliates in the state. Buffum targeted the Quaker communities of east-central
                    Indiana, especially those in <placeName>

                    Friends, however, looked on him with fear and mistrust. Buffum, after all, had been a Friend but had
                    been disowned (the Quaker term for excommunicated) in the East and had come west pursued by letters
                    and traveling Quaker ministers warning against him as an infidel and deceiver.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Buffum's success created fears at the highest level of Indiana Yearly Meeting. In 1840 the
                    Meeting for Sufferings, the yearly meeting's equivalent of an executive committee, issued a
                    statement condemning membership in antislavery societies, and a year later it advised that local
                    meetinghouses be closed to antislavery gatherings. In the fall of 1842, it took the final step of
                    removing from the Meeting for Sufferings eight members with abolitionist sympathies and ordered that
                    no one who identified himself or herself as an abolitionist could hold any position of
                    responsibility in the society. Thus repudiated and in their own minds driven beyond endurance, the
                    abolitionist Friends separated to form the Indiana Yearly Meeting of Anti-Slavery Friends.
                    Ultimately perhaps two thousand people, or about a tenth of the yearly meeting's
                    membership, separated.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the events of the separation are not in dispute, its causes are. At the time, there was no lack
                    of explanations. Anti-Slavery Friends saw themselves upholding traditional Quaker testimony against
                    slavery, while their opponents had abandoned it. Their opponents, meanwhile, fond of
                    non-Friends' applause, prosperous because of economic ties with the South, and committed to
                    the Whig party (Henry Clay himself had been in <placeName>

                    were purged from the Meeting for Sufferings and had been warmly received by leading Friends), looked
                    on abolition "as calculated to deprive them of the means of amassing wealth."
                    "Body" Friends, as conservative opponents of abolition became known, responded
                    that Anti-Slavery Friends were abandoning Quaker tradition to ally themselves with non-Friends, many
                    of whom were infidels leading notoriously immoral lives, thus endangering traditions of peculiarity
                    and separation from the world that characterized true Quakers. Abolition, with its mob scenes,

                    protesting when it removed them from important posts because of their actions, the abolitionists
                    showed a regard for self and a contempt for the yearly meeting that was incompatible with the

            <p>Subsequent scholarly analysis has not advanced much farther. No historian has accepted the argument
                    of Anti-Slavery Friends that the "Body" was indifferent to slavery. Separatists
                    were able to point to the statements of a few individual Friends who supported colonization or
                    questioned aiding fugitive slaves, but these were positions that the "Body"
                    continued to condemn. The old yearly meeting, moreover, opposed the annexation of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, continued to protest the legalized racism of Indiana law, and expanded its efforts to
                    aid free blacks. Instead, two lines of historical analysis have emerged. One, set forth most fully
                    by Ruth Anna Ketring in her 1937 biography of Charles Osborn, elder statesman and minister of
                    Anti-Slavery Friends, argued that the separation was a split between conservative Quakers who
                    "considered it little short of criminal for Friends to associate with
                    ‘worldly’ people," and progressives, "who saw no objection
                    to mingling with other people." The implication clearly was that Anti-Slavery Friends were
                    more open to outside influences. The other theory was advanced by Drake in his 1950 monograph, <hi rend="i">Quakers and Slavery in America.</hi> Drake emphasized social and economic factors;
                    because Indiana Yearly Meeting was the "melting pot" of American Quakerism, the
                    split was the result of the wide gulf between democratic, radical abolitionist Friends in the
                    countryside and the more conservative Quakers of the towns and cities, with their economic ties to
                    the South. Subsequent accounts have generally accepted these analyses.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>.</p>
            <p>Both historical interpretations, however, have their problems. Ketring's
                    "pro-outsider"—"anti-outsider" dichotomy runs aground
                    on facts pointed out by Anti-Slavery Friends at the time; the "Body" might condemn
                    "mixed" antislavery societies, but many of <list type="footnotes">

                    Theologically, it is easier to find clear signs of outside influences, mostly evangelical, in the
                    religious thought of anti-abolitionists such as Elijah Coffin, the clerk of the yearly meeting, and
                    Jeremiah Hubbard, its leading minister, than among Anti-Slavery Friends such as Osborn, who was
                    adamantly opposed to all doctrinal innovation. As for the second interpretation, economic
                    differences may have played a role, but a town versus countryside explanation of the split faces the
                    reality that nearly all Indiana Quakers in this period were rural. Indeed, although Indiana Yearly
                    Meeting's bounds in 1842 stretched from the vicinity of Mansfield, <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>There is, however, another model for analyzing the split using the techniques of quantitative
                    history: identifying the individuals on either side, looking at their characteristics, and learning
                    what they had in common. This model has been used extensively with considerable success for one
                    previous split, the Hicksite separation of 1827–1828, and to a lesser extent to identify
                    characteristics of Friends in other periods. Utilizing this technique will not only offer more
                    understanding of Quaker history, it will also help shed much-needed light on a neglected
                    subject—the failure of the organized antislavery movement in Indiana. In the words of one
                    contemporary, Indiana was a "hard place" for antislavery, Racism was firmly
                    embedded in state laws and in the attitudes of most Hoosiers. Organized abolition had come later to
                    Indiana than to almost any other northern state, and the historical consensus is that it was weaker
                    here than in any other free state. Both Whigs and Democrats condemned it, and it was popular sport
                    to break up antislavery meetings with rocks and rotten eggs. Before 1848, one editor claimed, the
                    abolitionist movement in Indiana was dominated largely by Wayne and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Henry County</region>

            <p>Ultimately, the decisions that Hoosier Quakers made are best explained not in terms of social and

                    craftsmen—carpenters, blacksmiths, shoemakers, and millers—who also farmed.
                    There was also a handful of shopkeepers. Only two professional men have been
                    identified—Robert Harrison, an English-born schoolmaster at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Dr. Vierling Kersey, a physician at <placeName>

            <p>Two considerations dictated the choice of these communities for study. First and foremost, material
                    from both is abundant. The records of both monthly meetings—consisting of books of
                    births, deaths, and marriages; and the minutes of the men's and women's monthly
                    meeting, with their records of business matters, removals and transfers of membership, reception and
                    disownment of members, and appointment of officers and committee members—are virtually
                    complete. Thus it was possible not only to identify virtually every Friend living in both
                    communities in 1842, but also such characteristics as age, place of birth, previous residence, time
                    of arrival in the community, family connections, appointment to offices, and relationships with the
                    meeting. Of equal significance is the 1842 tax duplicate for <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Henry County</region>
                    </placeName>, which includes the value of all real and personal property for each resident as well
                    as the location of landholdings, making it possible to measure wealth (or lack of it) and to plot
                    places of residence. Also of interest are the records of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Female Anti-Slavery Society—the only known records of any female antislavery
                    organization in the state—which permit comparisons of rates of participation in
                    abolitionist organizations before and after the separation. Finally, there are some scattered
                    manuscript correspondence, a few comments in the diaries of visiting Friends, some hints in
                    reminiscences, and one contemporary chronicle, <hi rend="i">A History of the Separation in Indiana

                    meetings did not begin disowning the separatists until September, 1843. Some Friends wavered between

                    example, alternated meetings before finally deciding to remain with the "Body."

                    felt so strongly about the antislavery cause that they were willing to organize a new yearly meeting
                    and break venerable ties, different from those Quakers who were more conservative and stood aloof

                    farmers who did not perceive any threat to their livelihood in abolition, were more open to a force
                    that extended the traditional testimony against slavery.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>Conversely, there is a growing body of historical literature suggesting just the opposite. Some
                    historians have argued that the key to reform activism was leisure. Wealth, they maintain, provided
                    the surplus to subscribe to antislavery journals and to have hired girls and hands to mind children
                    and work fields while husbands and wives went off to reform meetings. Poorer Friends, in contrast,
                    were so occupied with trying to scratch out a living that they could not spare the time (nor the
                    money) to become involved in antislavery. Thus, any significant differences in wealth and property
                    between the two sides were carefully analyzed.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

                    example, that Quakers who had only recently left the South were less open to a movement that made
                    for sectional discord, splitting them from old friends and family there, while those who had lived
                    longer in the North were more open to it? Or could it be that Friends who had arrived in the North
                    after 1830 had seen the hardening of proslavery sentiment in the South after Nat Turner's
                    Rebellion in 1831, and thus were convinced that only radical action would bring about abolition,
                    while older settlers remembered a less intransigent South and still put their faith in gradualism

                    speaking in meetings), elder (one charged with regulating the ministry), overseer (one who reported

                    wanted to liberalize the society? Thus, did the separation pit unruly Friends against the pillars of
                    the meetings, those with troubled pasts against the more observant and faithful, unlikely to
                    question established ways? To gauge this possibility, the minutes of both meetings were examined,
                    noting for each adult the number of committee appointments and offices held (a reliable indicator of
                    the influence, or <hi rend="i">weight,</hi> to use the favorite Quaker term) as well as any

            <p>Statistics in tables 1 and 2 show that when patterns of wealth and property holding are compared, no
                    clear pattern is discernible. In <placeName>

                    </placeName> Monthly Meeting, the average wealth of Anti-Slavery families was considerably higher
                    than that of "Body" Friends—$1,509.79 to
                    $1,121.66. This average is misleading, however, because it is skewed by the wealth of two
                    men among the abolitionists—Seth Hinshaw at about $5,000 and John Swain at
                    over $7,600—who together accounted for two-thirds of all of the property owned

                        <settlement type="city">Duck Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName> separatists. When a distribution of the wealth of the two groups is plotted, however,
                    it shows that more "Body" Friends had wealth of over $1,000 than was
                    the case with Anti-Slavery Friends. Thus a clear pattern is difficult to discern. In <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the average wealth of Anti-Slavery families was also higher than that of the
                    "Body"—$1,577.72 to $1,471.52. Plotting the
                    distribution of wealth shows that again Anti-Slavery Friends tended to be more
                    prosperous—over half possessed property worth at least $2,000, while only
                    about one-fifth of the "Body" Friends could claim the same. But there were also
                    Anti-Slavery Friends whose property holdings were minimal. Thus, an economic explanation of the
                    separation does not appear to hold true in these two communities because both sides were diverse in
                    total wealth. Prosperity may have made it possible for the families of William Macy, Walter

                    and Charity (Willits) Pitts of Greensboro from becoming abolitionists.</p>
            <p>As the map shows, plotting the residences of members of the two monthly meetings revealed some
                    interesting patterns. Assuming that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Greensboro were the centers of their monthly meetings, most Anti-Slavery Friends
                    lived on the fringes. The Swains, for example, were the only Quakers in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fall Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township, while the Wrights and the family of Solomon Cox, all separatists, accounted
                    for all but one of the Quaker families in <pb n="134" id="VAA4025-087-2-024"/>
                    <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township. Among the members of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName> Monthly Meeting, a majority of Anti-Slavery Friends lived on the western edge of the
                    monthly meeting's bounds in the vicinity of Elm Grove Meetinghouse. This might lead one to
                    think that Anti-Slavery Friends were isolated and deprived of opportunities for full participation
                    in the affairs of the society, but as will be seen later the monthly meeting minutes show this not
                    to be the case.</p>
            <p>One of the striking results of mapping residences is to show the tendency of Anti-Slavery Friends to
                    cluster, a tendency especially noticeable in the case of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName> group, where a majority lived on contiguous farms along <geogName>Blue
                    River</geogName>. For the most part, however, this grouping probably reflects the tendency of
                    families to settle near each other. In fact Anti-Slavery Friends on <geogName>Blue River</geogName>
                    consisted of three sibling pairs, all first cousins, while the clusters to the north were members of
                    the Wright and Hinshaw families.</p>
            <p>A consideration of the third possible explanation, place of origin, also showed some possibly
                    significant patterns. (See table 3.) One explanation suggests that older conflicts, previously
                    discussed, between coastal and piedmont Friends in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> may have carried over into these communities. The monthly meetings of Friends in
                    eastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> had sent sixty-eight adults to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Duck Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName>; only two joined Anti-Slavery Friends. Quakers from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, and those from eastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, whose family ties often were with <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> or eastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>, showed an equal antipathy for abolition. No Friend from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> joined Anti-Slavery Friends, and of the forty-six adults in the two monthly meetings
                    who had lived in eastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, only Walter and Rebecca (Cox) Edgerton and Mary (Pennington) White went with the
                    separatists. Also notable is the fact that none of the Friends born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, with the exception of James Gause of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, "came out," which ties in with another striking fact: while about a
                    quarter (129) of the adults in the two monthly meetings who remained with the
                    "Body" were born in the North, only six of the sixty-three adults who separated
                    were northern born.</p>
            <p>In contrast, certain patterns were also significant among the separatists. Most Anti-Slavery Friends
                    at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>

               </placeName>—sixteen of the twenty-two adults, in fact, had lived in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Guilford County</region>
                    </placeName>, the heart of piedmont <placeName>

                    </placeName>, half of the Anti-Slavery Friends had roots in two monthly meetings: Marlborough in

                    </placeName> Friends. It had been settled in the 1750s largely by relatives of the famous Quaker

                    </placeName> had been the heart of organized antislavery activity in the state.

                  <settlement type="city">Greene County</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
               </placeName>, was notable for similar activities at the same
                    time. And at least some Anti-Slavery Friends, such as Enoch Macy of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and John Swain of <placeName>

            <p>Such a conclusion, however, faced two difficulties. First, the Friends from east <placeName>

                    such a sample is probably too small to be a basis for generalization. As for Friends with origins in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Guilford County</region>
                    </placeName>, they were numerous in both monthly meetings, and in fact most of those from <placeName>

                    </placeName> did <hi rend="i">not</hi> become abolitionists: they were 135 of 231 adults in the

                    </placeName> are also not especially meaningful. The <placeName>

                    </placeName> Manumission Society (the state's antislavery organization, formed in 1816) and

                    </placeName> were gradualist groups that embraced colonization—in short, their attitudes
                    were closer to the ideas of the most conservative of the Indiana "Body" in the
                    1840s. It is not surprising that the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Manumission Society included among its members men like Elijah Coffin, the clerk of
                    Indiana Yearly Meeting, and the prominent minister Jeremiah Hubbard, who were both inveterate
                    opponents of abolition with colonization sympathies.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it is difficult to find any clear relationship between previous residence and antislavery
                    principles. It may have been a <hi rend="i">sine qua non</hi> for Anti-Slavery Friends to have had
                    some firsthand knowledge of slavery; virtually all of the abolitionists had roots in piedmont <placeName>

                    </placeName>. But then so did most of those who remained with the "Body." And
                    certain groups—Friends from eastern <placeName>

                    </placeName> and those born in the North—found little that was attractive in the

            <p>The timing of migration, the fourth social factor tested, also revealed little, as statistics in
                    table 4 show. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Duck Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName>, there was some indication that timing was important: of forty-one adult Anti-Slavery
                    Friends, thirty, or about 75 percent, had come north after 1831. In contrast, almost 90 percent of
                    the "Body" Friends had arrived before 1831. It is possible that the Hinshaw and
                    Wright families who, as will be seen, made up most of the membership of the Anti-Slavery group, had
                    witnessed the reaction to Nat Turner's Rebellion, which may have played a part in their
                    radicalization. But in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the timing of migration was remarkably similar for both groups—about three
                    quarters of each had come north before 1830.</p>
            <p>Closely related was age at the time of the move north; could it be that direct contact with slavery,
                    or the memory of it, was crucial in motivating Anti-Slavery Friends, and that
                    "Body" Friends lacked such memories? Again, Anti-Slavery Friends had had such
                    contact—findings in table 5 show that the overwhelming majority had lived in the South
                    long enough to be conscious of the institution. Yet this is also true of a majority of
                    "Body" Friends. It is equally valid to say that the overwhelming majority of
                    Friends in the two monthly meetings with memories of the South did not become abolitionists.</p>
            <p>The fifth variable, age, proved more helpful in explaining the separation. Certain patterns did
                    emerge, showing that abolition appealed most to young and least to older Friends. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the oldest of Anti-Slavery Friends, Elias Jessup, was forty-eight in 1842. The rest of
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName> separatists were rather evenly distributed from age twenty to forty-five. (See table
                    6.) The situation at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Duck Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName> was slightly different. Some older Friends did separate; the eldest, Jesse Wright, Sr.,
                    was seventy-three at the time of separation. But there, as at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the overwhelming majority of Anti-Slavery Friends was under age
                    forty-five—at least thirty-one of forty-two. Overall, however, the age distribution of
                    Anti-Slavery Friends reflects the age distribution of the two meetings, and in every age group, the
                    overwhelming majority chose to remain with the "Body."</p>
            <p>Family ties, the sixth variable, did produce some notable patterns in both communities and at first
                    glance seemed to explain some of the patterns of separation. As statistics in tables 7 and 8 show,
                    family ties and a high degree of kinship solidarity were striking among both
                    "Body" and Anti-Slavery Friends. In the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName> "Body," about 7 percent (twenty adults) consisted of the families of
                    the brothers Eli and Nathan Gause with their spouses and children. Another 7 percent (nineteen
                    adults) was made up of the families of Stephen Macy, Sr., and his brother Thaddeus, who had died in <placeName>

                    (1786–1870). If Dempsey Reese, the illegitimate son of Stephen Presnall's wife
                    Hannah is included in this kinship group, it accounts for about 13 percent of the monthly
                    meeting's membership after the separation. The wife of Daniel Presnall was Pleasant Modlin,

                    added—Hiatts, Stanleys, and Pickerings—the total comes to almost two-thirds of

                    cousins, grandsons of Isaac and Catherine (Stanton) White. Family connections may explain how they

                    "Body" families and in the case of the latter two daughters whose husbands were
                    not Friends. Only the Bowmans were fractured by the separation of their sister Annis Hinshaw, the
                    wife of Benjamin, along with two Wilson brothers who took opposing sides and three Willits sisters
                    who left behind their father and stepmother. (One wonders if this might somehow be related to the
                    fact that their stepmother had been a Stanley.) At <placeName>

                    family groups, accounting for 119 adults, produced only 4 Anti-Slavery Friends.</p>
            <p>The nature of this kinship solidarity, however, was complex, not lending itself either to patriarchal
                    or matriarchal characterizations. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Duck Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName>, of the twenty-four families or parts, all but three were related to other Anti-Slavery
                    Friends there. In ten cases this connection was through the husband, in ten through the wife, and in
                    one through both. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName> Anti-Slavery families were a bit more lopsided in their ties. Of the fifteen families
                    or parts there, four had no ties to other Anti-Slavery Friends, while in the case of seven it was
                    through the husband and but four through the wife. But it would be wrong to see this community as a
                    patriarchal world in which women were left with no choices except those made for them by male
                    relatives. The wives of Elias Jessup, Vierling Kersey, and Peter Pearson at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName> all remained with the "Body" when their husbands joined Anti-Slavery
                    Friends. It is reasonable to think that the decisions of Benedict and William R. Macy, the two adult
                    sons of Enoch and Nancy Macy, to remain with the "Body" were affected by the
                    prominence of their wives' families, the Gordons and Dickses, among the
                    "Body." The same sorts of influences may explain why John and Cyrus Hinshaw, the
                    sons of Benjamin and Annis at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Duck Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName>, remained with the "Body": their wives were daughters of Rebecca
                    (Lamb) Ratliff and Cadwallader Pitts, respectively, both elders among "Body"
                    Friends. A striking case of a woman who made up her own mind was Miriam (Macy) Baldwin, the widowed,
                    childless aunt of William, Enoch, and Nathan Macy. She made her home with Nathan and Jane (Wilson)
                    Macy while they leaned toward joining Anti-Slavery Friends and attended their meetings. In poor
                    health, she had no way of going to meeting unless her nephew took her in a wagon, which forced her
                    to meet with separatists. Yet sure that the leaders of the "Body" were the
                    ultimate repository of religious wisdom, she refused to join Anti-Slavery Friends. In addition,
                    there were apparent cases of men being drawn to Anti-Slavery Friends by their wives. The only child
                    of Benjamin and Annis Hinshaw to separate with them was their daughter Ann with her husband Thomas
                    Cox. At least three daughters of Jesse Wright, Sr., with their husbands followed their parents.

                    after 1842, marrying them in the Anti-Slavery meeting and thus forcing them to face disownment by
                    the "Body."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While these sorts of family connections must mean something, they do not explain everything. Take for
                    example William and Enoch Macy—their brothers Nathan and Solomon remained behind with the
                    "Body," as did their sister Anna after considerable soul searching; the two were
                    step-brothers of Elijah Coffin himself. None of Enoch Macy's adult children separated with
                    him and, as has been shown, even the wives of three <placeName>

                    </placeName> separatists did not join their husbands. Walter and Rebecca Edgerton's family
                    ties all should have inclined them toward the "Body." Walter's brother
                    Joseph was not only one of the most influential ministers in <placeName>

                    locust, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar" was "ready to eat up every green
                    thing." One of the weapons that the Meeting for Sufferings had used in its attack on
                    abolition in 1841 was the printing and distribution of an essay by the <placeName>

            <p>Family, then, played a role in the decisions of at least some of these Quakers in how to respond to
                    the Anti-Slavery split. But it does not explain the decisions of all. The ultimate answer to the
                    question of motive lies in an examination of the relationship of the two sides with their meetings
                    and their attitudes toward the Discipline that defined what Quakerism was.</p>
            <p>Anti-Slavery Friends rhetoric provides an important clue. Antebellum Indiana Quakers lived in a world
                    circumscribed by the elaborate body of custom and tradition embodied in the Discipline. Aside from

                    Discipline. Indeed, few defenders were more rigorous in its application or in devotion to it. After
                    the separation, Anti-Slavery Friends continued to use the old Indiana Yearly Meeting Discipline with
                    but two changes—no one under complaint was to take part in business meetings, and no
                    Friend was to vote for a slaveholder. Anti-Slavery Friends had no desire to live outside its
                    guidance. As Huldah Wickersham, a young Friend in another <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Henry County</region>
                    </placeName> meeting wrote, "Our anti-slavery principles had not destroyed our love for
                    religious society, nor our desire to watch over one another for good; but seeing we were altogether
                    denied religious privileges, there was no other alternative left us." In other words, one
                    could not be a true Friend without participating in the affairs of the society, and the actions of
                    the yearly meeting made that impossible. Charles Osborn exhorted the separatists in 1842:
                    "Let all our Friends who are virtually cut off from the communion and fellowship of Society
                    … still bear in mind that they are acting in strict accordance with the spirit of the
                    Discipline and with the Gospel of Christ, and that they ought not to be terrified and driven back
                    because of church censure."<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, Anti-Slavery Friends saw the very purity of the Society of Friends threatened. As the
                    conference that founded the new society proclaimed, there was "a universal liability in all
                    associations, both civil and religious, to deterioration and corruption." Declension was
                    the only possible explanation for the actions of Indiana Yearly Meeting against the abolitionists.
                    Now a "reformation" was necessary, but, with the loss of their positions and right
                    to participate effectively in business meetings, there was no hope for success. So their sole choice
                    was to separate and to hope that as a separate body they could lead Friends back to the Light.
                    Paradoxically, in order to uphold the whole of the Discipline, these Quakers violated part of its
                        letter.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this urge toward reformation, these Friends had precedents from the Quaker past. In the 1750s and
                    1760s the favorite prophet of Anti-Slavery Friends, John Woolman, had helped to lead a reformation
                    movement that had tightened the Discipline and given it the form that molded the lives of Indiana
                    Quakers. Again, in the 1820s, other Friends, this time led by Elias Hicks, had seen corruption and
                    outside influences creeping anew into the society and so had sought to purge the society of them. In
                    the first case, the reformers were successful and permanently changed the course of Quaker history.
                    The second had led its proponents, the Hicksites, <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Thus, one would expect to find that Anti-Slavery Friends at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Duck Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName> were Friends concerned about upholding the rigor of the Discipline, active in the
                    affairs of the society, and skeptical about the encroachment of outside forces, all of which were
                    confirmed. An examination of the minutes of the two monthly meetings showed that the backdrop to the
                    separation at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Duck Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a bitter controversy from 1834 to 1837 over the proper understanding of Quaker
                    doctrine. It also demonstrated that Anti-Slavery Friends were not powerless and disfranchised before
                    the separation—they held offices and were active in the society out of proportion to
                    their numbers. Indeed, close study of the records suggested that Anti-Slavery Friends were, as a
                    group, more devoted to strict observance of the Discipline than were members of the
                    "Body."</p>
            <p>The separation at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Duck Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName> took place in a monthly meeting with an almost uniquely troubled history. It had been
                    badly split by the Hicksite separation in 1828; one member left declaring that "Elias Hicks
                    [the leader of the Hicksites] is as good a man as Jesus Christ and that a certain approved minister
                    aught to be killed off." In the mid-1830s, new difficulties festered. Their source is
                    obscure, but hints suggest that the controversy pitted primitivists opposed to innovation against
                    Friends in sympathy with the yearly meeting's leadership, which was moving in an
                    increasingly evangelical direction that emphasized points of agreement with other denominations and
                    deemphasized Quaker peculiarities. In the fall of 1835, a proposal to set up a Sunday School, or
                    "First Day School for Scriptural Instruction," as Friends referred to it, died
                    because of lack of unity in the monthly meeting. A year later, the monthly meeting's
                    committee on education reported that it was so badly divided that it was impossible to keep up the
                    monthly meeting's school in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greensboro</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At the same time, the routine matter of appointing a new overseer dragged on for four
                    months, stalled by disagreement over the right person. Doctrine was also an issue. A quarterly
                    meeting committee of weighty Friends reported late in the summer of 1837 that the ministers and
                    elders of the monthly meeting were "in unity" with the yearly meeting, but that
                    "a number of the members … stood opposed to the order of our society."
                    At issue was a controversy over the nature of the resurrection (traditionalist Friends said that it
                    was purely spiritual, while evangelical Quakers were coming to argue that physical bodies would be

                    a prominent English Quaker minister, aggravated. In August, 1837, Whitewater Quarterly Meeting
                    ordered that <placeName>

            <p>The significance of this struggle is that the losers appear to have been those who five years later
                    became Anti-Slavery Friends. The most notable was Seth Hinshaw, the monthly meeting treasurer. He
                    had not only been vocal in the doctrinal controversy, but when the monthly meeting was laid down, he
                    responded by circulating a manuscript that <placeName>

                    exciting disunity and discord among Friends." Hinshaw backed down, but another <placeName>

                    Henry Lamb, who, over the "repeated objections" of the elders and overseers, had
                    been preaching in Clear Spring Meeting. Lamb had close ties with Seth Hinshaw—they came

                    ways. Attempts to establish First Day and monthly meeting schools failed. Then in the fall of 1842
                    the monthly meeting found itself split again over a complaint that Eli Stafford, an overseer and
                    active Friend, was guilty of "defamation and detraction." Once more, the quarterly
                    meeting intervened. The case was still under deliberation when the separation began.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

                    ex-Quakers who had been disowned after the marriage, suggesting that these were families in which
                    abiding by the judgment of the meeting was not a special concern. Typical was Thomas Newby, whose
                    wife Sarah was active in the monthly meeting's affairs. He had been read out of Back Creek

                    left behind not only bad debts but a generally un-Friendly reputation. The rest of the thirty-nine
                    consisted of families in which a husband or wife had "married contrary to
                    discipline," meaning that they were Friends married in a non-Quaker ceremony and, unlike
                    their spouses, had been unwilling to "condemn their misconduct" or make an apology

                    their lives. In most cases (60 of 72) it was for common marriage offenses. But others who were still
                    members in 1842 had records that might be described as "colorful." Richard
                    Ratliff, Jr., formerly an elder and one of the meeting's most active members, had actually
                    been disowned in 1837 for fathering an illegitimate child, although he had regained his membership
                    three years later. Daniel Presnall had feuded with the monthly meeting for two years over the poor
                    committee's treatment of his stepmother. Charges of slander, profanity, and drunkenness
                    were proffered against him in response. His brother John was pulled in as well, accused of
                    "vague testimony," "slanderous accusation," contradictory
                    statements, and making threats. John Presnall's son-in-law Henry Lewelling (a nephew of
                    Thomas Newby the cowkiller) was at the same time forced to acknowledge his "malicious and
                    unchristian disposition toward one of his neighbors" and "use of an expression
                    shocking to Christian feelings." And, of course, when the separation took place still

                    the widow of Isaac, and Nancy (Rayl) Macy, the wife of Enoch, had been overseers. Isaac White, who
                    died in 1840, had been an elder, clerk of the quarterly meeting, and a member of the Meeting for

            <p>At its most basic level, of course, discord was a contest over power. Anti-Slavery Friends justified

                    become abolitionists, and most of the yearly meeting found that threatening.</p>
            <p>What, then, do the experiences of these communities reveal about the abolitionist movement,
                    especially in Indiana, and about Quakerism? The experiences show us that among these Friends, at
                    least, the decision to become an abolitionist was not a function of wealth or
                    property—economically, Anti-Slavery Friends were a cross section of their communities.
                    Nor was abolition a function of previous residence or length of time in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Duck Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Age does seem to have been a factor; abolition apparently held little appeal for
                    Friends born before 1795. Complex kinship ties connected abolitionist families, but there were
                    numerous exceptions to this rule. What quantitative work does show is that, by and large,
                    Anti-Slavery Friends were those who were committed to strict observance of the Discipline,
                    regulating their lives by the peculiarities of Quakerism, defending the traditional doctrines of
                    Friends against change.</p>
            <p>Such observance was a matter of individual conscience, and thus one is drawn to something that
                    historians can never hope to recapture completely—moral choice. Scholars can reconstruct
                    many of the elements of the environment in which these Quakers lived and can look at the
                    declarations in which they corporately explained their behavior; in a few cases, they can even
                    examine personal statements. But chroniclers of the past cannot recapture the individual conscience
                    of each Friend, and even if they could somehow question each individually, it is difficult to see
                    whether the feat would reveal much more. True, the upbringing of all as Quakers no doubt predisposed
                    them to antislavery, and moral values are undoubtedly shaped in large part by family; but
                    environment cannot be seen as a major causative factor. Decisions about separation are explicable
                    ultimately only by individual conscience.</p>

            </byline>
            <p>Abraham Lincoln was fond of poetry. As a young man, he memorized and recited the best-known poems of
                    Robert Burns, admired Lord Byron, and cultivated a taste for William Shakespeare that would last
                    throughout his life. Perhaps more than any other president, the self-educated Lincoln invoked his
                    familiarity with English verse, particularly the plays of Shakespeare, as a means of dealing with
                    the pressures and burdens of office. But his favorite poem, which he would recite alongside passages
                    from <hi rend="sup">Hamlet,</hi> was so obscure that until the last months of his life he never knew
                    it in an authoritative text or even knew the name of its author.</p>
            <p>"Mortality" by the Scottish poet William Knox is better known by its first line,
                    "O why should the spirit of mortal be proud?" but it is safe to say it is only
                    known or remembered at all in association with Abraham Lincoln. This was true even in
                    Lincoln's life-time, when he was himself sometimes identified as the poem's
                    author, an attribution he found flattering. "Beyond all question, I am not the
                    author," he wrote to a correspondent. "I would give all I am worth, and go in
                    debt, to be able to write so fine a piece as I think that is."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Judging
                    by the number of times he is reported to have praised it, recited it, and dictated or copied it out
                    for friends during the last twenty years of his life, it seems reasonable to conclude with David C.
                    Mearns that this obscure poem "had a special meaning for Abraham Lincoln."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Lincoln's recitation of "Mortality" must have been extremely effective, to
                    judge by the reactions of witnesses. One of the most revealing accounts is provided by Francis B.
                    Carpenter, who engaged Lincoln in literary conversation while painting his portrait in the White
                    House. Carpenter described an evening spent with Lincoln in his study, where the president began
                    talking about Shakespeare and then read several of his favorite passages, something he did often and
                    with great effect. "Relapsing into a sadder strain," Carpenter wrote, "he
                    laid the book aside, and leaning back in his chair, said, ‘There is a poem that has been
                    a great favorite with me for years, to which my attention was first called when a young man, by a
                    friend, and which I afterward saw and cut from a newspaper, and carried in my pocket, till by
                    frequent reading I had it by heart. I would give a great deal,’ he added, ‘to
                    know who wrote it, but I never could ascertain.’ Then, half closing his eyes, he repeated
                    the poem, ‘Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?’"<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Carpenter's reaction was typical of Lincoln's listeners: he
                    was surprised and delighted, and he asked for a copy of the text.</p>
            <p>Unlike the special meaning of "Mortality" for Abraham Lincoln, the poem's
                    meanings are not at all obscure. Its basic theme—that life is fleeting and death
                    inevitable—is modulated in each of its fourteen quatrains and is accented by the framing
                    question of the first and last lines:<quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>O why should the spirit of mortal be proud! Like a swift flying meteor—a fast
                            flying cloud— A flash of the lightning—a break of the wave, He passeth
                            from life to his rest in the grave.</p>
                        <p> The leaves of the Oak, and the Willow shall fade, Be scattered around, and together be laid.
                            And the young and the old, and the low and the high, Shall moulder to dust, and together
                            shall lie.</p>
                        <p>The infant a mother attended and loved— The mother that infant's
                            affection who proved The husband that mother and infant who blest, Each—all are
                            away to their dwellings of rest.</p>
                        <p>The maid on whose brow, on whose cheek, in whose eye Shone beauty and pleasure—her
                            triumphs are by; And alike from the memory of the living erased And the memory of mortals,
                            who loved her and praised—</p>
                        <p>The hand of the King, that the scepter hath borne, The brow of the priest that the mitre hath
                            worn, The eye of the Sage, and the heart of the Brave, Are hidden, and lost in the depth of
                            the grave—</p>

                    of Ecclesiastes, its Old Testament fatalism is unremitting and notably unrelieved by any suggestion
                    of an after-life. The fate of humankind—low or high, young or old—is that of
                    the leaves: both "shall moulder to dust." Human joy and grief, love and scorn, are
                    all mere repetitions of one's forebears and come to nothing. The predominant fact of life
                    is death. Pride in so transient a thing as a mortal is obviously misplaced.</p>
            <p>There can be little doubt that there was a connection between Lincoln's affinity for
                    "Mortality" and his recurrent melancholy. Indeed, one of the most conspicuous
                    features of Lincoln's personal demeanor was his frequent lapses into moods of profound
                    depression. He seems to have been subject to these spells from an early date, though he probably
                    attempted to disguise them at first. He told a fellow legislator in his <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">New Salem</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>, days "that although he appeared to enjoy life rapturusly[,]
                    Still he was the victim of terrible melancholly. He sought Company and indulged in fun and hilarity
                    without restraint, or Stint as to time[.] Still when by himself, he told me that he was so overcome
                    with mental depression, that he never dare carry a knife in his pocket."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Albert J. Beveridge noted that those who rode the circuit with Lincoln all referred to these
                    moods. "Everybody observed his absymal sadness. His gloom was not periodical and succeeded
                    by weeks of brightness, but was made manifest every day, yet interwoven with hours <list type="footnotes">

                    humor following one another like cloud and sunshine in a day of doubtful storm."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Jesse W. Weik thought these reports must be exaggerated, so he made a point of
                    questioning those who knew Lincoln best: John T. Stuart, James H. Matheny, James C. Conkling, Samuel
                    H. Treat, David Davis, Leonard Swett, Henry C. Whitney, and others. Their responses convinced Weik
                    "that men who never saw him could scarcely realize this tendency to
                        melancholy."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether Lincoln was seriously suicidal when he told Robert Wilson that he dared not carry a
                    pocketknife is not certain, but the association of his despondent moods with the contemplation of
                    death would eventually become evident. His closest friends were concerned for his safety as well as
                    his sanity when he lapsed into despondency after the death of Ann Rutledge. And the agony of his
                    emotional crisis over his engagement to Mary Todd caused him to contemplate death and possibly even
                    suicide as a remedy. But his temporary moods were more than tinged with morbidity; as Beveridge has
                    pointed out, they were "strongly colored by apprehension of personal disaster.
                    ‘Billy, I fear that I shall meet with some terrible end,’ he said to his
                    partner William H. Herndon upon coming out of one of these fits of dejection."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is notable here is that these moods or spells were often associated with a recurrence to poetry.
                    Though Lincoln's stories were known for their humor, his favorite poems were most often
                    sad. His attraction for Oliver Wendell Holmes's "The Last Leaf" was such
                    that some regarded it as his favorite, particularly the fourth stanza:<quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The mossy marbles rest On lips that he has pressed In their bloom; And the names he loved to

                    </quote> Lincoln told Carpenter: "For pure pathos, in my judgment, there is nothing finer
                    than those six lines in the English language!"<hi rend="sup">9</hi> He also evinced a

            <p>But the poem most closely associated with Lincoln's melancholy by those who knew him was
                    Knox's "Mortality," a title so little recognized that the poem is almost
                    always referred to by its first line, "O why should the spirit of mortal be

                    on some subject, and with the saddest expression I have ever seen in a human being's
                        eyes."<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Weldon remembered that on one of these occasions Lincoln
                    "quoted aloud and at length the poem called
                        ‘Immortality.’"<hi rend="sup">13</hi> During his presidency,
                    Lincoln recited and praised the poem so often that it was sometimes reprinted and attributed to him.
                    By then it had taken on a special importance for Lincoln, for he is reported to have told a group of
                    friends that the poem was his "constant companion; indeed, I may say it is continually
                    present with me, as it crosses my mind whenever I have relief from anxiety."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>Lincoln's law partner and biographer, William H. Herndon, thought he had discovered the
                    special meaning that "Mortality" held for Lincoln. In gathering information on the

                    </placeName>, Herndon unexpectedly came across the story of Lincoln's tragic love affair
                    with Ann Rutledge, something he had previously known nothing about. From two dozen informants
                    Herndon gathered overwhelming testimony that Lincoln not only courted and became engaged to Rutledge
                    but that he became temporarily deranged with grief after her death in 1835.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

                    </placeName>, Herndon conceived a bold hypothesis. "I've found out the history of
                    the poem called ‘Immortality,’" Herndon wrote to a friend.
                    "The facts which I shall reveal, for the first time in the world, throw a footlight on Mr.
                    Lincoln's sad life …."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The footlight came in a lecture Herndon delivered in <placeName>

                    </placeName> on November 16, 1866, which he had printed for distribution in advance and entitled <hi rend="i">"Abraham Lincoln. Miss Ann Rutledge. <placeName>

                        </placeName>. Pioneering, and THE Poem."</hi> In a "pre-Raphaelite"
                    mode of address as eccentric as his title, Herndon speculated that Lincoln's famous
                    melancholy was precipitated by the death of Ann Rutledge and that "O why should the spirit
                    of mortal be proud?" shown to him at the time, became fixed in his mind and was thereafter
                    recited in memoriam of Ann, the only woman he ever loved. This hypothesis and other aspects of the
                    lecture offended the Lincoln family and much of his nine-teenth-century audience and consequently
                    earned Herndon a name for irresponsible speculation that continues to this day. As John Y. Simon has
                    put it, Herndon had "grossly mishandled a major incident in the Lincoln story,"
                    from which "neither [his] reputation nor that of Ann Rutledge ever recovered."<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his biography, published twenty-three years later, Herndon put forward a more moderate version of
                    his theory: "It was shortly after this [Lincoln's derangement at the death of Ann
                    Rutledge] that Dr. Jason Duncan placed in Lincoln's hands a poem called
                    ‘Immortality.’ … He committed these lines to memory, and any
                    reference to or mention of Miss Rutledge would suggest them, as if ‘to celebrate a grief
                    which lay with continual heaviness on his heart.’ There is no question that from this
                    time forward Mr. Lincoln's spells of melancholy became more intense than ever."<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Herndon had thus satisfied himself that the significance of
                    Lincoln's favorite poem and his peculiar affinity for it lay deep in his great
                    partner's psyche, that it bore a direct relationship to the traumatic death of his first
                    love, Ann Rutledge, and that the poem's hold on Lincoln was therefore datable from shortly
                    after her <list type="footnotes">

                    collected reliable testimony that lent it credence. The most telling was Isaac Cogdal's
                    reported conversation with Lincoln in 1860–1861 in which the president-elect admitted not
                    only that he had loved Ann dearly but that he still thought of her often.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> As
                    David C. Mearns allowed, if we can accept the reality of Lincoln's romance with Ann
                    Rutledge, Lincoln's attachment to the poem is thus "perfectly
                        explained."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But even though recent scholarship has demonstrated that basic elements of the Rutledge romance can
                    be confidently accepted, there are other factual difficulties that make Herndon's theory
                    altogether unlikely. His biographer, David Donald, thought Herndon had no reason to think that
                    Lincoln had known "Mortality" at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but he was mistaken.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> The key to Herndon's theory is the
                    role of Jason Duncan, the man that Lincoln had identified as the person who first showed him the
                    poem as a young man.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Herndon had no idea who Duncan was or how or <figure/>
                    when he was acquainted with Lincoln, but by a persistence that was characteristic of his

            <p>In his 1866 lecture, Herndon said Lincoln had been shown the poem in September, 1833, and that he
                    then took it up two years later at the time of Ann's death. What evidence Herndon had for
                    this is not apparent, but in his biography, as seen, he changed the time of Lincoln's first
                    acquaintance with the poem to after Rutledge's death in 1835.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> None of
                    the surviving documentation supports either conclusion. Nor does there seem to be any testimony to
                    support Herndon's contention in his lecture that Lincoln began reciting the poem to his
                    friends at this time. Often abused for taking positions that subsequently proved to be fully
                    warranted, Herndon's strong intuition about Lincoln's attachment to "THE
                    POEM" seems here to have caused him to overreach his evidence.</p>
            <p>A series of letters that Herndon may never have seen puts "Mortality" and
                    Lincoln's attraction for it in a different light. In 1846 and 1847 Lincoln sent four
                    letters to a lawyer and political associate, Andrew Johnston of <placeName>

                    dated February 24, 1846, Lincoln included the text of "Mortality," which Johnston
                    had previously requested. But Lincoln seems to have had a further motive for writing. "By
                    the way," he asked Johnston, "how would you like to see a piece of poetry of my
                    own making?"<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Johnston must have expressed interest, for each of the
                    next three letters contained what Lincoln described as a separate division or canto of a longer poem

            <p>Lincoln had been something of a poet much of his life. In a provocative essay, "Lincoln and

                    lines; he was known as a versifier in those days, and the spelling and grammar are certainly
                        original."<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Lincoln was indeed known as such in his boyhood in
                    Indiana, and these verses sound what would become, with the mature Lincoln, a very familiar theme.
                    Lincoln himself recited some of his Indiana verses to his friends in <placeName>

            <p>Though very little of Lincoln's verse survives, Gibson Harris testified that when he was a
                    clerk in Lincoln's law office between 1845 and 1847, he found in a drawer a substantial
                    manuscript of what appeared to be original poetry in Lincoln's hand. As he remembered,
                    these "stanzaed effusions … were all, or nearly all, iambics and pensive in
                    tone." Lincoln would not discuss them, but Herndon told Harris, "Yes, he has
                    sometimes scribbled verses, I believe, but he seems unwilling to have it known."<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Lincoln's letters to Johnston of this same period seem to represent

            <p>In the second letter to Johnston, dated April 18, 1846, Lincoln combined an explanation of what he
                    knew about "Mortality" with an account of the circumstances in which he was led to
                    compose the original canto he was sending to Johnston. After denying authorship of
                    "Mortality," he told Johnston: "I met it in a straggling form in a
                    newspaper last summer, and I remember to have seen it once before, about fifteen years ago, and this

                    circumstances. In the fall of 1844, thinking I might aid some to carry the State of Indiana for Mr.
                    Clay, I went into the neighborhood in that State in which I was raised, where my mother and only
                    sister were buried, and from which I had been absent about fifteen years. That part of the country
                    is, within itself, as unpoetical as any spot of earth; but still, seeing it and its objects and
                    inhabitants aroused feelings in me which were certainly poetry; though whether my expression of
                    those feeling is poetry is quite another question."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> The original
                    verses thus described constitute a forty-line poem beginning "My childhood's home
                    I see again."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The association of "Mortality" with his own poem about his return to southwest
                    Indiana can hardly have been accidental. Lincoln's poem begins with the pleasures of memory
                    and moves toward a dramatic recognition of death as the principal force in the passage of time.
                    Memory, the poem says, purifies and transforms the past:<quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>And, freed from all that's earthly vile, Seem hallowed, pure, and bright, Like

                  </p>
                    </quote> But to come to terms with the reality of the present, the poet is forced to acknowledge the
                    overwhelming presence of death.<quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The friends I left that parting day, How changed, as time has sped! Young childhood grown,
                            strong manhood gray, And half of all are dead.</p>
                        <p>I hear the loved survivors tell How nought from death could save, Till every sound appears a

                            Matthew Gentry; the other, a description of a frontier bear hunt. Though separate and
                            sufficiently distinct from "My childhood home I see again," both of these
                            pieces were apparently conceived as parts of a retrospective poem about Indiana, which may

                    straggling form" may mean that he remembered its proper form from his previous acquaintance
                    with it, the implication of what Lincoln told Johnston seems to be that he had taken little
                    cognizance of the poem in the fifteen intervening years. Herndon convinced himself that Lincoln
                    recited it frequently from the time of Ann Rutledge's death, though Lincoln's
                    closest friend of the ensuing years, Joshua F. Speed, may not even have recognized it.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> But the second time around, in the summer of 1845, there is no question that
                    "Mortality" made a profound impression on Lincoln. Gibson Harris remembered that
                    in his two years at Lincoln's law office, which began in September, 1845, it was
                    Lincoln's "favorite of favorites." "Many a time at the office
                    did he recite this poem, in whole or in part; for a while I actually thought he had written it, so
                    nearly did it resemble, in tone and meter, one of several compositions of his own that I had found
                    in the office desk."<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

            <p>The electioneering trip to his unpoetical childhood neighborhood in Indiana in October, 1844, is an
                    obscure event in Lincoln biography, and very little is known of what transpired, except that he gave
                    some speeches and renewed old friendships.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> But something important seems to
                    have come out of the Indiana experience, and the rediscovery of the poem
                    "Mortality" the following summer may have crystalized it in Lincoln's
                    mind and given it expression. He had come very far in the world since leaving Indiana in 1830. From
                    his hardscrabble beginnings with nothing to encourage education, he had risen to surprising heights.
                    He had become educated; he had gained a profession; and he had achieved, by his political efforts, a
                    measure of recognition. As Benjamin Thomas observes: "He had been disciplined by marriage
                    and family responsibilities and by four years of association with Stephen T. Logan. He had regained
                    his mental balance after the fiasco of <list type="footnotes">

                            clearly places the date well before the death of Ann Rutledge, which would have been only
                            ten years prior to Lincoln's rediscovery of the poem in the summer of 1845.</item>

                            down on the Ann Rutledge affair. See J. F. Speed to Herndon, September 13, 1866,

                    and political disappointments had had taught him patience and self-control. He had come to the front
                    in politics against strong and determined rivals."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> Of the man who
                    became his law partner about the time of this trip, Herndon says, "Mr. Lincoln had
                    unbounded and unlimited confidence in his own mental powers, he was himself and wholly self-reliant,
                    asking no man anything."<hi rend="sup">42</hi> What this confident and self-reliant man
                    encountered in his boyhood home in Indiana was probably as unexpected as it was
                    unforgettable—the humbling fact of his own mortality.</p>
            <p>This is not, of course, to say that Lincoln had never confronted the fact or the prospect of death
                    before 1844. He had endured devastating losses through the deaths of his mother, his only sister,
                    and his fiancée Ann Rutledge, and had contemplated self-destruction as a means of
                    escaping his torturous mental depression. But having survived these traumatic events and surmounted
                    the formidable obstacles of poverty, ignorance, and obscurity, his experience in Indiana in 1844
                    seems to have presented him with the reality of his <hi rend="i">own</hi> mortality in a new
                    perspective.</p>
            <p>The profound emotional effect that Lincoln felt on his visit to Indiana calls to mind the plight of
                    one of Lincoln's idols, Thomas Jefferson, when stationed for five years as a diplomat in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Replying to a correspondent whose letter had reported much local news, including the
                    death of some of his acquaintances, Jefferson conjures up a fate for himself that is almost exactly
                    that of Lincoln's: "Fancy to yourself," he tells his correspondent,
                    "a being who is withdrawn from his connections of blood, of marriage, or friendship, of
                    acquaintance in all their gradations, who for years should hear nothing of what has passed among
                    them, who returns again to see them and finds the one half dead. This strikes him like a pestilence
                    sweeping off the half of mankind. Events which had they come to him one by one and in detail he
                    would have weathered as other people do, when presented to his mind all at once are
                        overwhelming."<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Lincoln's beguilement with "Mortality" in the summer of 1845 was
                    prompted by what had happened to him on his trip to Indiana the previous fall, his poem "My
                    childhood home I see again" may be regarded as an autobiographical record of that incident.
                    It appears to be an enactment of why the spirit of mortal should not be proud. The poem's
                    most forceful passages are of the boyhood friends he expected to see and the startling changes <list type="footnotes">

                    manhood gray, / And half of all are dead." The poem tells how listening to the
                    "survivors" speak of those who have died magnifies the sense of mortality and
                    produces the sensation that every sound is a death knell, "And every spot a
                    grave." To visit old friends and familiar places is hardly to bask in the honors of the
                    present or even relive the pleasures of the past, for the poem ends:<quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I range the fields with pensive tread, And pace the hollow rooms, And feel (companion of the
                            dead) I'm living in the tombs.</p>
                    </quote> The former friends and neighbors by whom the moderately triumphant Lincoln had expected to
                    be greeted were greatly changed—and half of all were dead.</p>
            <p>Lincoln became a very different man in the course of the next twenty years, and yet his attachment to
                    "Mortality" remained; if anything, it deepened. One of the things that makes it
                    difficult to fathom this connection is the difference in sensibility between Lincoln's time
                    and today. Lincoln's taste was very much a product of the nineteenth century, with its
                    notorious appetite for sorrow and sentimentality artfully laid on. As a result, the poem that to a
                    twentieth-century reader may seem a "jingle" and a "tedious
                        dirge"<hi rend="sup">44</hi> was to Lincoln a very different thing. The anapestic meter
                    that the twentieth-century reader may regard as artificial and inappropriate to its subject, he
                    seems to have found soothing. Sentiments that may seem to later generations lugubrious or depressing
                    actually consoled him in times of anxiety and grief. Far from sounding trite or bathetic, this poem,
                    Lincoln told a friend, "sounded as much like true poetry as anything he had ever
                        heard."<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Lincoln got from this poem is not easy to specify, though it is undoubtedly related to his
                    chronic melancholy and his well-established preoccupation with death. By his own testimony, the poem
                    crossed his mind whenever he experienced "relief from anxiety."<hi rend="sup">46</hi> His eulogy on Zachary Taylor in 1850, which he concluded by quoting six stanzas of
                    "Mortality," yields further clues.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Immediately before
                    quoting these lines Lincoln observed: "The death of the late President may not be without
                    its use, in reminding us, that <hi rend="i">we,</hi> too, must die. Death, abstractly considered, is
                    the same with the high as with the low; but practically, we are not so much aroused to the
                    contemplation of our own mortal natures, by the fall <list type="footnotes">

            <p>At the time of his trip to Indiana in 1844, and perhaps in succeeding years as well, the one great
                    name that filled the mind of the inordinately ambitious and self-confident Abraham Lincoln was his
                    own. That half of all the people he had known as a boy (and were thus in a position to appreciate
                    his success) should have been claimed by death was a shock for which, as his autobiographical poem
                    suggests, he was wholly unprepared. As he confessed to his friend Johnston, seeing those things had
                    aroused strong feelings. The experience forced him to see himself not as the returning prodigal but
                    as a "companion of the dead." For a man who had once professed the
                    "doctrine of necessity" and was inclined toward fatalism, this unexpected
                    confrontation with mortality may have resulted in something like a revelation. Death was inevitable.
                    It was not, as his previous experience had led him to think, an unlucky misfortune for the victim or
                    an undeserved affliction for the bereft; it was rather an irreducible fact—the crowning
                    fact of all human striving, no matter how vaunted or satisfying or successful. Such a discovery was
                    not without its consolations, and these would prove even more useful later on. But the
                    prodigal's pride had been misplaced, and his mood was caught by a poem he realized he had
                    been shown fifteen years earlier, soon after leaving his childhood home in Indiana, but whose
                    meaning he had been unprepared by experience to appreciate.</p>
            <p>Seeing the inception of Lincoln's affinity for "Mortality" in this context
                    holds out the possibility of enhancing one's understanding of his development, for it helps
                    to explain how and in what circumstances a touchstone expression became firmly established in his
                    consciousness. From 1845 onwards, "Mortality" served as an emotional tonic for a
                    man subject to recurrent and virtually disabling melancholy. He recited it frequently for his
                    friends and invoked it as a means of relief from anxiety in times of despondency and grief. Its
                    appeal, to be sure, was partly aesthetic, but it must also have been grounded in an identification
                    with the basic imagery of the poem—fathers and sons, time, birth and death, and the
                    earth—imagery that James Hurt has argued is "thematically continuous"
                    in Lincoln's writings from the Lyceum speech of 1838 to the Gettysburg address.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> The poem was undoubtedly related to what <list type="footnotes">

                            to make the line "Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud" appear the
                            object of "ponder," as he believes was Lincoln's intention,
                            rather than as a title for the poem, as the newspaper rendered it.</item>

                    equal—[that] deepened [Lincoln's] compassion, forbearance, and ability to

            <p>Barr's role in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> was in reforming the community through prohibition of alcohol, through creation of a
                    Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), and through the formation of a refuge for
                    former prostitutes—all in keeping with Friends testimonies. Yet her vigor, her political
                    savvy, and her considerable organizational talents were gradually deemed excessive. Moreover, the
                    tactics she used to promote her main cause—temperance—were often of
                    questionable legality and bespoke a willingness to use almost any means to achieve the desired end.</p>
            <p>Barr first became prominent in <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>In the spring of 1911, wets counterattacked, circulating a petition for another election and
                    obtaining the requisite number of signatures. Even before the petition was presented, however, the
                    drys had begun to organize in opposition. Foremost among the dry forces was the Dry League, whose
                    president, Joseph A. Goddard, was a member of <placeName>

                    women supporters whose activities would supplement those of the Dry League.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The drys used the same strategy that had proven so effective two years earlier—mass
                    meetings with both local and outside speakers and a highly organized campaign to get their message
                    to residents. Barr played a leading role in influencing women. On April 6, she spoke at the Jackson
                    Street Christian Church to an enthusiastic audience of women and got a resolution passed promising
                    that the women would not vote for anyone who supported saloons (since women could not vote, they
                    would presumably influence those who could). Four days later the women drys had organized <list type="footnotes">

                            orthodox Quakers because the holiness influence rejected plain dress, silent meetings, and
                            pacifism, adopting a pastoral ministry. The first such meeting in Indiana was in <placeName>

                    headquarters and selected Barr as the group's president. Barr organized the voters of the

                    from <placeName>

                    saloons." On April 23 she attracted sixteen hundred women to a Sunday meeting held at the
                    Wysor Grand, a meeting she choreographed and over which she presided.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the wets struck back. On April 27, one of Barr's aides, Carrie D. Hageman, an executive
                    committee member of the Dry League, was taken to city court on charges of libel, based on her
                    statement, "As long as policemen are blind to conditions there will be blind
                    tigers." Hageman's defense was that the statement in question was a general one
                    obtained from Barr, who had used it in a half-dozen cities. The explanation evidently placated the
                    authorities, for Hageman was released.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Nevertheless, the dry campaign ended
                    with a spectacular parade the Saturday before the election. While Barr was not listed as a parade
                    official (Goddard was in charge), she had a prominent place, riding in a white carriage with Hageman
                    and Reba Richy, chair of the press bureau of the Dry League's auxiliary.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> The day before the election Barr spoke again at the Wysor Grand to her women's

            <p>In spite of defeat, Barr was still taking a leadership role in the larger community. One result of
                    the dry campaign was formation of an institution for young people that would provide alternatives to
                    the saloon. The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) got the nod, and in the summer of

                    building. The campaign raised two hundred thousand dollars, over half of it donated by the Balls,
                    which culminated in a visit by President William Howard Taft to congratulate the community on its
                    spirited citizens.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Although there was an effort underway to build a
                    corresponding institution for women, it had accomplished little.</p>
            <p>Barr changed all that. Using the same techniques she had wielded so effectively in the local option
                    election, she held a series of meetings to publicize the YWCA. First named the Young

                    Bunch to discuss the possibility.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Barr had pressed for the creation of the
                    post for several years because a policewoman would be, among other things, an instrument in
                    transforming prostitutes into reformed citizens.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> The results of the meeting
                    with Bunch were mixed; he agreed to appoint a woman to the force, but he would not tell his visitors
                    her name. When he did announce his selection, the woman he chose was Alfaretta Hart, wife of a <placeName>

                    the drys wanted—she was Catholic and wet. Furthermore, Hart had supported Bunch in the
                    campaign and, in a fiery speech at the Wysor Grand before the election, had attacked both
                    prohibition and the "corrupt society" that controlled <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Her appointment was announced two days after Barr and her group met with Bunch,
                    although she would not take office until early January. Before she had a chance to do so, the reform
                    coalition quickly attacked the appointment on two grounds: that the terms of her service made her
                    only a matron in charge of female prisoners and that her appointment should have been made by the
                    Board of Public Works, which was charged with selection and supervision of police, after the receipt
                    of twenty-five recommendations from local residents.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Barr was not sufficiently disaffected, however, to refuse the invitation of Bunch to offer the
                    invocation at the first meeting of the city council in January, 1914.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Later
                    that same week the mayor's actions raised the hopes of Barr and fellow reformers. On
                    January 9, police staged huge raids on "blind tigers," on drug stores selling
                    illicit drugs, and on houses of prostitution.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Barr had also become immediately
                    involved. On the night of the raids, she telephoned members of the police board, offering to speak
                    to the "fallen women." The following night, she chaired a meeting of several
                    reformers, including Reverend Edward Mason and Frank C. Ball. All agreed that a refuge for the women
                    who wished to abandon prostitution was needed. Barr had convinced them that "it was up to
                    the Christian people of <placeName>

                    from being thrown on the streets, either to starve or infect the community with scattered evil

                    "Friendly Inn." Because of Barr's early involvement she became president
                    and Mason became vice-president when the board was organized on January 21. By that time the board
                    had additional resources: Amos Whiteley, a local industrialist, had donated $300; Milford
                    H. Lyon's tablernacle collection had amounted to $175; and the Women's
                    Club, true to its promise, had given $120.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite early monetary support, the Friendly Inn was plagued with difficulties from the start; the
                    board was even unable to hire a full-time matron. More seriously the founders had hoped that former
                    prostitutes would come into the refuge willingly but were soon disappointed. They also knew that
                    there would be temptations to "backslide" on the part of those who did come. But
                    they had hoped to avoid these temptations by hiring a matron to control the home, by placing the
                    refuge in a secret location, and by close police supervision. They were unsuccessful, however. By
                    February 10, the evening newspaper reported that the Friendly Inn was closed while the red-light
                    district was again open.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Barr did not admit defeat. While the inn was struggling, she had traveled to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> to interview a prospective candidate for matron. When she returned, she learned of the
                    board's action to close the refuge and tried to reverse it. The board's rationale
                    was that since the town's regulation of brothels was lax, the refuge could not succeed
                    because of the temptations offered to its residents. When called upon to explain the opening of the
                    houses, city officials denied that any were open. Bunch even instructed two policemen to visit all
                    the sites raided. They reported back that no house was open.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Given such
                    reassurance by the mayor, Barr determined to reopen the refuge, although ultimately the inn sank
                    quietly from public view. There is no further mention of it again in newspapers, nor is there
                    evidence that it reformed any prostitutes. The Friendly Inn was one of Barr's least
                    successful endeavors.</p>
            <p>Barr's attention was quickly diverted to another election. On February 7, 1914, the drys
                    presented a petition for a local option election containing thirteen hundred names, one hundred more
                    than required.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Two weeks later the drys began an intensive campaign, again
                    utilizing the tactics from the previous election.</p>

            <p>In the dry campaign of 1914 Barr's role was much less conspicuous than in 1911. While she
                    spoke at meetings, she no longer was the organizer of women's branches of dry groups.
                    Furthermore, the wets ran a more aggressive campaign. Their most popular speaker was Hart,
                    Barr's former foe in the fight against prohibition. On March 4, Hart filled the Wysor Grand
                    to overflowing, with an additional 350 listeners compelled to sit on stage, hundreds crowding the
                    lobby, and others turned away. She delivered a scathing and sensational attack on the leaders of the
                    drys and accused them of being hypocrites who drank secretly, consorted with prostitutes, and
                    seduced young girls.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the election neared, the drys stepped up their campaign, organizing women in various precincts,
                    some to serve coffee and free lunches to those working the polls and others to check voter
                    registration. Poll watching was in response to rumors that wets had imported over one hundred
                    outsiders and settled them in rooming houses to flood the polls.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> The drys also
                    countered the claims of wets that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s power elite wanted to vote the town dry while still imbibing. Prohibitionist
                    lecturers spoke to employees of Warner Gear and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> Central, as well as to assembled machinists whose employers had released them for the
                    speeches. Barr spoke at Ball Brothers to what was evidently a hostile audience.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> The situation in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> was complicated by the normal division in law enforcement between a largely wet city
                    police force and a dry county sheriff. Election day was prickly as a near civil war erupted between
                    the two law enforcement agencies. When the election was over, the drys had won, but each side was
                    angry over the other's strongarm tactics.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

                    she indicated that her problems were a weak heart and a general breakdown that prevented her from
                    carrying out church routine. She promised to continue to preach until September 1 but planned to
                    spend most of her time north at her <geogName>Winona Lake</geogName> summer home, commuting to <placeName>

            <p>Why had Barr left? Was it really because of ill health? That is difficult to believe; she was only
                    thirty-seven and had been quite active with no hint of illness earlier that year. Furthermore, her
                    later career showed no signs of invalidism, for despite her poor health, Barr had apparently already
                    made future plans. On September 13, she joined Reverend Milford H. Lyon,<hi rend="sup">41</hi> who
                    also had a summer home in <geogName>Winona Lake</geogName>, on an evangelical crusade beginning in

                  <settlement type="city">Chillicothe</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>. Barr was in charge of the newly created women's
                    department and was quoted as saying that she was well-acquainted with evangelistic work, having
                    begun her career as an evangelist.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> Nevertheless, life on the evangelical trail
                    surely was more strenuous than life in an old manse.</p>
            <p>If illness was not the reason, several explanations are possible. Historian Anne Szopa speculates
                    that Barr's brief association with Democrats (and wets) Bunch and Hart in the aftermath of
                    the prostitutes' arrest may have ruined her credibility with dry leaders. Perhaps there was

                    leaders because of her Sabbitarianism.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Barr herself gave another reason. In
                    her book of sermons she indicated that she had become interested in interdenominational evangelism
                    in unconventional sites— garages, factories, and tabernacles—and had wanted to
                    reenter the field.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> But because her first duty was to her son, she remained in
                    pastoral work. When he went away to college, and with her husband's consent, she felt free
                    to become an evangelist again.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In spite of her departure, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> was important in Barr's development. There she had learned how to organize
                    women into effective pressure groups, how to align herself with powerful members of the community,
                    and how to cross party lines to coalesce with erstwhile political opponents. Although cognizant of
                    the power of her rhetoric, she had also learned how tough and resilient opposition could be. In one
                    of her later sermons, she noted that politics had a bad name because mayors in some cities had been
                    arrested for bad conduct and had not been impeached by irate citizens. She also claimed that in one
                    city in Indiana four dry workers were slandered and beaten to near death. These are obvious
                    references to the situation in <placeName>

                    World War I and that was an adjunct to the newly formed American Legion, and vice-chair of the
                    Republican State Committee, the first woman to fill the post. Her husband, meanwhile, had become
                    deputy state bank commissioner.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> And Barr's political activity had not
                    snuffed out her religious career. In July, 1920, she accepted a call to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Friends Church, which had been without a pastor for some time. Using her flashy
                    techniques she had considerable success in increasing the size and financial position of the church.
                    She even coined a motto for the church: "The Church for the Family and the Family for the
                    Church." She was pastor for almost two years, retiring on June 19, 1922, in a way quite
                    similar to the manner done in <placeName>

            <p>Barr, however, did not "retire" but instead moved more actively into politics. When
                    Indiana Governor Warren T. McCray selected her for vice-chair of the Republican State Committee in
                    1922, he also appointed Lawrence Lyons as state chairman of the Republican party (previously McCray

            <p>The reasons for Barr's and Lyon's involvement in the KKK lie in the history of the
                    Indiana Klan; Indiana was the first state north of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> to establish
                    a Klavern, on August 13, 1921,<hi rend="sup">52</hi> after which the Klan spread rapidly through the
                    state. In 1922, 6.4 percent of all Klan members lived in Indiana, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>; two years later the percentage was 40.2. The total number of Klan members in Indiana
                    is a matter of dispute; some estimate the total at about 125,000, while others place it at 500,000,
                    one-half the adult male population.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it became one of the most powerful political groups in the state, the Indiana Klan soon attracted
                    many drys and minsters to its ranks. Historian John Augustus Davis has indicated that a major
                    attraction was the problem of prohibition enforcement.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> The cooperation between
                    drys and the Klan operated in the state legislature. Edward S. Shumaker, superintendent of the
                    Anti-Saloon League and a dominant force in the Indiana General Assembly in the early 1920s,
                    cooperated with the Klan to push old-time religion and bone-dry prohibition among state
                        legislators.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> The enrollment of ministers was a calculated move by David C.
                    Stephenson, who instructed Kleagles to send him lists of ministers in the community. He would then
                    make them honorary members and tell them that he would require Klan members to attend. If the
                    sermons were favorable, donations would be forthcoming. As a result nine of ten Klan lecturers were
                    introduced as "reverend."<hi rend="sup">56</hi> Because of this emphasis the Klan
                    enrolled many Protestant ministers, particularly Baptists, Methodists, and Disciples of Christ. In
                    turn, notes <list type="footnotes">

                            the Klan for six weeks and announced his resignation from the KKK by a telegram to <hi rend="i">Tolerance,</hi> an anti-Klan newspaper. The circumstances of both leaving were
                            not made public, so the pressure exercised by the Indiana Republican Committee was not
                            measured. George R. Dale, <placeName>

                            against Governor Ed Jackson, who was on trial. McCray claimed Jackson offered him ten

                    </placeName>'s large Quaker community, "one of the oldest and most influential in
                    the state, showed no special immunity to the Klan." There, for example, 6.6 percent of the
                    Klan members were Quakers, while they represented 12.2 percent of the Klan members who indicated
                    religious membership.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> The organizer and most significant leader of the Klan in <placeName>

            <p>The Klan's appeal to Barr is obvious; liquor, political corruption, and prostitution were
                    old enemies. Her Methodist and Quaker heritage and her evangelical experience also must have
                    influenced her. In addition, she had always had a nativist strain, manifest in her sermons, despite
                    showing compassion for foreign workers in her <placeName>

                    the Klan's deserved reputation for coercion and intimidation. When it became publicly known
                    that she was a Klan member, Barr was forced to resign from the Indiana War Mothers in early 1923 as
                    well as from her position with the Republican party. In the announcement of her resignation as head
                    of the former no mention is made of her Klan attachment.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> George R. Dale, a

                    "women are proving the best supporters of the organization after having suggested their
                    joining." In addition, the Queens formed what Stephenson named his "poison

                    spread rumors about his opponents.<hi rend="sup">62</hi> On February 24, 1923, Barr signed an

                    lamented that one thousand more members were present but lacked the proper regalia. On August 25,
                    1923, the northern convention of the Klan met in <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s Goldthwaite Park, and Barr was present representing the national
                    organzation. Three months later, on November 17, 1923, the Klan held its most spectacular parade in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>

                    it also reflected Barr's ambition for greater things.</p>
            <p>The ceremonial aspect of Klandom was not an aberration, nor was Barr's participation new for

                    demonstrations, parades, and holiday celebrations, as well as more mundane social events, were in
                    fact the most frequent activities of individual Klan chapters, the means through which the average
                    member participated in the organization."<hi rend="sup">69</hi> But Barr sometimes
                    overstepped the bounds. At the end of the year, she and four Klansmen, including her son, tried

                    obtained in fees from the Klan. According to the suit, Barr had "naturalized" five
                    thousand members, had reported their entry into the Klan, but had failed to pay the Klan its dollar
                    for each. An additional forty thousand members had been enrolled but not reported, adding another
                    forty thousand dollars to the debt. Finally, the Klan estimated Barr owed between fifty-four and
                    sixty-seven thousand dollars for robes that she had supplied from a non-authorized source.<hi rend="sup">79</hi>

            <p>The news apparently did not trouble Barr; according to friends, she was not "worried the

                        leadership.<hi rend="sup">80</hi> The news did delight Barr's foe, Dale, who composed a

                    away from him, or her."<hi rend="sup">81</hi> Three weeks later, Dale reported that Barr
                    was again in trouble. Under a headline entitled "Dizzy Daisy Barr and Mrs. Shinn Grabbed
                    the Korn," he recounted how Josephine Shinn of <placeName>

            <p>A woman in a man's world, Daisy Douglas Barr consistently allied herself with the rich and
                    powerful: Frank C. Ball, Joseph Goddard, Milford H. Lyon, Warren T. McCray, David C. Stephenson,
                    Hiram Wesley Evans. At the same time, there was no doubt that she was her own woman. While men aided
                    her in gaining the public forum she needed, her success was in large part due to her skill as an
                    adroit organizer, an eloquent orator, and a symbol manipulator. Her major concerns were always the
                    same: ending the liquor traffic and protecting and nurturing young women. These concerns came from a
                    genuine religious conviction, not just from her Friends background but also from her Methodist
                    heritage. How much she was corrupted by materialism in her later career is a moot question. Like
                    some twentieth-century television evangelists, she claimed she became rich through God's
                    efforts. Furthermore, her Klan episode is not as startling as it appears at first glance. The
                    Klan's emphasis upon prohibition and on social purity, though mocked by actual practice,
                    must have appealed to Barr's own ideals. The nativism espoused by the Klan also struck a
                    familiar chord in Barr. Even the tactics—the public marches, the torchlight parades, the
                    mass meetings, the coercion, and the violence—had been anticipated by the dry campaigns

            <p>Alvin Nugent "Bo" McMillin seemed like the real thing. During a time when
                    journalists were trying to manufacture heroes for a hero-hungry public, Bo McMillin appeared to be
                    the genuine article. In 1921, before Bo was even out of college, Ralph Delahaye Paine, a popular
                    author of adolescent adventure and sports stories, wrote <hi rend="i">First Down <placeName>

                        </placeName>,</hi> a story based on the exploits of Bo McMillin. It was an inspirational novel
                    in which its hero, Bowman McMurray (Bo McMillin), is wounded when a German torpedo hits his ship
                    during the Great War, still manages to save his shipmates, recovers from his serious injuries, and
                    returns to America to lead his small <placeName>

                    </placeName> college to thrilling gridiron victories—all very stirring stuff for young
                    minds. That same year, the real <pb n="197" id="VAA4025-087-2-087"/> Bo, who had only served in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Naval Reserves during the war, went Paine one better. On October 29, 1921, before
                    forty-five thousand spectators in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s stadium, Bo scored the only touchdown in Centre College's 6 to 0
                    upset of Harvard College, thus ending a Crimson winning streak that stretched back to 1916.
                    Reminiscing on the game fifty years later, the <placeName>

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Times</hi> judged Centre's victory "football's upset of the
                    century."</p>
            <p>Charles W. Akers's and John W. Carter's <hi rend="i">Bo McMillin</hi> attempts to
                    separate man and legend—a difficult task considering that Bo consciously nursed and then
                    tried to live his own legend. As if their biographical assignment were not difficult enough, Akers
                    and Carter consider several other weighty issues. They maintain that McMillin's life
                    "offers a major illustration of the complex way in which football became an integrated
                    component of American society" (pp. xii-xiii). "Beyond the internal history of
                    football," they assert, "the life of this unique man raises and illuminates some
                    of the perennial questions about the place of sport in American society: the influence of coaches
                    over their players, athletics as a tool of colleges in attracting students and raising endowments,
                    the connection between sport and religion, society's need for heroes, and the symbiotic
                    relationship of the press to the athletic programs of schools" (p. xiii). This is a great
                    deal of ground to cover in a slim volume, but it is to the authors' credit that they at
                    least attempt to link McMillin's life to the larger issues that swirled around him.</p>
            <p>Bo's playing career is covered in the first third of the book and is an interesting story.
                    Here especially Akers and Carter do a fine job of separating fact from fancy. In Bo's
                    history of himself his life was a parable: a poverty-plagued, wild, criminal boyhood redeemed by the
                    saving graces of football. In fact, Bo was not as poor as he often indicated; nor was he as bad. But
                    football was important to him from the time he was an adolescent to the day he died. After a very
                    successful high school career in Fort Worth, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1917 at the age of twenty-two he enrolled at Centre College. A small Presbyterian
                    school, Centre prided itself on its fine academic program and its distinguished alumni. Perhaps Bo
                    was interested in becoming one of the latter, but he was certainly not interested in the benefits of
                    the former. Bo's total lack of interest in academics, however, did not seem to bother
                    either Centre's administration or faculty. President William A. Ganfield consciously used
                    football to raise Centre's enrollment and endowment. For the next five years, then, Centre
                    and Bo used each other to achieve their different but not mutually exclusive ends.</p>
            <p>It was at Centre that the essential Bo became evident; he became a classic hypocrite. As Akers and
                    Carter note, "the rigors of his boyhood had deeply embedded another strain in his
                    character, revealed in his urging others to study while neglecting his own <pb n="198" id="VAA4025-087-2-088"/> classes, in his remaining an inveterate gambler while eschewing other
                    vices…" (p. 50). Bo, who had spent several summers working on the Chautauqua
                    circuit, spoke with great passion about loyalty, duty, and sacrifice. But he did not live those
                    ideas. Rather, he was always in search of the next, best deal. He probably would have left Centre
                    before the famous Harvard game if a professional team would have offered him enough money. And as a
                    coach he jumped from one school to the next—from Centenary College to <placeName>

            <p>Throughout <hi rend="i">Bo McMillin</hi> Akers and Carter show Bo's strengths as well as his
                    weaknesses, his successes as well as his failures. But the authors do not fall under Bo's
                    legendary charm. The end result is a satisfying short biography. Particularly noteworthy is their
                    treatment of Bo's years as a player at Centre College and as a coach at Indiana University.
                    Although the book has no footnotes or bibliography, it appears to be based on interviews, newspapers
                    and magazine articles, and college and university archival records. Finally, <hi rend="i">Bo

            <p>Frederick C. Luebke's latest contribution to the field of German-American and immigration
                    history is a collection of ten essays exploring aspects of immigration historiography and German
                    immigration to America and <placeName>
                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName>. Luebke offers several reasons historians have until recently neglected German
                    immigration, including the vagueness of the label "German," the size and diversity
                    of this population, and the cultural amnesia brought on by two world wars. His essays suggest that
                    not only historians but also German-Americans themselves encountered these problems.</p>
            <p>The essays cover three major themes: polarization and conflict in <placeName>
                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName>, assimilation and conflict in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and immigration historiography. The three Brazilian essays examine the history of
                    Germans in that country and the extreme repression they suffered during World War I, adding
                    comparisons to the situation in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The "Teuto-Brazilians" remained an isolated minority, a domestic
                    wartime target for the host society. In <placeName>
                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName> the nightmare of the war included the total prohibition of any publication,
                    instruction, or public usage of the German language.</p>
            <pb n="199" id="VAA4025-087-2-089"/>
            <p>The five American essays are centered on identity and assimilation. For German immigrants and their
                    children identity meant maintenance of their language and religious institutions. Luebke admits that
                    his "own interest in the history of Germans in America was originally generated by a desire
                    to understand the segment of immigrant society" from which he sprang (p. xiii). The
                    remaining essays in this theme examine the issues and failures of German-American leadership in the
                    political arena. Except for battling the Know Nothing threat of the 1850s, very few political causes
                    or issues, including Sabbatarianism, prohibition, women's suffrage, and restrictive school
                    legislation, united the large and diverse German immigrant group already divided by religion and
                    class. Catholics, Free Thinkers, Lutherans, and Pietists held "differing views about the
                    role of government in questions of morality" (p. 85). Luebke also analyzes the attitudes of
                    German-American voters and the frustration of ethnic leaders in the post-World War I period.</p>
            <p>Two of the essays discuss German-American and immigration historiography. Luebke chronologically
                    examines the development of immigration history from Frederick Jackson Turner through Oscar Handlin
                    to its current stage of "social analysis of ethnopolitical history" (p. xix),
                    which explores the relationships between ethnicity and class. "Three Centuries of Germans
                    in America" provides a brief synopsis of German-American history and traces the evolution
                    of the field, which was once awash in filiopietism and ethnic cultural chauvinism. In the last
                    twenty-five years, however, German-American history has come of age, borrowing methods from
                    sociologists, anthropologists, linguists, cultural geographers, and folklorists. Luebke concludes
                    that German ethnic behaviors and attitudes, unidentified or submerged, remain in
                    "middle-class America—especially in the states of the Midwest" (p.
                    180).</p>
            <p>The Midwest figures prominently in all but three of the essays. Conspicuously absent from the
                    excellent bibliography is Frances H. Ellis's work on German language instruction in the
                    public schools of <placeName>

                    studies; this volume is a valuable contribution to the field and to midwestern and immigration
                    history. He poses a number of questions that need to be addressed and can be answered using Indiana
                    subjects and sources. Indiana Germans are ripe for study and investigation.</p>

               </figure> country stores and suburban malls, suffragists and civil rights
                    protesters—should skip this book. It is strictly for graduate students and professors of
                    history trying to keep abreast of the historiography of the Midwest. The book—really a
                    long essay—has a lofty title and a rather narrower focus. There is little analysis of the
                    multiple dimensions of regionalism as an analytic tool. The focus is narrowly on the economic basis
                    and ideological foundations of politics from 1800 to 1900, with considerable stress on the
                    territorial period. The approach is not behavioral (no voting statistics here, or statistics of any
                    sort), but rather postmodern cultural critique. Much is made of migration, industrialization,
                    communities, markets, labor unions, abolitionists, commercial elites, the idea of progress,
                    pluralism, and the tension between working-class and bourgeois culture. Every chapter excoriates
                    Frederick Jackson Turner and his notion that the Midwest was the seedbed for political democracy;
                    that myth was a rationalization created by a group that briefly controlled the region, the
                    entrepreneurs and bourgeois (very few of whom were French, despite the terminology).</p>
            <p>The authors lack an adequate theoretical framework to critique effectively the historians they
                    discuss. While they move beyond the old Progressive idea that economic interests cause political
                    behavior, they seem to believe that economic structure causes political behavior. They do not
                    discuss the weaknesses of that theory or show why it is more useful than the alternative notions
                    that cultural groups cause political behavior, or that shared political ideas supersede both
                    economic and cultural structures. Their exact beliefs are not always clear. They cite studies that
                    use the modernization paradigm but carefully avoid the term (modernization is currently not
                    "politically correct"). They refer to ethno-cultural groups but do not directly
                    challenge the ethnocultural model of political behavior. It is disconcerting indeed to encounter a
                    book of historiography that deliberately neglects every historian before 1970 (except for Turner),
                    thus leaving a false impression of <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-087-2-091"/> what is worth reading and
                    worth knowing. On the other hand, if the goal is to concentrate on recent ideas, it is a disservice
                    to the graduate student audience not to alert it to the highly influential behavioral theories of
                    political history that include the "<placeName>

                    realignment/critical election theory. The authors' attempt to engage the historians of the
                    1970s and 1980s will trouble readers who have the old-fashioned view that history books ought to be
                    about the past.</p>

                    Herring begins <hi rend="i">The Enduring Indians</hi> by tracing how the eastern Indians came to <placeName>

                    </placeName>. He notes that the first groups arrived soon after the War of 1812 and introduced
                    various elements of white culture, most notably disease and whiskey, to local tribes. The author
                    then deftly summarizes the Jacksonian removals that brought many more eastern Indians to <placeName>

                    </placeName> and the white expansion in the 1850s that resulted in a second removal of most groups
                    to Indian Territory.</p>

            <p>The main body of Herring's book deals with the fate of the Kickapoos, Potawatomis,
                    Chippe-was, Munsees, Iowas, Sacs, and others who remained in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> after the second removal. Although the various tribes responded differently to white
                    settlement, Herring argues that most "acculturated on their own terms" (p. 2). He
                    points out, for example, that removed Indians had already adapted many elements of Plains culture,
                    including buffalo hunting, tepees, and ceremonies. As white settlement developed, the Indians
                    shifted to taking local game, small-scale farming, sales of products, and day labor.
                    Herring's discussion indicates that white settlers were probably less a threat than
                    missionaries, federal officials, and corrupt Indian leaders. The strategy of adaptation brought
                    mixed results. After a long struggle, troops moved Mokohoko's band of Sacs to Indian
                    Territory. The Prairie Potawatomis avoided removal but submitted to land allotment. Whether
                    successful or unsuccessful, however, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> Indians avoided the catastrophe of armed resistance. In the final chapter, Herring
                    discusses continuing adaptations during the twentieth century. Although economic necessity after
                    1929 forced many to leave their communities for urban jobs, Herring emphasizes that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> Indians still retain several cultural and religious practices.</p>
            <p>Herring's book deserves high marks on several counts. He organizes his material well, writes
                    clearly, and provides strong insights. His footnotes indicate a mastery of secondary sources and
                    sizable research in archival materials. Most impressive, Herring goes beyond the official aspects of
                    Indian-white relations and provides a good understanding of Indians' perceptions and
                    behavior as they responded to changes.</p>

            <p>Thomas D. Isern has done it again. Just as his <hi rend="i">Custom Combining on the Great Plains</hi>
                    (1981) filled a significant gap in regional agricultural history, so this volume dealing with
                    harvesting "before the combine" fills another part of the engaging story of
                    technology, capital, labor, culture, and lore of the plains of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. Like the earlier study, this one is an admirable combination of thorough research,
                    finely crafted narrative, and instructive illustrations. It meets the standards of professional
                    historians and appeals to the larger public's abiding fascination with threshing machines.</p>
            <p>The history of harvesting technology and detailed explanations of how equipment was used, including
                    power and labor, provide the background for harvesting and threshing practices on the plains. Prior
                    to the development of the combine, which <hi rend="i">combined</hi> both tasks, harvesting referred
                    to the cutting of the crop and storing in shocks or stacks, and threshing was the separation of the
                    grain from the straw and chaff. Some readers, especially collectors and those who follow the
                    antique-threshing-show circuit, will wish for more specific details on name-brand equipment (which
                    is available in other places but could have been incorporated here). The later chapter on combines
                    provides more of this type of information for those machines than is included regarding earlier
                    binders, headers, separators, and engines.</p>
            <p>Isern is at his best when describing the workings of threshing crews and the variety of practices
                    related by participants. The division of labor and duties of everyone (including engineers,
                    separator men, water monkeys, firemen, drivers, bindlestiffs, grain <pb n="204" id="VAA4025-087-2-094"/> haulers, and cooks) are enhanced with stories and illustrations. The
                    details about the huge migratory labor force involved in harvesting and threshing on the plains
                    include workers, ethnic groups, recruiting, travel, wages, food, lodging, and labor organizations.</p>
            <p>Isern is a keen student of the Great Plains, and he provides regional interpretation that reaches
                    different conclusions than J. Sanford Rikoon's <hi rend="i">Threshing in the Midwest</hi>
                    (1988). Plains farmers and threshermen adapted readily to changing technology, at least in part
                    because of the chronic shortage of local laborers. The plains environment produced subregional
                    variations, such as winter wheat on the southern and central plains and spring wheat on the northern
                    plains, which affected equipment choices and harvesting practices, such as binders or headers. The
                    adoption of the combine on the Great Plains produced a revolution in wheat farming. <hi rend="i">Bull Threshers and Bindlestiffs</hi> stands alone as a scholarly study; it also provides
                    relevant background for the "sequel" that was published first, <hi rend="i">Custom

            <p>This book, although impressive in many ways, delivers less than its title promises. It is a study of
                    the ecclesiastical politics of the American Home Missionary Society, one of the central elements of
                    the evangelical "Benevolent Empire" in the antebellum <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, from the Old School-New School split among Presbyterians to the onset of the Civil
                    War. <hi rend="i">Conscience and Slavery</hi> is admirable in its extensive research and attention
                    to personalities and detail. But when Victor B. Howard attempts to explicate the significance of
                    these events in the context of the times, his central argument is less impressive.</p>
            <p>The outline of Howard's story is familiar to scholars of antislavery and American religion.
                    The American Home Missionary Society was one of the groups, composed largely of <placeName>

                    </placeName> Congregationalists and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> Presbyterians and adherents farther west, that attempted to save the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> from the rising tide of barbarism it perceived outside <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> after the War of 1812. Central to its mission was a post-millennial vision of reform in
                    which the Kingdom of God would dawn in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. To that end, Christians had to take the <pb n="205" id="VAA4025-087-2-095"/> lead in
                    banishing sin from the land. From the 1830s onward, two groups struggled for control of the society,
                    one convinced that slavery was the worst of sins and thus had to be attacked as a sin while the
                    society broke all ties with slaveholders save as sinners to be converted, the other convinced that
                    antislavery had to be subordinated to missionary work in the South—missionary work in
                    which Christian slaveholders would play an important role. Howard shows how the abolitionist view
                    gradually came to prevail, reflecting, he argues, the conversion of the northern public to views of
                    a dangerous "Slave Power Conspiracy" that climaxed with the Republican victory in
                    the election of 1860 and the consequent secession of slave states.</p>
            <p>The strength of Howard's work lies in its massive research base, involving work in the
                    records of dozens of Presbyterian synods and presbyteries and Congregational associations, not to
                    mention an extensive reading of the church and secular press. He provides an impressive account of
                    the people and events that gradually moved certain evangelicals, including Presbyterians in Indiana,
                    toward an antislavery position. What many readers will find unconvincing is his interpretation of
                    the significance of these events, his insistence for example that "The action of
                    abolitionists in criticizing the northern church was less effective in purifying the moral outlook
                    of the northern church than it was in strengthening the proslavery stance of the southern
                    church" (p. 189). At best, Howard's argument that true Christians could have
                    resolved the problem of slavery through compromise is unconvincing after a generation of scholarship
                    on abolition and slavery to the contrary. Still, however, historians of abolition and American
                    religion can learn much from this book.</p>

                    $29.95.)</head>
            <p>Scholars have generally ignored Mary Elizabeth Massey's call of nearly thirty years ago for
                    studies of the Civil War home front. Now George C. Rable's finely crafted volume casts new
                    light on the ways in which warfare transformed the lives of southern white women who both supported
                    and ultimately undermined southern nationalism and the war effort.</p>
            <p>Comprehensively quoting southern white women of all classes, Rable intensely dramatizes the heroism
                    and heartache they faced during the Civil War. He recreates this intensity with such persuasive <pb n="206" id="VAA4025-087-2-096"/> clarity and urgency that the reader almost hopes to encounter a
                    happier ending, even though despair prevails. Rable relies on traditional literary sources and
                    admits an elite bias in his examination of southern economic and social structure. The neglect of
                    African-American women from this analysis is unfortunate. Nevertheless, the amount of research is
                    voluminous; the analysis insightful. Even the notes are marvelous syntheses of the literature.</p>
            <p>From his first quote, about the safety and shelter of a woman's life, to his last, about the
                    hardship of factory life, Rable follows changes wrought on the home front. He investigates
                    women's reaction to their society's definitions of woman's place and the
                    extent to which the Civil War affected their social identity, their view of themselves, their world.
                    His interpretation of various of the war's paradoxes are discerning and astute. He
                    discusses, for instance, the dual role of religion as simultaneously encouraging female
                    submissiveness and public activity.</p>
            <p>Rable's description of class tensions among whites is a theme throughout the book.
                    Increasing social friction resulted when the wealthy used the legal and political process to their
                    own advantage. Yeomen were galled by the disparity of sacrifice. Rable concludes that families from
                    all economic classes were impoverished by the war, but that some of the wealthy continued to live
                    well and did not bear their fair share of the war effort. He also contends that historians have
                    erred in overemphasizing white women's antislavery sentiments, that their race and class
                    prevented any understanding of the slave's plight. He concludes that racism intensified as
                    slavery disintegrated. In a departure from white sources, Rable uses testimony from former slaves to
                    discuss white women's treatment of their slaves.</p>
            <p>Rable argues that plantation (and to a lesser extent, farming) women generally accepted their
                    assigned places in the economic, social, and familial order. He analyzes the few economic
                    opportunities for women and is a little too patronizing in his analysis that women preferred
                    security rather than "a harshly competitive economic and social order." One of the
                    opportunities open to women was nursing. Rable praises women's hospital work; in hospitals
                    run by women, the mortality rate (5 percent) was half that of hospitals run by men (10 percent
                    mortality).</p>
            <p>Rable finds that by mid-1862 survival outranked patriotism as a motivating factor. Letters to the
                    Confederate government discussed hunger, high prices, and shortages, and with the desperation of the
                    starving, women encouraged their menfolk to desert. Rable's portrayal of this quiet, angry
                    desperation is very moving.</p>
            <p>Rable summarizes that new demands on women were met differently by the many individuals affected, but
                    "most lived from day to day, much as their mothers and grandmothers had done, praying for
                    their families, perhaps hoping for better days, but seldom <pb n="207" id="VAA4025-087-2-097"/>
                    expecting miracles." He concludes that the dichotomy of continuity or change is too
                    simplistic, the Civil War wrought "Change without change" (p. 288).
                    Rable's book is an excellent overview of crucial issues: survival, the Confederate home
                    front, white women, patriarchy and paternalism, class tensions, patriotism, desertion, and more. It
                    is a must for anyone interested in Civil War history or the American South.</p>

            <p>The relationship between religion and politics during the Civil War era has only recently attracted
                    the attention of historians. Those who examine the southern experience have taken the topic with
                    great seriousness, as the works of James W. Silver, Samuel S. Hill, W. Harrison Daniel, and the
                    authors of <hi rend="i">Why the South Lost the Civil War</hi> demonstrate. Except for major
                    contributions by James Moorhead and John R. McKivigan, however, religion's role in northern
                    decision making has not been adequately treated. Fortunately, Victor B. Howard's study of
                    religious influences on Radical Republicanism helps fill that void.</p>
            <p>Howard's purpose is to analyze "the interplay of religion and politics"
                    (p. ix) during the war and its aftermath. He focuses on the church's involvement in
                    slavery, emancipation, and black suffrage, and especially on the manner in which the pulpit and the
                    sectarian press called on people "to carry their religion into politics" (p. 59).
                    Using an exceptional arsenal of primary sources, Howard points to the centrality of religion in the
                    shaping of Radical Republicanism. Indeed, northern Protestant churches, particularly those of
                    evangelical persuasion, were "the conscience of the Republican party" (p. 1); many
                    of that party's Radicals were prominent figures in the major denominations and joined their
                    clergy in espousing "pulpit politics" (p. 66). These Christians saw emancipation
                    as the essential step toward cleansing the nation of its most flagrant sin. Thus, with abolition and
                    black justice as their primary cause, they viewed the Civil War as a Christian <hi rend="i">jihad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In explaining precisely how radical Christians influenced northern decision making, Howard
                    investigates the church's role in the era's major issues. Particularly noteworthy
                    is his treatment of Christians' reactions to Abraham Lincoln's handling of the
                    emancipation question, including their chagrin over the president's repudiation of Generals
                    John C. Frémont and David Hunter for their premature proclamations in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> and the Department of <pb n="208" id="VAA4025-087-2-098"/> the South. Likewise,
                    Howard's analyses of the church's role in the adoption of constitutional
                    amendments and of the Johnson impeachment proceedings are insightful.</p>
            <p>The author has mined the field well, uncovering an impressive array of sources. It is unfortunate,
                    then, that the book contains some questionable and often inadequately supported conclusions.
                    Frequently, Howard assumes that a politician's connection with a specific religious
                    tradition is satisfactory evidence for designating him a "radical Christian." For
                    instance, Benjamin Wade fits the category because he "traveled in religious
                    circles" (p. 17), while General Hunter belongs since he was a Presbyterian whose father was
                    an army chaplain (p. 28). These, and many other examples, cause the reader to wonder whether mere
                    affiliation is ample proof that a politician's voting record or rhetoric directly flowed
                    from religion. Furthermore, numerous conclusions lack solid support, such as Howard's
                    statements that "radical Christian sentiment… was overwhelming in its
                    intensity" in prompting Lincoln to sign the Emancipation Proclamation (p. 50) and that
                    conservatives seceded from northwestern churches <hi rend="i">because</hi> of "the
                    fierceness and passion" of radical evangelical views (pp. 66–67). Finally, the
                    book suffers from a rather tedious and encyclopedic style, with quotes from clergy, conventions, and
                    journals being strung together in a seemingly endless pattern.</p>
            <p>Yet, Howard has done yeoman's work in this book, unearthing material upon which further
                    studies can be undertaken; this alone makes it a priceless contribution to one's knowledge
                    of religion's political role during the nation's greatest crisis.</p>

               </placeName>: Stanford University Press, 1990. Pp. xiii, 580. Maps, Illustrations,
                    notes, tables, index. $60,00.)</head>
            <p>A major contribution to railroad history, George W. Hilton's work incisively examines and
                    analyzes an important phase that most rail historians have overlooked. Because standard gauge of 4
                    feet 8½ inches is now universal, it will amaze many to learn that narrow gauge, mostly 3
                    feet, was significant in the nation's rail development. These lines spread through
                    forty-four states and totaled 18,529 miles and accounted for as much as 35 percent of new mileage in
                    the peak year. Ultimately most were converted or abandoned.</p>
            <p>Hilton's book, which is divided into two sections, first digs deeply into narrow gauge
                    origins in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and supports the legend <pb n="209" id="VAA4025-087-2-099"/> that standard gauge by
                    happenstance duplicated the distance between Roman chariot wheels. An economist, Hilton discusses in
                    depth the slim gauge movement and the lengthy, complex cost controversy that surrounded it.
                    Proponents claimed construction savings and lower operating and financing costs. Opponents,
                    meanwhile, countered that savings were minimal—that more trains were required because of
                    smaller capacity cars, which translated into higher train crew expense. They also maintained that
                    costs of transshipment to the proliferating standard gauge network minimized any savings. Hilton
                    examines the narrow gauge fever that resulted in two national conventions and traces the
                    movement's lingering death following collapse of the Grand Narrow Gauge Trunk in 1883 after
                    it had nearly completed a line from <placeName>

                    incompatability problem, and industry decline. Each reflects exhaustive research, well-organized
                    writing, and knowledgable interpretation. The second half of the book, an incomparable resource,
                    lists a biography of every known company, arranged by states.</p>
            <p>Indiana had strong ties to the narrow gauge industry. Hilton credits Colonel Edward Hulbert, who
                    managed a southern Indiana road and retired to a <placeName>

                    recognize <pb n="210" id="VAA4025-087-2-100"/> the inextricable entanglement of religion and culture
                    and to search for what seems to be an almost Tillichian "dimension of depth" in
                    all cultural expressions.</p>
            <p>As is usually the case in such collections, the authors gamely fit the results of their research on
                    particular people, movements, or issues to the overall theme, but the essays will be of interest
                    chiefly to students of those people, movements, or issues. For this reason, a review can best serve
                    potential readers by describing the individual pieces, which are organized in reverse chronological
                    order.</p>
            <p>To begin, Edward Linenthal demonstrates how, in responding to the possibilities of nuclear war and
                    nuclear disarmament, both the Committee on Present Danger on the right and the Physicians for Social
                    Responsibility on the left felt compelled to go beyond secular arguments by constructing a
                    mythological appeal to American exceptionalism. Albert Raboteau then describes Martin Luther King,
                    Jr.'s progression from a position that insisted on American exceptionalism to a stance that
                    called for "allegiances and loyalties … which go beyond our nation's
                    self-defined goals …" (p. 60). Charles Reagan Wilson argues that the distinctive
                    civil religion of the South can contribute to the transformation of American civil religion recently
                    called for by Robert Bellah. Ronald Delattre offers an insightful account of "supply-side
                    spirituality" and its relation to the culture of abundance that gave it birth. L. Shannon
                    Jung contends that the traditional Judeo-Christian "stewardship ethic" could not
                    resist the forces that led American agriculture to become American agribusiness. Joel
                    Carpenter's account of the rise of Youth for Christ in the late 1940s demonstrates how
                    evangelicals had to compromise their distinctive theological positions in order to gain acceptance
                    in American public life. Jonathan Sarna perceptively describes the frustrations encountered by both
                    "accommodationist" and "rejectionist" Jews in distinguishing the
                    Christmas of American civil religion from the Christmas of Christians. Taking his cue from Alexis de
                    Tocqueville and Bellah, John Roth explores the concept of individualism in George Santayana,
                    Reinhold Niebuhr, and John Dewey. Richard Hughes traces the fortunes of
                    restorationism—the effort "to recover the primordial past that stood behind the
                    historical past" (p. 194)—in nineteenth-century America. Amanda Porterfield
                    argues that the story of the Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenkswatawa teaches people to distinguish
                    between a constructive reliance on mythic vision to shape political reality and a destructive
                    reliance on supernatural power to solve political problems. Finally, James Moseley invites scholars
                    to see in John Winthrop's <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> the prototypical development of
                    "a new, more characteristically American religiousness" (p. 239).</p>
