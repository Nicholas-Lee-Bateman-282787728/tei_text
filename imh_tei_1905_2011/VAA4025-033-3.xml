            <p>James Bryce wisely observed that state constitutions furnish invaluable material and are a mine of
                    instruction for the history of democratic communities.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> If this be true, the
                    first constitution of a state should reveal some of the social and political ideals of its citizens
                    at the time of its adoption. A study of such a document, which includes the antecedents of the
                    members of the convention, the contests in framing the constitution, and the ideas of which it was
                    formed, aids one in understanding the part played by the settlers from the various sections of the
                    nation in the founding of the new commonwealth.</p>
            <p>The movement for statehood in Indiana was a natural outgrowth of the contests of the earlier period.
                    During his governorship of the territory, William Henry Harrison became identified with the

                    </placeName>, with the group of officials that he appointed to the various county and territorial
                    offices, and with the settlers who believed that the prohibition of slavery north of the
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> was excluding desirable immigrants, delaying the development of

            </p>
            <p>The War of 1812 gave Harrison an honorable escape from the growing opposition. The extent to which
                    the old division disappeared with him is disputed. Jacob P. Dunn thought that the old issues
                    continued until the constitution was framed. Governor Thomas Posey, who succeeded Harrison, was also
                    a Virginian and a soldier.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> He had petitioned for the admission of slaves.
                    "It was only natural," wrote Dunn, "that the personal friends of General
                    Harrison became Posey's personal friends; and in equally natural sequence he fell heir to

            <p>Undoubtedly Professor Esarey has made a much needed correction in calling attention to the
                    overemphasis on the slavery question, but it is possible that he has gone too far in the opposite
                    direction. Animosities and prejudices die slowly, voters are not especially rational, and
                    politicians hesitate to surrender a useful issue. Jennings was a skilful politician,<hi rend="sup">20</hi> slavery was discussed,<hi rend="sup">21</hi> and something like the old division is to
                    be seen in a careful analysis of the work of the convention.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Something of the
                    aristocratic social order might be maintained with indentured servitude, and convictions must be
                    honored even in defeat.</p>
            <p>Only statehood could give the popular party control over patronage and the executive. A state
                    constitution, with a rigid prohibition of negro indenture as well as slavery, would guard the people
                    against the possible future introduction of negroes, and check permanently the development of an
                    aristocratic society that was patterned on that of the plantation South. Of great importance, also,
                    was the desire for complete local self-government and participation in national affairs. The old
                    Harrison group was opposed to this development, for it would end the regime that gave them honors
                    and positions.</p>
            <p>After the territorial assembly petitioned for statehood and an adequate population was indicated by a
                    census, Congress passed an enabling act authorizing a constitutional convention.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> The passage of the act came so shortly before the date set for the election of delegates,

                    natives of the North, while four were of foreign birth. Altogether thirteen of the sixteen had lived
                    in the South.</p>
            <p>A comparison of the two groups is interesting. The popular party contained two New Englanders who
                    were members of the convention. These and the seven natives of the Middle States made a total of
                    nine or thirty-five per cent of the popular party born in the North. In contrast only three of the
                    opposition were born in the North and they constituted but nineteen per cent of their group. More
                    than half of both groups were southern by nativity, fifty-eight per cent of the popular party and
                    fifty-six of the opposition. Only one of the delegates is known to have come from the Lowland South,
                    although the opposition seems to have desired to establish in Indiana a type of life somewhat
                    approximating that of the plantation area. In the popular party were certain individuals who were
                    much opposed to this. They included two Quakers, two Baptist preachers, one Methodist preacher, one
                    delegate said to have been friendly to the Quakers, and the two New Englanders. In the opposition,
                    however, were four men who owned negroes either as slaves or servants. The distribution of the
                    appointments made by Harrison serves to connect the convention with the differences of the
                    territorial period. One-third of the popular party, including those who had left the circle of
                    Harrison's friends, had received appointments, while three-fourths of the opposition party
                    of the convention had been favored under Harrison.</p>
            <p>Not only was the popular group and the opposition more than half composed of natives of the South,
                    but the total number of native southerners was twenty-five of the forty-three members of the
                    convention, or fifty-eight per cent. Adding to this number the members who had resided in the South
                    but had not been born there, the total of those who had come in contact with life in that section
                    before coming to Indiana was thirty-two or seventy-four per cent of the convention.</p>
            <p>The convention began its work by choosing as its president Jonathan Jennings and by authorizing him
                    to appoint a number of committees.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> He did not act in a partisan manner, for he
                    chose from the opposition as many committee chairmen as from his own group. The marked ability of

                    the majority group, but this was to be expected for the majority was almost twice as numerous as the
                    opposition.</p>
            <p>The votes of the members of the convention do not reveal a strict partisan alignment, but they do
                    indicate that there were two groups whose views were not alike.<hi rend="sup">59</hi> The absence of
                    a strict alignment is proved by two facts: the members voted independently and sometimes
                    inconsistently, even on important matters; and more than half of the recorded roll calls were not
                    party votes, but were generally concerned with minor affairs about which there was general agreement
                    or a lack of party understanding.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, certain votes reveal differences between the two parties. The first difference
                    concerned the size of a quorum, the Jennings group favoring a majority of those elected, while the
                    opposition preferred two-thirds.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> The latter would have given the opposition a
                    powerful parliamentary weapon. Even in the face of the victory of the statehood movement, six of the
                    opposition voted against establishing a state government.<hi rend="sup">61</hi> The group in control
                    inserted a prohibition of slavery and involuntary servitude which declared that the constitution
                    could never be changed to introduce either into the state. The opposition did not oppose the
                    antislavery clause, but did oppose the accompanying declaration, and, when defeated in an effort to
                    eliminate it, proposed striking out a statement that a future convention could revise the
                    constitution. When this, too, was defeated, Johnson, one of the leading members of the minority,
                    proposed to strike out the prohibition of involuntary servitude, but this was negatived without a
                    record roll call.<hi rend="sup">62</hi> It is unfortunate that it cannot be learned how the members
                    voted on this matter, for it was the only vote that was directly concerned with slavery. In the
                    absence of such information, it is only possible to point out that the opposition did not take a
                    stand in favor of slavery although some of its members had favored it in the past. It seems that
                    they wished to preserve as much freedom of action in regard to the future as possible. Several votes

                    </placeName>, where the difficulties between the legislature and the governor in the territorial
                    period caused the convention to establish an executive with little power. The executive department

                    appointment, of remitting fines and forfeitures, and of vetoing bills. A popularly elected
                    lieutenant governor was to succeed the governor in case of the death of the latter or his removal
                    from office. The judiciary article (article five) was more original than any of the preceeding
                    articles, but it established substantially the same system as existed in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, appointed the members of the supreme court. The election of lesser judges and clerks
                    was more democratic than the methods in use in <placeName>

                    probably very slight, but it was in the direction of greater democracy. The remainder of the article
                    was somewhat like article four of the constitution of <placeName>

                    rule. The article on amendments (article eight) prohibited any change which would permit slavery, as
                    did the constitution of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Article eleven contained a prohibition of slavery and of any further contracts for
                    indentured servitude, the latter being milder than a similar provision of the constitution of <placeName>

            <p>Probably the most important parts of the constitution of Indiana were those for which there was

                    educational progress was made by this convention which was controlled by members of southern origin.
                    The article devoted to education (article nine) noted the importance of knowledge and learning to
                    free government, provided for the use of lands granted for educational purposes, and required the
                    general assembly to establish a "system of education, ascending in a regular gradation,
                    from township schools to a state university, wherein tuition shall be gratis, and equally open to
                    all." Money paid for exemption from military service should be used to establish county
                    seminaries, a penal code should be founded upon principles of reformation, one or more farms should
                    be provided as an asylum for the aged and unfortunate, and ten per cent of the proceeds of lot sales
                    in each new county seat should be used to establish libraries. A small part of the phraseology came
                    from the constitution of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, but if family tradition may be trusted, the principal person involved in framing this
                    article was a descendant of a <placeName>

                    </placeName>. A dislike of banks, foreshadowing the Jacksonian movement was revealed in the tenth
                    article, which prohibited private banks with note issuing powers.</p>
            <p>It may be noted, by way of conclusion and summary, that the Indiana constitution was an outgrowth of
                    the territorial period, because the desire for greater self-government was a natural consequence of
                    larger numbers and added wealth, and because statehood was necessary to give the popular party a
                    complete victory over the older <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> aristocrats. The election, following a very brief campaign, was a victory for the
                    popular party, which was representative of the immigrants from the Upland South, including the
                    Quakers, and others from the Middle States and <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName>. It opposed the desire of the older Harrison party to establish in Indiana social and
                    political conditions based upon the plantation South. The opposition party was composed of men from
                    the Upland South and the Middle States, but men who seem to have acquired a belief in ideals that
                    resembled in some measure those of the more aristocratic South. The contest was therefore largely
                    between two groups of southerners, one holding to the democratic ideas of the Upland South, the
                    other to parts of the philosophy of the Lowland South. The constitution, which the convention
                    adopted, was modeled very largely upon <pb n="276" id="VAA4025-033-3-018"/> the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> constitutions. To a lesser extent, it resembled the constitutions of <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, because of direct borrowing and because the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> constitution was much like that of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, and the constitutions of <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. The antislavery provisions distinguish it from those adopted south of the
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>, while its democratic features represent the more complete
                    operation of the frontier influence. Its similarity to the above mentioned constitutions, and its
                    antislavery and democratic features indicate that it embodied the ideas of an expanding Upland
                    South. The advanced educational stand taken by the convention proves that the southern influence was
                    not entirely hostile to educational progress.</p>

            </byline>
            <p>Abraham Lincoln spent approximately one-fourth of his life in Indiana. He entered the southern part
                    of the State in 1816 as a boy of seven. He departed in 1830 as a young man of twenty-one. During
                    those formative years of his life, the frontier state underwent such rapid settlement that the
                    population increased more than four-fold. Thousands of these hardy pioneers were to live to cast
                    their votes for or against Lincoln as a candidate for the presidency, and tens of thousands of their
                    sons were to respond to his calls for troops to defend the Union. Few of them, however, were to know
                    anything of the ex-Hoosier until he attained political prominence during the later fifties as a
                    leader of the Republicans in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In the Old Northwest, Lincoln represented the moderate wing of the new Republican Party, composed of
                    former Whigs and Democrats of mild antislavery views and with a distinctly western attitude on the
                    economic issues of the day. Since the great majority of Indiana Republicans were relatively
                    conservative, they adhered substantially to the same political principles as the former Hoosier.
                    Consequently they accepted him unanimously and enthusiastically as their candidate for the
                    presidency in 1860, and during the campaign they were joined by a sufficient number of old-line
                    Whigs, former "Know-Nothings" and additional Democrats to carry the State and
                    contribute materially to his election.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was natural, therefore, for these men to take an unusual interest in the course pursued by the new
                    President in the national crisis that confronted him. On the whole they were inclined to be
                    sympathetic and to support the general program of his Administration. But they observed events from
                    a more provincial viewpoint than he and often opposed certain details and censured many of the
                    specific persons and methods that he employed. Since Lincoln was unusually observant of and
                    responsive to public opinion, it was to play a major role in the tragedy of 186–865.</p>

            <p>The best available barometer of political opinon in Indiana during the Civil War was probably the
                    local newspaper. It was ordinarily located at the county seat, a country town of only a few hundred
                    or at most a few thousand inhabitants. There the editor associated closely with the people. He was
                    usually an influential member of the county and sometimes of the state political organization.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> His paper was the only regular source of political information for many
                    members of his party, and he frequently mixed news items with editorials to such an extent that it
                    was not always easy to distinguish facts from opinions. Consequently he helped to mold as well as to
                    express popular sentiment on public questions. Although the local editor was considerably influenced
                    by the leading metropolitan journals,<hi rend="sup">3</hi> upon which he was obliged to depend for
                    much of his information on national affairs, yet he often expressed the independent and even the
                    contrary view of his community.</p>
            <p>The first action of Abraham Lincoln as President-elect that particularly concerned the Indiana
                    Republicans was the formation of his Cabinet. Prior to 1861, no Hoosier had ever served in a
                    president's Cabinet, but three were to be appointed at various times by Lincoln. The
                    important role played by Indiana in his nomination and election was largely responsible for his
                    appointment of Caleb B. Smith, a prominent <placeName>

                    considerable favor in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Still, opposition developed among some of the
                    Republicans. George W. Julian, former Freesoiler and now a Representative-elect, disliked such a
                    conservative for the cabinet and visited Lincoln at <placeName>

            <p>Lincoln's inaugural address was conciliatory in tone but firm in its denial of the right of
                    secession and in its insistence that the Union must be maintained at all hazards. For a working
                    basis, the new President declared that his policy would be to enforce the laws and "to
                    hold, occupy and possess" the property of the Government. The response of his party
                    followers in Indiana was uniformly and enthusiastically favorable. Almost without exception they
                    commended his temperate but unequivocal language and his distinctly national outlook.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> One editor liked his "spirit of boldness, sincerity and unmistakable honesty

                    secessionists. To most of the Republicans such a step was unexpected and seemed like an immediate
                    desertion of the President's announced purpose to hold the property of the Government. Many
                    were deeply disappointed that their first President should at once pursue essentially the same

            <p>As soon as Oliver P. Morton became Governor in January, 1861, he assumed an aggressive and
                    unquestioned leadership of the Indiana Republicans, a position he was to maintain throughout the war
                    and beyond. A man of great energy and earnestness, Morton promptly convened the Legislature,
                    proceeded to the task of arming and equipping recruits, urged the War Department to accept
                    additional regiments with fewer restrictions and to furnish arms so that Indiana could defend her
                    southern border from threatened invasion. Aroused by popular impatience, he soon became intolerant
                    of the apparent cautiousness and procrastination of the Lincoln Administration.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> On May 2 Morton met with the Governors of several other States at <placeName>

                    of the war, especially the neglect of the West. The Governors drew up a memorial to the President,
                    recommending the pursuance of a vigorous and offensive war policy and the creation of a Department

            <p>During September the President's treatment of the West again aroused many of his aggressive
                    supporters. They felt that the neglect and inattention of the military authorities were permitting

                    to send arms for the militiamen so that they could protect the State from invasion. When he failed
                    to obtain satisfaction from subordinates, Morton wrote "freely and confidentially"
                    to the President, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation and concluding: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Fundamentally, however, the cause of all this discontent among the Indiana Republicans during the
                    winter of 186–862 was the apparent lack of progress in suppressing the rebellion. The
                    people felt that they were furnishing all the men and money asked for by the Administration, and yet
                    nothing tangible was being accomplished. Soldiers had been recruited by the hundreds of thousands,
                    but the armies were still on the defensive and doing very little actual fighting. As the nice autumn
                    months rolled by and bleak winter days approached, many of Lincoln's political supporters
                    became exceedingly impatient for military victories. They were particularly disappointed because the
                    Army of the Potomac, which had been under the command of General McClellan since July 27, remained
                    inactive near <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Many felt that the ultimate responsibility rested with the President, inasmuch as he,
                    as Commander-in-Chief, could order an advance or change commanding generals. Julian was a member of
                    the new Congressional Committee on the Conduct of the War that was continually pressing Lincoln and
                    McClellan for military action during this period.<hi rend="sup">75</hi> In frequent editorials, the

                    find fault with the action of the Administration" but regretted that the war policy of the
                    Government seemed "to lack that vigor and efficiency so necessary in dealing with this

                    much later that they can't possibly succeed." Disheartened by the
                    "aggregation of bad news, wretched management, and disgraceful indifference," the
                    editor insisted that "the whole of the gloomy appearance is due to one thing only, <hi rend="i">the rebels are doing something</hi>, and we are not."<hi rend="sup">78</hi>

            <p>Amidst such popular discontent it was easy for Indiana Republicans to find fault with their Chief
                    Executive. Some of them censured him severly for permitting Mrs. Lincoln to give a large
                    "Dancing Party" at the White House when the nation was in such dire need of money
                    to finance the war. The leading journal bluntly declared that <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>such displays as that at the White House are a disgrace to the President, which we trust may

                            of money when money is so much needed… and it is about time the President has
                            learned that he has no business to give to such idle, and even pernicious
                            displays…. If his own good sense cannot teach him this he should be taught it by
                            a stern expression of public censure. It is no time for fooling in such a season of mourning

            <p>During the late winter and early spring of 1862 the Union armies finally began to move southward, and
                    for several months they were victorious in practically every important engagement, especially those
                    in the West. With the energetic Stanton becoming Secretary of War in January, 1862, in place of the
                    incompetent Cameron, the confidence of the Northern people in their military superiority rose
                    rapidly. Almost unanimously they came to believe that their armies would conquer the Confederates,
                    capture their capital and crush out the rebellion before the end of the year. Under these
                    circumstancs, the previous dissatisfaction of the Indiana Republicans with their President and his
                    policies tended to disappear.<hi rend="sup">82</hi> In the meantime Lincoln's repeated
                    advocacy of voluntary and compensated emancipation, and his declaration in May that a proclamation
                    of emancipation might become necessary, quieted the opposition of the radical anti-slavery men
                    without seriously weakening his conservative support.<hi rend="sup">83</hi> In many cases this
                    approval was more tacit than expressed, but often the press liberally commended the course of the
                        President.<hi rend="sup">84</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This popular confidence and enthusiasm continued through May and June' while McClellan was

                    unwelcome news reached Indiana that the Army of the Potomac had been defeated before the Confederate
                    Capital and that thousands of additional troops would be needed to bring the war to a successful
                    conclusion. Discouragement and gloom began to settle upon the people. Almost immediately the
                    attitude of the Republicans toward the Administration changed again. Confident that the Union
                    superiority of men and resources was easily adequate for the suppression of the rebellion, they
                    became convinced that failure must be due to the Administration's military policy and to
                    the personnel of the Army leaders.</p>

                    stand. Berry Sulgrove, who had said little about the slavery question, fully approved: "The
                    President's reply is admirable in temper, and takes the only ground he can take in regard

                    insisted that "the monstrous mismanagement of the present war almost from the beginning,
                    and particularly in the light of late developments, is perfectly
                    astounding—appalling." It results "simply from the vain, the insane

            <p>All this denunciation of the man who was soon to become "The Great Emancipator"!
                    For on September 22, 1862, President Lincoln, partially in response to the anti-slavery clamor
                    throughout the North, issued his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. The Indiana Republicans may
                    be divided roughly into four classes according to their reaction to the new war policy. The
                    impatient, critical emancipationists gave a deep sigh of relief and ungratefully exclaimed:
                        "<hi rend="i">At last,</hi> the President is arousing himself to a solemn
                        duty."<hi rend="sup">98</hi> Some expressed regret that emancipation did not take
                    immediate effect—but hastened to exclaim: "Thank God for it as it
                        is."<hi rend="sup">99</hi> Others hailed "the President's
                    proclamation as the dawn of a new era in the history of the world" and as the greatest

            <p>Among another class of Republicans the response was more moderate and practical. They saw in the

            <p>Although the Emancipation Proclamation silenced the anti-slavery clamor, it did not satisfy the

                    responsible for failure or defeat, since it was believed that they had received all the troops and
                    supplies requested. Many aggressive Republicans who disliked General McClellan because he was
                    alleged to be a "pro-slavery" Democrat wanted Lincoln to remove him from command

                    prevent the people and soldiers from losing heart in the struggle. "Another three months
                    like the last six and we are lost—lost"—such was Morton's
                        verdict.<hi rend="sup">111</hi>

            <p>When it was learned that an order for Buell's removal had been sent and then countermanded,
                    Sulgrove protested that the latter action was "almost increditable [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]" in the face of such popular dissatisfaction. "It was well calculated
                    to shake all confidence in Mr. Lincoln's administration."<hi rend="sup">112</hi>
                    On October 21, after the battle of Perryville, Morton telegraphed the President of the terrible and
                    needless butchery of Union soldiers and of Bragg's escape from Buell. "Nothing but
                    success, speedy and decided," he concluded, "will save our cause from utter
                    destruction. In the Northwest distrust and despair are seizing upon the hearts of the

                    Democrats to join with them in forming a "Union Party" upon a broad platform
                    pledging wholehearted support to the Administration for a vigorous prosecution of the war. A few
                    Democrats supported the Union movement, but most of them preferred to sustain their own party, which
                    professed support of the Government and the war but opposed the war policy of the Administration.
                    The campaign was conducted almost entirely upon national issues. The result was a decisive defeat
                    for the Union Party. The Republican vote fell off both numerically and relatively from that of 1860,
                    with the result that a Republican majority of 10,000 was replaced by a Democratic majority of
                    approximately the same size. Not only was a strongly Democratic Legislature chosen, but the number
                    of Democratic Representatives in Congress was increased from four to seven out of a total of eleven,
                    while the majorities of such popular Republicans as Colfax and Julian were very sharply reduced.<hi rend="sup">116</hi> Many wavering and independent Republicans had gone over to the Democratic
                    standard and a much larger number had abstained from voting. Abraham Lincoln had received the
                    equivalent of a vote of want of confidence from the people of the state of his boyhood home.</p>
            <p>Explanations of the causes of the defeat were profuse from both sides. The Democrats placed the chief
                    emphasis upon the Emancipation Proclamation and the general anti-slavery policy of the
                    Administration, which they contended had perverted the war from a defense of the Union into an
                    unconstitutional struggle for the Negro; this course drove thousands of conservative Republicans<hi rend="sup">117</hi> into the opposition and kept thousands of war Democrats from, supporting the
                    Union Party. Many people were led to believe that "Radicalism" was preventing the
                    restoration of peace—that the southerners would never return to the Union as long as the
                    Government was dominated by "Abolitionists."<hi rend="sup">118</hi> Although some

                    others admitted that its effects had not been satisfactory. After two years of observation and
                    reflection, Berry Sulgrove concluded that the elections "indicated unmistakably that the

            <p>Many supporters of the Administration wanted to believe that the political defeat was due to the
                    greater number of Republicans than Democrats in the army—that if the soldiers had been
                    permitted to vote the results would have been more favorable.<hi rend="sup">122</hi> Other factors
                    contributing to the Republican defeat included dissatisfaction with arbitrary arrests and
                    imprisonments, the lack of harmony among the different elements of the Union Party, the threat of
                    the draft, the fear of increased taxation and higher prices, the corruption in regard to military
                    contracts, and opposition to the high protective tariff.<hi rend="sup">123</hi> But by far the most
                    important cause of this vote of want of confidence in the Lincoln Administration was the failure of
                    the army to accomplish decisive results in the field. In the spring of 1862, the people had
                    confidently expected that the rebellion would be practically suppressed by autumn; now they felt
                    that little had been accomplished. "The bad management of the administration has caused our
                    defeat," was the prevailnig opinion, "and if it only opens the

            <byline>H. S. K. B<hi rend="sc">ARTHOLOMEW</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>Indiana has had many exciting and memorable campaigns, but there are few people now living who
                    remember any that were more exciting than that of 1896. Three years of unrest had followed the panic
                    of 1893, and the people were discouraged and depressed. The greatest interest centered in the
                    presidential contest, with McKinley and Bryan as the candidates, while the principal issue was
                    bimetalism <hi rend="i">vs.</hi> single gold standard, the Democrats standing for the former and the
                    Republicans for the latter.</p>
            <p>While the race for the governorship was considered of minor importance it also held the attention of
                    the electorate from the time the gubernatorial nominations were made until election day. The
                    Republican candidate was James A. Mount of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery county</region>
                    </placeName>, one of the most successful farmers of Indiana, and the Democratic candidate was
                    Benjamin F. Shively of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, former member of the national House and later <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senator. Both candidates were able speakers and each, one made an extensive speaking
                    campaign.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mount had been a speaker at farmers' institutes from the time they were started in
                    Indiana in 1899. He spoke at the first institute ever held in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Elkhart county</region>
                    </placeName>, the writer hereof presiding. His institute work took him into every county in the
                    state and wherever he went he was a favorite speaker and made hosts of friends. In the course of
                    time he began to cherish gubernatorial aspirations. Louis Ludlow now a member of Congress, but
                    formerly a staff correspondent of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> papers, credits Mrs. W. W. Stevens, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, with being the first to suggest that Mr. Mount should run for governor. Both
                    Mr. and Mrs. Stevens were institute speakers and they and Mr. Mount were frequently together in that
                    work and became very warm friends. Whenever Mr. Mount was in southern Indiana he made it a point, if
                    possible, to spend a day at the Stevens home. It was during one of these visits that, according to
                    Ludlow, Mrs. Stevens asked Mr. Mount why he should not become a candidate. Whether she or somebody
                    else offered the suggestion, it did not take long for it to take effect, for he soon became an
                    active candidate and took advantage of his appearance at institutes to build up his fences. That he
                    was very desirous of gaining <pb n="305" id="VAA4025-033-3-047"/> the nomination soon became
                    apparent to his friends and acquaintances. More than two years before the convention the late Hon.
                    Charles B. Harris, himself an institute speaker and afterward Consul to Nagasaki, said to the
                    writer: "Mount wants to be governorquot;. Mrs. Stevens said, that if he failed to get the
                    office it would break his heart. She had been closely associated with him and had observed how fully
                    the desire had taken possession of him.</p>
            <p>At the end of a most strenuous campaign, he was triumphantly elected and his cup of happiness seemed
                    to be full. But his joy was of short duration. The office of Governor proved to be far different
                    from what he had imagined it would be. From the beginning he was beset by office seekers, as is
                    always the case when there is a change from one party to another. There was dissatisfaction over
                    some of his appointments and this greatly annoyed him. He tried to please the politicians in his
                    party and found it was an impossible thing to do. He wished to do the right thing but was not always
                    able to determine what was best. The late Mrs. Virginia C. Meredith and the writer discussed his
                    administration a year or so before its expiration. She attributed his mistakes to his having had bad
                    advisers, and no doubt she was correct. As a result he was sometimes led to view things from the
                    standpoint of expediency. Had he followed the example of his immediate predecessor, Claude Matthews,
                    and disregarded the politicians, he would have fared better than he did. Matthews alienated many of
                    the politicians of his party, but he won the esteem of the best citizens of all parties.</p>
            <p>Long before his term of office expired Governor Mount wished for its end to come. He was looking
                    forward anxiously toward the day when he could return to his Willowdale farm in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery county</region>
                    </placeName>. The desire of his heart was to exchange the irksome routine of his office and the
                    annoyance of self-seeking politicians for the peace and quiet of country life. He felt that the
                    companionship of his old neighbors would mean a great deal to him after an absence of four years. He
                    was a lover of fine stock and nothing would have given him greater pleasure than to be again among
                    the animals of his choice. But his wishes were not to be realized. Two days after he left the
                    governor's office he was dead. The stress and strain of office holding had <pb n="306" id="VAA4025-033-3-048"/> worn him out. His mistakes and failures were immediately forgotten.
                    Tributes, hearty and sincere were paid to his splendid character and his high standing as a citizen.</p>
            <p>Governor Mount was one of a family of twelve children. His parents, Atwell and Lucinda (Fullenwider)
                    Mount came from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> to Indiana in 1828. They built a log cabin in the unbroken forest and began clearing up
                    a farm, living the life of pioneers. Here the future governor spent his boyhood, helping to clear
                    the land and doing his share of the rergular farm work. His schooling was confined to the winter
                    months and only a short term each winter when no work could be done on the farm. He was a bright,
                    industrious student and made the best of his meager opportunities. In 1862, at the age of nineteen,
                    he enlisted in the Seventy-Second Volunteers. He was a member of Wilder's Brigade and his
                    bravery won high praise from his commander.</p>
            <p>After he returned from the war he entered the Presbyterian Academy at <placeName>
                        <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>
                    </placeName> where he did two years work in one. Having exhausted his funds he had to leave school
                    at the end of the year. Soon after this he married Miss Kate Boyd, a city girl, who had just
                    graduated from the same institution. They had no money. They leased a farm which was stocked and
                    supplied with implements and together they went to work with a determination to surmount the
                    obstacles that lay before them. Mr. Mount once told at a farmer's institute that his
                    mother-in-law was so opposed to her daughter marrying him that she refused to witness the ceremony.
                    Some of the young wife's city friends ridiculed her for marrying a poor young farmer and
                    told her that she would be riding to town in a lumber wagon, sitting on a big pumpkin. They learned
                    in the course of time that life on a farm was no bar to respectability. If any of them lived to see
                    her the first lady of Indiana they probably did not care to be reminded of what they said to her for
                    marrying a farmer.</p>
            <p>During the early years, the Mounts had what the old time farmers called "hard sleddingquot;.
                    In the course of time they took over Mr. Mount's father's farm. By hard work,
                    careful planning and rigid economy they were able to buy, one after another, the shares of his
                    brothers and sisters. It was his habit during the summer season to arise at four o'clock in
                    the morning and it was not an uncommon thing for him, when work was pressing, to work until ten or
                    eleven <pb n="307" id="VAA4025-033-3-049"/> o'clock at night. He was not a large man but he
                    was wiry and solidly built and could do as much work in a day as men much larger than simself. He
                    worked intelligently and was able to accomplish his ends with less effort than many others could. He
                    once told the writer, when we were at a farmer's institute together, that he could crib a
                    hundred bushels of corn in a day. He employed considerable help on his farm but none of his hired
                    men ever did more work than he. There was no work on the farm however hard or disagreeable that he
                    could not or would not do. When his fields needed tile draining he dug ditches and laid the tile
                    himself.</p>
            <p>After he had paid for his farm he kept adding to it from time to time until he had five hundred acres
                    of the best land in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery county</region>
                    </placeName> and several years before he was elected governor he built a palatial residence which
                    cost him $8,000. It was, without doubt, one of the finest country homes in the state of
                    Indiana.</p>
            <p>One of the factors in his exceptional success as a farmer was his ability to dispose of the products
                    of his farm to the best advantage. He watched the trend of the markets very closely and always had
                    something to sell when it would bring the best price. He sold no grain other than wheat. Like most
                    of the successful farmers he marketed his grain on the hoof and in the fleece. He realized that
                    there is more profit in selling finished products while at the same time this practice increases the
                    fertility of the farm, thus making possible the growing of greater crops. He was able to see ahead
                    what the market prices were likely to be and governed himself accordingly. In a letter to the writer
                    in the summer of 1894, when hogs had been selling at a low price for more than a year, he said that
                    he expected the hog market to take an upward trend and he planned to have at least two hundred pigs
                    farrowed that fall. When those pigs were ready for the market the price of hogs had made a great
                    advance over what it was when the letter was written and he realized a handsome profit as a result
                    of his foresight.</p>
            <p>One of the commendable traits of Mr. Mount was his interest in young farmers. In his addresses at
                    farmers' institutes he made it a point to encourage them in every way that he could. He
                    frequently referred to his early experiences and to the efforts that he was required to put forth to
                    overcome the obstacles that often beset him. Between sessions <pb n="308" id="VAA4025-033-3-050"/>
                    he was frequently questioned by the young men who were in attendance and he never failed to give
                    them wise counsel. There are many farmers all over the state who owe him a debt of gratitude for the
                    advice and encouragement he gave them in their early years.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mount served a term in the state senate and made a creditable record in that body. In 1890 he was
                    nominated for Congress and made a vigorous campaign, but that was a Democratic year and he was
                    defeated. Besides campaigning in his district he made a number of speeches in other parts of the
                    state. He told an amusing story of an experience that he met with in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown county</region>
                    </placeName> that fall. He had two engagements in the county which had not a single railroad. When
                    it was time for him to go from the first place to the other, the only conveyance he could find was a
                    vehicle which its owner called an ambulance and which was sometimes used as a hearse. His driver
                    must have been a Democrat, for he said to Mount on the way, "I am hauling you to your
                    political gravequot;. Mount replied that it was with the hope of a speedy resurrection. The
                    driver's words came true at the election that year and the resurrection came six years
                    later when Mount was elected governor.</p>
            <p>As an orator Mr. Mount did not rank with Voorhees, Hendricks or Beveridge, but he was nevertheless a
                    pleasing speaker. His voice had become somewhat impaired while he was in the army as the result of
                    exposure while recuperating from an attack of measles. He was a ready talker and could speak on any
                    subject connected with farming. Whenever interest began to lag he would be called on to rouse up the
                    audience which he had the happy faculty of doing. In the early days of his institute work, he was
                    free to express himself on almost any subject. After he began to cherish gubernatorial aspirations,
                    however, a decided change came over him. He became exceedingly cautious about answering
                    controversial questions lest he should offend the adherents of one side or the other. In fact he was
                    almost as evasive as Martin Van Buren, who had the reputation of being the greatest straddler among
                    American statesmen.</p>
            <p>While the Administration of Gov. Mount was not outstanding as there was no crisis to meet during that
                    period, it was creditable. He sought to discharge the duties of his office faithfully and
                    conscientiously. The mistakes he <pb n="309" id="VAA4025-033-3-051"/> made, as the result of
                    following bad advice, were not such as to bring discredit upon the state, but merely caused
                    annoyance to himself. His career as a whole was an honorable one and his name deserves to be held in
                    remembrance by the people whose welfare he always had at heart.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> is, I had but the haziest notion and my three-day stay within its charming environs
                    proved a delightful surprise for much of the place is today as it was more than a century ago when
                    Thomas Say, together with a brilliant company of men and women, walked its quaint and peaceful
                    streets.</p>
            <p>New Harmonie was founded by George Rapp in 1814. Hailing originally from Würtemberg, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, Rapp, heading a group of sectarians, migrated to <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Butler County</region>, <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>,
                    and there in Harmonie, according to the dictates of a peculiar belief set up a thriving community.</p>
            <p>The singularities of the Rappite religion and philosophy need not concern us, but the fact that these
                    fearless Germans were gifted with heroic capacity for creative work and possessed admirable talents
                    for constructive progress-iveness does have a direct bearing on what I shall attempt to narrate.</p>
            <p>Becoming dissatisfied with their <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> environment the Rappites decided to move elsewhere. In 1814 George Rapp discovered the
                    rich lands on the banks of the <geogName>Wabash River</geogName> and concluded, that, wilderness
                    though it was, the beautiful tract in what is now <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey County</region>
                    </placeName>, was the Promised Land that he and his followers needed for the ultimate success of
                    their communal pursuits. Accordingly, he acquired some thirty thousand acres and in 1815 the whole
                    colony left the Keystone State, migrated to their new domain and forthwith began the building of a
                    new town which they named in memory of their old home in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>For ten epic years they toiled, clearing the land used for laying out their village, which they
                    threaded with streets <pb n="311" id="VAA4025-033-3-053"/> admirably planned and interesecting at
                    right angles. Here they erected dwellings and community houses of wood, handmade brick and stone,
                    factories, churches, hospital and fort. So well did they build, indeed, that most of the structures
                    they created remain today virtually unimpaired by usage and time. Then in 1824, a mighty spirit of
                    unrest, which seemed periodically to take hold of George Rapp, again became predominant, and he was
                    inspired to dispose of his Indiana property and return with his following to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>It happened that the Welsh philanthropist, Robert Owen, who had established his unique social colony
                    at New Lanark, <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>, was contemplating an extension of his educational work at a time when the agent sent
                    out by George Rapp met him. The proposal to sell the New Harmonic estate entire, was made and Owen
                    at once lent a receptive ear.</p>
            <p>The associates of Robert Owen were not in sympathy with his philosophy of education and reform and
                    their interference hastened his resolve to carry on elsewhere and preferably in a region remote from
                    the place where his philanthropy had met obstruction and destructive criticism. So it came about
                    that Robert Owen purchased the Rappite-created New Harmonic and thirty thousand acres of land for
                    $150,000.00.</p>
            <p>In an energetic way, soon after the Rappites had left, Owen set for himself the task of peopling his
                    newly acquired possession which he rechristened <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                        </placeName>.</hi> With the gifts of genius that characterized him, he quickly drew to the
                    picturesque estate on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> some eight hundred individuals of varied talents and disposition. With many thinking
                    folk, there came men with mental quirks and strange notions.</p>
            <p>Among others, he interested William Maclure, who besides ranking as a pioneer geologist of great
                    ability, was an original thinker and a man of outstanding influence in his time. Maclure was not
                    only associated with Owen in the business of purchasing <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but, in the educational direction, he was a magnetic figure who influenced a host of
                    brilliant people to try their fortunes in the novel social experiment about to be launched.</p>
            <p>Thus it occurred that on a boat fitted out for the express purpose of transporting the company, there
                    arrived in <pb n="312" id="VAA4025-033-3-054"/>

                    </placeName> on January 26, 1826, a group of people, that, because of high attainments in the arts
                    and sciences, has come to be known as the Boat Load of Knowledge. The boat was known as the <hi rend="i">Philanthropist.</hi> Among the future stars of the community were: Robert Owen, Robert

                    early on a bright September morning. The spell of the quiet loveliness of the place immediately took
                    hold of me. Quaintness, that harks back to Rappite times, plucks at you at every turn and the famous
                    Gate Trees (<hi rend="i">Koelreuteria paniculata</hi>) make the serene streets extremely alluring
                    when they hang heavy with fruit, as thy did at the time of my visit. I knew at once that my visit
                    was going to be a stimulating mental and spiritual experience.</p>
            <p>Hoping to be housed in an old Rappite dwelling, I was fortunate in having my wish granted by finding
                    rooms in the home of the Robb family on Church street, directly opposite the Tavern which is the
                    ancient Community House No. 3 of the Rappite period. Furthermore, Mr. Winfield W. Robb proved to be
                    a genial gentleman, who, like most of the older residents of the town, was thoroughly versed in the
                    historical aspects of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> and not adverse to imparting freely from his seemingly inexhaustible fund of
                    information. Without further delay, it should be stated that nowhere can one hope to meet more
                    hospitable and charming people than here, where refinement and open-hearted geniality seem to be the
                    spontaneous gift of an entire community.</p>
            <p>Established, I set out immediately to visit the office of a typical citizen, a man of no
                    inconsiderable reputation. I walked into the printing establishment of the <placeName>

                    It carries news items in an inimitable Hoosier way, such as this comment on the excessive aridness
                    of 1936: "It was so dry they wouldn't let a person open a water blister, as it
                    seemed so wasteful."</p>
            <p>To miss the editor of the <hi rend="i">Times</hi> would also be a mishap, for he immediately insisted
                    upon taking me on a personally conducted tour through the historic parts of the town. His
                    philosophical and sympathetic comment, as we walked, he talked and I listened, revealed the profound
                    interest he has in these tokens of the town's past greatness. He voiced a keen hope that a
                    revival of the spirit that made <placeName>

                    souls met there, pointing out the advantages of the historic town as a desirable site for a
                    university, one is led to hope that such a turn will one day come to pass. The settlement of William
                    Maclure, Robert Owen and Thomas Say would indeed make noble ground for the rise of a college or
                    university.</p>
            <p>We walked to the home built on the site of the old mansion built by George Rapp about 1821. The
                    original building was burned in 1844, but in the days of the Owen Community it was inhabited by
                    William Maclure and Thomas Say. The present imposing building faces on Main Street and in the
                    spacious tree-planted grounds to the north may be found the grave of the famous Say. There, in a sod
                    covered valut above which rises a simple marble monument, reposes the dust of one of the very great
                    American scientists of an earlier day. On the north face of the stone these telling lines, half
                    obliterated, were recited by Mr. Wolfe: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Votary of Nature even from a child, He sought her presence in the trackless wild; To him the
                            shell, the insect, and the flower, Were bright and cherished emblems of her power. In her he
                            saw a spirit all divine, And worshipped like a pilgrim at her shrine.</p>
                    </quote> A truly beautiful tribute to a truly great soul.</p>
            <p>On the east face of the monument there was this inscription: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    In his forty-seven years on earth he produced a mass of fundamental literature that rightly entiltes
                    him to the honor of being called the "Father of American Zoology." With
                    indefatigable effort, in spite of much trouble with poor health, he described more than 1575 species
                    of insects beside the notable work he did in Conchology, Paleontology, Ethnology, and to a lesser
                    degree in other branches of Natural History—a vast work for one man to accomplish.</p>

                    the noted sun-dial. Back of this stands the gigantic Hackberry tree that must have been a sizable

                    size. It is marked by a dignity and repose that smacks of culture and chivalrous times. The names of

            <p>I returned repeatedly to the Rapp Community House No. 2. In fact I dined there regularly during my
                    stay. In the spacious dining room, which is much as it was in the days of Robert Owen, there is a
                    gigantic fire-place. It was not difficult to vision Thomas Say, William Maclure, Maximilian, Prince
                    of Wied, and others, residents and visitors, seated before the great blazing log fire far into the
                    night discussing matters of scientific and educational interest. The top floor of the sturdy old
                    building, indeed, was the Pestalozzian School over which Joseph Neef presided. Constantine <pb n="316" id="VAA4025-033-3-058"/> Raffinesque, John J. Audubon, Joseph Leidy, Leo Lesquereux,
                    George Engleman and Henry R. Schoolcraft, to mention some notables, were all visitors to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> at one time or another. In all likelihood, each in his day sat before the grand old
                    fire place which was built in 1822.</p>

                    </placeName> without mention of a noble woman who enriched its early history would be sadly
                    incomplete. That talented woman was Mme. Marie Louise Fretagot who did heroic service in the
                    community when she bravely undertook the responsibility of managing important affairs for William
                    Maclure, who headed the <placeName>

                    </placeName> movement after Robert Owen's withdrawal and who was himself frequently away
                    from the colony for long periods of time. It was a difficult task as has been shown by the
                    historians of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but Mme. Fretageot met all obstacles with a characteristic fortitude, and the work at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> went on. She had a deep seated affection for Thomas Say and his wife Lucy, and at one
                    time she cared for both of them with the concern of a mother when sickness had smitten them
                    simultaneously. Difficulties, and many there were in those days, seemed not to daunt the spirit of
                    Mme. Fretageot.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>The historical pilgrimmage of 1937 was under the management of the Indiana Historical Society, which
                    alternates with the Society of Indiana Pioneers, each society inviting members of the other to join
                    with it. The pilgrimage this year took the form of the long-contemplated boat trip upon the

                    October 8, through breakfast Sunday morning, October 10. A special bus took part of the pilgrims
                    from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    </placeName>, where they were joined by others who arrived by other public conveyance, or in private
                    automobiles. The trip consisted of a cruise down the river to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> where a stop of an hour was made, thence beyond <placeName>

            <p>The Committee upon Early Mills in Indiana is one of the most active in the Society. Mr. Denzil
                    Doggett, the chairman, has added materially to the collection of information and pictures in the
                    Smith Memorial Library of the Society, and Richard C. Smith, of the Library, has tabulated and filed
                    a considerable amount of additional information which has come in through correspondence and
                    personal visits. In the very near future, the Society hopes to put on an exhibition of pictures in
                    the exhibition room of the State Library and Historical Building. The compilation and publishing of
                    a volume upon early mills is one of the goals of the Society, but the publication will not be
                    attempted for some time, that is, not until information is made as complete as can reasonably be
                    expected. An account of a number of early mills in Indiana would have a certain romantic interest
                    and would contribute to the social history of the state. An exhaustive study of early mills will
                    have the additional value of an important chapter in the economic and industrial development of the
                    state.</p>

            <head>THINKING INDEPENDENTLY</head>
            <p>There is a common, though not necessarily expressed, belief that successful persons are those who
                    readily take on the color of the community and who just as readily join the militant defenders of
                    the <hi rend="i">status quo.</hi> Any man or woman of intelligence and experience can easily
                    understand the sources of the ideas of such supposedly successful persons after hearing them
                    converse for a few minutes. To the uninitiated, these fluent purveyors of current notions and
                    representatives of prevailing attitudes seem alert, clever and effective citizens. The truth is that
                    they are superficial or will rapidly become so. They do not have deep or abiding interests. They do
                    not think much. They are easy victims of propagandists. Nevertheless, college graduates constantly
                    join their ranks, among whom there are all too many teachers of history.</p>
            <p>Young men and women who have specialized in history as undergraduate and graduate students,
                    preparatory to teaching careers, should find their training especially helpful as they are
                    constantly confronted with the necessity of judging propaganda. They should know how to check and
                    weigh what they hear and read. They should, while taking their training, have caught the spirit of
                    those who form their opinions on the basis of the evidence, and they should have acquired
                    considerable ability to find the facts even when reading the columns of prejudiced journalists or
                    news gatherers. Otherwise as teachers of history, they are bound to become, to a greater or lesser
                    degree, blind leaders of the blind.</p>
            <p>The teacher trained for history work should have a correct knowledge of the matter to be presented,
                    but should have also the desire and the ability to learn more from day to day and to learn by sanely
                    critical methods. The teacher who gives up study as soon as the degree has been obtained proves
                    thereby the lack of the principal thing that should have been acquired. Even the teacher who
                    continues to read, but does not exercise the critical faculty deserves little praise.</p>
            <p>Everywhere there are people who have supposedly been well educated that gradually become uneducated.
                    The explanation is that they do not read enough; that they do not judge critically what they read
                    and hear; and that they accept without question the views of others. This is one of the common <pb n="321" id="VAA4025-033-3-063"/> tragedies in the lives of those who enter the teaching
                    profession. The same thing is true of approximately an equal proportion of those who enter other
                    professions and trades, except where the regular activities necessarily require constant study and
                    experimentation. The very nature of some professions, such as banking, the law, and teaching, tends
                    to dull and mechanize the minds of those who enter them. That is why it is generally possible to
                    predict what so many persons with experience and education will say relative to any departure from
                    established practice before they speak. Constant study, an open mind, and a tolerant spirit are the
                    necessary bases of growth.</p>

            <p>How wonderful is man, how mystic human lives, Exalted dust that knows the thrill of consciousness! Of
                    all our thoughts and deeds perhaps but that survives Which lifts mankind above its inborn

            <p>When you, in bitter spirit, stamp across the stage Of that inner theater where so many parts you

            <head>LETTERS TO THE VINCENNES WESTERN SUN</head>
            <p>In the <hi rend="i">Indiana, Magazine of History</hi> for December, 1933, there appeared a series of
                    letters, from <geogName>Cheat Mountain</geogName> and points near by, that were written by a soldier
                    of Company G, Fourteenth Indiana Regiment, who used the signature "Prock." The
                    letters were printed in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Western Sun (weekly)</hi> as received. In the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> for September,
                    1934, a second installment of letter to the <hi rend="i">Sun</hi> from "Prock"
                    were published. These related to the part played by the Fourteenth Indiana in the Valley of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. In the last published letter, written on June 9, 1862, the Fourteenth had left
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Alexandria</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, for Harrison's Landing on the <geogName>James
                    River</geogName>. The letters in the following list succeed the last one previously published and
                    continue until "Prock" was wounded at Chancellorsville. After a period of five
                    months, "Prock" entered the service again, and wrote additional letters from the
                    front to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Sun.</hi> In some future issue, the remaining letters will appear. Company G. of the
                    Fourteenth Indiana was known as the "Invincibles." The real name of the author of
                    the "Prock" letters was William Landon who became a Lieutenant of Company G early
                    in the War. In a letter of May 21, 1864, he asked that letters sent to him be addressed to
                    "Lieut. Will Landon," so he was probably known as "Will" by his
                    friends and comrades.</p>

                                    prevented any ill effects arising from this great swell of the mighty waters.
                                    ‘Twas near daylight when we came to anchor off Fortress <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                                    </placeName>, amongst a fleet of vessels and forest of masts, from which the flags
                                    of several nations were flying. The low, dark painted gun-boats and steam
                                    sloops-of-war were numerous. The huge, barbette guns of the mighty Fortress looked
                                    threateningly down on one side, while from the Rip Raps opposite an equal number of
                                    bull-dogs were visible.</p>
                        <p>In less than an hour after sun rise one half of the Fourteenth were splashing about
                                    in the salt water, swimming from transport to transport, apparently determined to
                                    make the most of it, and enjoy their voyage as much as possible.</p>
                        <p>There was an abundance of provisions on board, but the only accommodations for
                                    cooking (that is for building fires) were an old skillet and an army forge, over
                                    which the hungry ones were constantly frying pork or boiling coffee.</p>
                        <p>Weighed anchor at noon, steamed down the bay and up the <geogName>James
                                    river</geogName> 90 miles to Harrison's Bar, where McClellan's

                                    </placeName>, and until Wednesday evening at 4 o'clock, when we landed with
                                    haversacks full of rations, oil-cloth blankets, and each man fifty rounds of
                                    cartridges, and were forthwith double-quicked out about four miles through mud and
                                    rain to the advance for picket duty—the right wing of the 14th taking one
                                    road and the left wing under command of Lieut. Col. Owens another.</p>
                        <p>At daylight the rebels opened on us with shell, and advancing in force compelled us
                                    to fall back a mile until reinforced by the balance of our (first) brigade, when we
                                    drove the rebels back with slight loss, and now occupy their position in the
                                    timber—have thrown up a breastwork. Our pickets are only 300 yards in
                                    advance, and the secesh not over that distance in front of them—in fair
                                    view. In fact, the boys talk to each other from their posts, and have agreed not to
                                    fire, which for the first day or two they were constantly doing.</p>
                        <p>We are called "fresh troops," which accounts for our being in the
                                    advance. Have held our position just one week today—have plenty of
                                    wholesome food and a ration of liquor, but our baggage is all behind, and we are all
                                    as dirty as pigs, and cannot find more than water enough for cooking purposes and
                                    quenching thirst—weather devilish hot.</p>
                        <p>This is rather an unhealthy place for sound men, but those unfit for duty suffer
                                    extremely.</p>
                        <p>Prof. Lowe's balloon is up almost constantly, and occasionally the gun-boats
                                    throw a few shells over us into the rebel camp.</p>
                        <p>No telling at what moment we may be called on to resist the foe—every man

                        <p>Yesterday afternoon we moved out of the woods into an open field and to-day the boys
                                    "threw" [felled] the timber in our front, right, and left, so the
                                    artillery could have a sight at any advancing rebels. A hot, July sun is pouring
                                    down its scorching rays, and the 14th is literally roasting beneath their

                                    the big guns, I presume ‘tis no "grape vine."</p>
                        <p>Drew a ration of "injuns." Soldiers are exceedingly fond of this
                                        <hi rend="i">fruit</hi> [onions]—taste and smell both too

                        <p>The rebels threw a few round shot into some of our transports as they passed the
                                    mouth of the Chickahominy, but presume our gun boats have demolished the battery by
                                    this time—heard very heavy firing in that direction.</p>
                        <p>The water we are compelled to use is of the most miserable quality. I have drank [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] so many wiggle-tails and pollywogs that I can hear young
                                    frogs croaking all the time.</p>
                        <p>Our knapsacks remained at the landing till yesterday, and when finally brought to
                                    camp one-fourth of them were discovered to be missing—Prock's
                                    with the rest. My entire kit now consists of one suit of clothes, very much worn,
                                    covered with grease and dirt (and no water to wash ‘em in); my band box
                                    suit, with many small articles too numerous to mention, diary (the greatest loss of
                                    all) included, "gone up for ninety days." Hope the fellow that
                                    "won" ‘em is "marking time" in hell

                                    captured by Jackson's forces and released on parole, has been discharged.</p>
                        <p>I am glad to hear that the General and the Dr. have <hi rend="i">monopolized</hi> all

                        <p>My friend Sergeant Lyons, of Company "E" Fourteenth regiment, just
                                    informed me that he will be on his way to Hoosierdom at early dawn to
                                    morrow—that any messages, packets, letters, &amp;c., from Prock he
                                    would be happy to deliver at "Old Post." We first formed an
                                    acquaintance at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, over one year ago, whilst on guard together at Camp Kimball, and have
                                    been comrades and warm friends ever since. Sorry am I to part with the jovial, good
                                    natured, light hearted, whole souled Gibby. He leaves the service on account of
                                    ill-health. May he speedily recruit the same, and success always to my comrade of
                                    the Fourteenth!</p>
                        <p>We have been relieved of picket duty, and the regiment is now resting from the
                                    incessant labor of guard and "fatigue." The weather to-day is
                                    disagreeably cool. A heavy thunder storm not only most completely drowned us out,
                                    but almost entirely swamped the Fourteenth.</p>
                        <p>Captain Guido Ilges, of the 14th Regular Infantry, U.S.A., called on his
                                    acquaintances in this regiment the other day. With the exception of being somewhat
                                    thinner, he appeared to me the same immortal "G. I."</p>
                        <p>The explosion of a sixty-four-pounder at 9 P. M. is the signal for us to
                                    "douse the glim" (put out lights), and the same huge iron throat
                                    belches forth at 4 A. M. for the "Army of the Potomac" to
                                    "fall in for roll call." Do things up on a large scale here.
                                    Picket by divisions of infantry and regiments of cavalry.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of horsemen, the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                                    </placeName> Lancers present a very fine appearance as, some twelve or fifteen
                                    hundred strong, they file past in close order, the red pennants of their long lances
                                    fluttering in the breeze.</p>
                        <p>We have nothing to complain of just now but our grub, which is of the most miserable
                                    quality. Should like to see a whole brigade of commissaries hung—about a
                                    regiment of quarter-masters ditto. ‘Twould improve our condition vastly,
                                    besides reducing the expenses of the War Department.</p>
                        <p>The balloon goes up every day—suppose ‘tis just to keep the
                                    Professor's "hand in."</p>
                        <p>I enclose a little memento, which please give to the General, if he will
                                    accept—if not, "burn it." It will doubtless recall to
                                    his mind "the days that we went gipsying."</p>

                                    shot and shell, lasting about two hours when the seige guns on our side the

                                    dogs were silenced. Our loss was four killed (also several horses and mules) and
                                    several wounded. The entire African force, mentioned in my last, fled to the woods,
                                    which have been filled with these <hi rend="i">pets</hi> ever since. None of the

                                    notice, with sixty rounds to each man, and two day's rations.</p>
                        <p>Early this morning a heavy cannonading has been going on up the river, but whether
                                    from our land forces under Hooker, or from the gun-boats, can't say.</p>
                        <p>Heard an officer, who came from <geogName>Malvern Hills</geogName>, where
                                    Hooker's division is now encamped, say that the stench arising from
                                    decaying bodies of men and horses, killed in the last fight near that place, was
                                    intolerable. Instead of being interred, the timber merely was chopped down over the
                                    poor fellows as they lay. He further stated that in the swamps men could be seen in
                                    upright positions, leaning against trees up to their knees in mire; others waist
                                    deep in the same, all deal, having been overtaken by the leaden messengers whilst
                                    endeavoring to extricate themselves from the swamp.</p>
                        <p>Squads of the soldiers of both armies have been discovered around pools of water, to
                                    which the poor wounded fellows had crawled, and overcome by weakness and loss of
                                    blood, lain down and died—some no doubt from want of
                                    attention—demonstrating the fact that neither side in the late
                                    "battles before <placeName>

                        <p>Col. Harrow's resignation having been accepted, the Fourteenth is minus two
                                    more of the commissioned officers that left Camp Vigo to "follow the
                                    fortunes of the regiment through the war." The 14th will miss the Colonel
                                    very much. They were just beginning to appreciate him and learn that he left nothing
                                    undone that would add to their comfort. In him your correspondent always found a
                                    friend, and none regret the loss our regiment has sustained more than Prock. Success

                                    howitzers, a regiment of regular cavalry, and two sections of flying artillery,
                                    started on a reconnoisance [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] across the Shenandoah to <placeName>

                                    stripes. Buckets of water, baskets of fruit, &amp;c., were there. Willing hands

                                </salute>
                        <p>Last night was the first one this regiment has spent in camp out of the last
                                    six—owing to circumstances, of which the writer hereof had no control, we
                                    have been two miles out on picket duty since Thursday last.</p>
                        <p>A late order of the War Department allowing the regulars to recruit their ranks from
                                    the volunteers is playing the devil with the 14th regiment. The regular recruiting
                                    officers all want <hi rend="i">Western men,</hi> and some fifty of our regiment have
                                    already enlisted in the artillery. Only four out of Co. G have as yet enlisted, viz:
                                    John Muth, John Burrell, and Adam Alt in battery C, and Nicholas Geise (of
                                    "Old Post") in battery A—all 4th U. S. Regulars. Others
                                    are anxious to enlist in the cavalry, and will doubtless do so as soon as a
                                    recruiting officer from that branch of the service makes his appearance in our camp.
                                    I do not think the regular <hi rend="i">infantry</hi> will succeed in procuring
                                    many, but the cavalry will "sweep" the old Fourteenth sure!</p>
                        <p>We do not muster now <hi rend="i">for duty</hi> over 20 men to the company on an
                                    average—Co.'s E and H turning out <hi rend="i">nine</hi> men
                                    each for dress parade yesterday after we came off "picket."</p>
                        <p>Col. Harrow is under arrest. The explanation of all these charges, &amp;c., will
                                    come in due time. I am not at liberty now to state the "whys and
                                    wherefores." Suffice it to say that no regiment ever thought more highly of
                                    their Colonel than the Fourteenth does of Harrow; and to a <hi rend="i">man</hi>
                                    they sustain his course, looking upon him as the best friend they have in the

                        <p>I saw Joe Hitchens (Allen &amp; McGrady's Kitchens) the other day. He
                                    talks of going into the army bakery business here this winter. I guess, from his
                                    general appearance, he has quit soaking liquor—perhaps as most of us
                                    have, from the fact that ye "fluids" cannot be readily obtained.</p>
                        <p>The rebel pickets are still in sight of our camp, although three or four heavy

                                    coats" away. Occasionally one of our pickets is "knocked
                                    over," but, as a general thing, this barbarous practice has been done away

                        <p>Capt. Cash will be "wid" us about the 10th or 15th of November.
                                    Should we have the good fortune to remain in camp, we will then get four
                                    months' pay, and ye "spons"<hi rend="sup">16</hi> are
                                    much needed in the regiment.</p>

                        <p>To-day is the first cold, raw, wintry one we have experienced this winter, and being
                                    in the most exposed situation of any troops in the corps, we are all (those on duty
                                    excepted) housed in our "dens" and endeavoring to keep warm by
                                    wrapping up in our overcoats and blankets—fires are out of the question
                                    in these small summer shelter tents, only capable of containing two men each; and
                                    equally so out of doors, for the driving rain would speedily quench them.</p>
                        <p>Two Sibleys would hold all the men Co. "G" can muster for duty on
                                    this ridge.</p>
                        <p>General Order No. 154, War Department, allowing the regulars to enlist men from the
                                    volunteer regiments has reduced our number of "fighting men" at
                                    least one half. Nearly one hundred of the "Old Fourteenth" have
                                    joined the regulars within the past three days, and others will undoubtedly follow.

                                    amputation—was wounded in the foot. How much the boys miss the active,
                                    energetic, always wide awake, and excitable Frenchman! No better soldier in the

                                    as they are reported physically unable to do duty as soldiers. Charles Otto Miller
                                    is at Craney Island Hospital, and is entirely used up so far as active service is
                                    concerned, by a white swelling. Frank Rice, Martin B. Johnston, and John Shahan
                                        are—<hi rend="i">somewhere,</hi> I suppose. Of the two former we have

                        <p>Lieut. Van Dyke is Acting Regimental Quarter Master—George Riley having

                                    doeth it not shall be beaten with many stripes." The above mentioned
                                    individual "Wharfo", and the accompanying Biblical extract will
                                    remind my old comrade of the post-office (General Murphy) of an extinguished and
                                    venerable brother of Bruceville—a worthy member of the ancient and
                                    honorable order of Eclampsis.</p>
                        <p>The changes that have taken place lately afford unbounded satisfaction, and an
                                    abundance of "soft tack" to the regiment.</p>
                        <p>I was down to Harper's Ferry yesterday, and called in at the Adams Express
                                    Office. It is piled up with boxes for the soldiers, and out at the depot of the B.
                                    &amp; O. Railroad there is at least five wagon loads <pb n="335" id="VAA4025-033-3-077"/> of the same. ‘Tis not of much use sending
                                    boxes to friends in the army stationed where there are perhaps from 30,000 to 50,000
                                    troops. A mere accident if the soldiers receive them. Persons sending boxes should
                                    be careful and obtain one entirely new, or have all old marks and letters on them
                                        <hi rend="i">planed</hi> (not marked) off; this would add greatly to the chances
                                    of their being received.</p>
                        <p>Our contraband (ye black cook) is whistling merrily away on "Rosin the
                                    Bow," (General's favorite) and, I opine, has dinner ready. So I
                                    will "hold up" if the rain does not, and "fall
                                    in" for grub—after which a huge pipe of the "cheering
                                    weed," and a nap, wrapped in my army blanket made of hog-hair and tow,
                                    mayhap a dream of—"What is It?" "When shall we
                                    three meet Again?" "Any other Man," or some other fancy
                                    sketch, and "more too." Adieu!</p>

                        <p>We reached this place from Harper's Ferry yesterday noon, after a hard tramp
                                    through mud and snow.</p>
                        <p>Five months ago, one bright Sabbath morning in June, the old Fourteenth, with colors
                                    flying, drums beating, full ranks and steady tread, marched proudly through this
                                    town. I thought at that time it was the lovliest spot the fortunes of war had placed
                                    in our path; and indeed all my comrades were in ecstacies, over and over again
                                    declaring the village unsurpassed in beauty by anything they had yet seen in the Old
                                    Dominion.</p>
                        <p>Now how changed! One can scarcely recognize the place. Silently we filed through the
                                    long streets—no martial music to herald our approach—the day
                                    (Sabbath again) cold and dreary—the side walks lined not with fair
                                    damsels, as before, to scowl and frown, but with rebel soldiers on parole, who
                                    seemed not at all pleased at the long column of blue jackets Southward bound.</p>
                        <p>We remain here a day or two to "gather strength"—i. e.,
                                    amass supplies—and then off once more in the direction of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>

                        <p>Sergeant Colman, James H. Cook, and Rodgers, of Co. G, were left in hospital at
                                    Harper's Ferry.</p>
                        <p>Adolph Myer and E. Rush Loop have joined the company.</p>
                        <p>Several recruits have reached the regiment. They will find it rather a rough and
                                    tough undertaking to <hi rend="i">act</hi> the soldier in the field.</p>

                        <p>Enclosed find a fac simile of a gentleman of leisure. Their number in this army is
                                    legion. Observe how well Uncle Sam's uniform becomes this ape. Numerous
                                    orders have been published forbidding citizens from wearing the "true
                                    blue," but these "outside barbarians" are allowed to do
                                    as they please—go and come at their leisure and pleasure.</p>
                        <p>Drum is beating to fall in for inspection—must bring these scrawls to a

                                        <country reg="gi">Gibraltar</country>
                                    </placeName> Brigade" arrived, and we brought up the rear.</p>
                        <p>The Fourteenth were ordered on picket before they could pitch their
                                    "flys," the afternoon of our advent (the 18th). Next day, about 3
                                    P.M., some of the 108th <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                                    </placeName>'s wagons passed through our picket lines, without a guard, to
                                    forage. Pretty soon, back they came on double quick, with a squad of rebel cavalry
                                    at their heels. Pop! Pop! went the pistols and carbines of the pursuing horsemen.
                                    "Halt! halt!</p>
                        <p>you d——d Yankees!" "Nary"
                                    halt—the teamsters without once looking back applied their whips and
                                    spurs and were soon "under the guns" of the old 14th. The
                                    out-post, composed of Co. B, gave the "grey backs" a volley that
                                    put them to the right about; not, however, till they (the rebels) had captured
                                    "Baalam and his ass" (a straggler on a mule, who slipped out with
                                    the forage party).</p>
                        <p>In less time that it takes to write it, the whole regiment was past the out-post,
                                    deployed as skirmishers and in full chase of the daring riders. After pursuing for a
                                    mile we were ordered to about face, and returned "loaded to the
                                    guards" with chickens, ducks, turkies, honey, cabbage, potatoes,
                                    &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Appropos of potatoes, Capt. Patterson and I, while on out-post duty not long since,
                                    purchased twenty-five cents worth of "Murphys," (one gallon)
                                    boiled and ate them <hi rend="i">at one meal, without salt!</hi> besides disposing
                                    of a couple of quarts of coffee, and twelve or fifteen crackers.</p>
                        <p>Some idea may be formed from this of a soldier's appetite when enjoying good
                                    health and living in the open air, marching 15 or 20 miles <hi rend="i">per
                                    diem,</hi> keeping wide awake all night, and rations short.</p>
                        <p>Turkies are worth $2 here; chickens $1 a pair. This is the
                                    price paid by Brigadier Generals and others who have money, but the Fourteenth is
                                    short of funds at present, and in order to keep up with the times and add to their
                                    meagre bill of fare, "flank" the unlucky birds whenever occasion
                                    offers.</p>
                        <p>For several days past it has been drizzling, and to-day a steady rain has set in,
                                    which will, if continued, I opine, delay the march of ye Army of ye Potomac.</p>
                        <p>Thomas C. Baily, formerly Sergeant Major, has been promoted to Adjutant. Truly, a

                        <p>A few cannon shots are exchanged occasionally by our advance and the rebels on tother

                                    fires—"shelter tents" or "flys" are

                                    quarters, to be composed of small cabins, containing not over six men each, covered
                                    with the tattered "flys" and oilcloth. The men would have been

                                    froze—that is according to army regulations. Many horses and mules have

                                    </placeName>, this army was ordered last Wednesday night<hi rend="sup">25</hi> to
                                    prepare three days' rations, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>At early dawn Thursday, our batteries opened on the town. The day was passed by the
                                    Fourteenth under arms within a mile perhaps of the river.</p>
                        <p>About four o'clock word was brought that the 7th <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                                    </placeName> had crossed in the pontoon boats and driven the rebel sharp-shooters
                                    out of town. The column was put in motion towards the river, but on reaching the
                                    level plateau in front of the town, the rebel batteries opened on us, and we were
                                    counter-marched again behind the bluff and rested on our arms all night. Early next
                                    morning we crossed without opposition and stacked arms near the centre of town, on
                                    Caroline street.</p>
                        <p>Our boys immediately "deployed" for tobacco, and pretty soon an
                                    abundant supply was found in a cellar, seized and distributed to the hungry. We
                                    passed the whole day on this street—roll call every hour. At night the
                                    troops all sought shelter in the houses in front of which they chanced to be placed.
                                    The night passed off quietly. A few shots were exchanged by our pickets and the
                                    enemy's skirmishers, but this had never entirely ceased from the moment we
                                    entered the town.</p>

                                    </placeName> were sent out as skirmishers, and pretty soon our brigade followed,
                                    marching in two ranks in order to cross a narrow bridge over a race, just at the
                                    outskirts of town. The head of our column had scarcely crossed this when the rebel
                                    batteries of rifled thirty-two pounders opened a cross-fire on us. The shells fell
                                    thick and fast, exploding with deafening roar right in our midst. Shattered, torn
                                    and bleeding, our column still pushed on—gained the open
                                    ground—drew up in line of battle, and with bayonets fixed, rushed forward
                                    to the charge. And such a charge may I never witness again!</p>
                        <p>Two fences were in front of our regiment. Over these we had to climb—the
                                    huge shells exploding above and around us. Gaining the top of a ridge, every foot of
                                    which was swept momentarily by the enemy's artillery, we could see the
                                    FIRST LINE of the rebel fortifications in all their strength, still half a mile in
                                    advance. We were not in reach of them yet, and men were falling fast. Not a cannon
                                    had opened on our side. Still on went the "<placeName>
                                        <country reg="gi">Gibraltar</country>
                                    </placeName> Brigade," at a double-quick, and soon were in reach of the
                                    rebel infantry, who protected by their rifle-pits, filled the air with minnie balls,
                                    while grape and cannister rattled and crashed through our thinned ranks. Here the
                                    column paused and opened fire within about three hundred yards of the
                                    enemy's works, and here the "<placeName>
                                        <country reg="gi">Gibraltar</country>
                                    </placeName> Brigade" held their position till near sun-down, and not one
                                    step did that line advance beyond this point—although brigade after
                                    brigade was rushed out into this human slaughter pen. Darkness alone closed the
                                    scene of bloody strife, and our broken columns fell back and were re-formed in the
                                    streets.</p>
                        <p>Our loss—that is, the loss of Sumner's Corps, is equal to that at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Antietam</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. The rebels, in my estimation, must have killed about five to one. Our
                                    regiment captured two prisoners and that is all I have seen or heard of being taken.</p>
                        <p>Towards the close of the action, our artillery endeavored to obtain a position, but
                                    the pieces were no sooner unlimbered, than a shot from the heights either dismounted
                                    the guns or killed men and horses by dozens.</p>
                        <p>The whole of Sunday and Monday was spent in removing and taking care of the wounded.
                                    The dead were left on the field. Sharp shooters from both sides made it a hot place
                                    out there.</p>
                        <p>Monday night we quietly withdrew. Whether all our troops came across or not, I
                                    can't say. A detail has gone over to-day to bury the dead.</p>

                                    Our dead had all been stripped naked, and the rebel cavalry (<placeName>

                                    steeds planted their iron shod hoofs. A long ditch was dug, entirely across the

                                    arm. A guard of the 13th accompanied the detail to the field. They were very civil
                                    and drove the vicious cavalrymen away with the bayonet. The infantry of both armies
                                    are "heavy" on the cavalry, and vice versa.</p>

                        <p>On my return to the army, I passed a few days in the Capital of my country. And here
                                    I must digress and remind you that the first sight I had of this much-talked-of city
                                    of wonders, was just at daylight on the morning of the 27th of August, 1862, out of
                                    a bivouac in a huge brier patch, directly opposite the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> Monument, on the Virgiania shore of the Potomac, with three
                                    days' rations of fat port and wormy crackers in my haversack, and a shirt
                                    on I had worn for fifteen days. A short sight it was, too, for the next morning we
                                    were at Centreville, thirty miles off, to cover the retreat of Pope's army.
                                    Well, the second view your correspondent had of this abode of the "Powers
                                    that be," and that stupendous humbug, the Monument, was not under
                                    difficulties, and I must admit that, like the Frenchman, I was "very mooch
                                    disgust." As a city it don't amount to anything. Country town
                                    like, there is but one street deserving the name, and the surroundings are anything
                                    but what one would be led to suppose those encompassing the Capital of this country
                                    should be. Stagnant pools, acres of filth, hospitals, and the barracks of thousands
                                    of soldiers and contrabands—the former are perhaps needed to cover the
                                    city, and their presence <hi rend="i">indispensable,</hi> but I could not see
                                    it—the latter are a nuisance anywhere, even in South America, where they
                                    are hairy all over and have claws. Why are not the fifty thousand soldiers I saw

                                    relieve us of incessant fatigue and picket duty. I was glad to escape from this
                                    city, overflowing with recklessness, wickedness, corruption, depravity, holiday
                                    soldiers, and place hunters; and, I assure you, by no means pleased to think I had
                                    sacrificed three days of unalloyed pleasure in Old Post for the same disgust and

                        <p>Almost incessant storms of rain and snow have so far composed our weather ration for
                                    the spring of ‘63—not a blade of fresh green grass, not a bud
                                    nor bird visible throughout the encampments of the army of the Potomac. This is one

                                    all the same. A driving storm, half rain half snow, keeps those on duty moving
                                    briskly to and fro for warmth, whilst the whirling wind descends the barrel-topped
                                    chimneys, filling the eyes of those in quarters with smoke, and rendering their
                                    abodes anything but comfortable and fires a nuisance, though ‘tis almost

                                    perhaps more than ought else, attended prayer meeting in that establishment. The

                                    head-quarters. "Twas at that time surrounded by a neatly-painted fence, and
                                    many beautiful and stately trees besides lilac and rose bushes and other ornamental
                                    shrubbery were scattered throughout the grounds which were laid off in gravelled

                                    "Slopping the Pickets." Prayer meetings are held every evening at

                        <p>Saw a brigade drill of the rebels, three regiments, and about seven hundred men each;
                                    also a dress parade in Dixie. They manoeuvre and handle their arms well, but the
                                    variety of colors exhibited in their habiliments (cannot call them uniforms)
                                    presented a most grotesque <pb n="346" id="VAA4025-033-3-088"/> and ludicrous
                                    appearance, no two being dressed alike in a whole regiment. Quite a crowd of the

                        <p>Leaving camp early on the morning of the 28th of April, we marched eight miles to
                                    this Ford—next morning we went on picket, and caught two (not rebs) but
                                    oppossums, and swallowed a few yards of a very heavy "grape vine,"
                                    which I will not relate here. At 4 P.M. we crossed the river and marched to within a
                                    mile-and-a-half of Chancellorville, on a road leading to Bowling
                                    Green—passed the night in a large corn field, spreading our blankets
                                    right down in the mud and mire. Our spring campaign had begun in earnest. At four
                                    A.M., as the drummers were preparing for revielle, a roar of artillery and the sharp
                                    crack of rifles in our advance, rendered other music unnecessary to arouse the
                                    sleeping soldiers. Breakfast hastily disposed of, there was a thorough inspection of
                                    arms and ammunition.</p>
                        <p>At 2 P.M. we moved down the road to Chancellorville to within half a mile of where
                                    the fighting was going on, when the brigade was countermarched back to its old
                                    position in the open field, and again slept on their arms.</p>
                        <p>All of the next day was spent in shifting around, changing positions, chopping
                                    timber, and digging rifle-pits—the battle raging with terrific fury on
                                    our right and left, particularly on the right, where towards night the Eleventh
                                    Corps were driven back a mile or more in great disorder and
                                    confusion—some regiments throwing away nearly all their arms, and one
                                    "making tracks" without firing a shot.</p>
                        <p>During the entire night of Saturday, May 2d, a tremendous racket was kept
                                    up—trees falling in all directions—the dull, grating sound of
                                    pickets and spades mingling with the sharper strokes of the axe—the
                                    incessant pop! pop! of pickets, and at intervals a crash of musketry from a whole
                                    division, followed by the heavy boom of a battery, and the hissing, whizzing and
                                    bursting of shells—whilst above and over all the bright, full moon looked
                                    calmly down upon the scene of strife. Not a wink of sleep for any soldier that
                                    night, save the sleep that knows no waking. At day-light the musketry increased to
                                    one long, continuous roar.</p>

                                    General French's headquarters, and engaged the enemy in the centre.
                                    ‘Twas a severe contest, but the rebels, soon finding the woods too hot,
                                    retreated to their rifle-pits. Our boys speedily, drove them out and across the <placeName>

                                    their flank, and a second line of gray coats appeared four ranks deep, and opening a
                                    tremendous fire compelled the brigade to fall back—which was done in
                                    excellent order, till our support coming up the brigade was withdrawn to our own
                                    rifle-pits, where the rebels shelled us for half an hour, severely wounding several.</p>

                    began the presidency of William Woods Parsons, who really thought of himself as the successor of the
                    first instead of the second head of the institution.</p>
            <p>The period of President Parsons lasted to 1921, but his presidency covered several fairly well marked
                    stages of development. The first, a renaissance of the Jones règime, was plainly on yet
                    when I became a student, but was giving way to a second before my senior year. In the early years
                    under President Parsons, a remarkable unity permeated the faculty. All held to similar educational
                    notions whether Hegelian or not. The most forceful members of the group had been trained in the
                    Normal School in the days of President Jones or had accepted his ideals. President Parsons and
                    Vice-president Howard Sandison were for years untiring students, and they were joined by others in
                    the study of works on education, but <list type="footnotes">

                            courses could be given at either of these places, but I made a small beginning in each

                    unusual faculty was not made up of men and women gathered from eastern Universities, but of persons
                    filled with the spirit of William A. Jones who sincerely believed that they were a chosen few that
                    were to give light to the educational world.</p>
            <p>In time I came to know well several of this masterful group of teachers, and I often wondered what
                    places they might have filled had they studied in eastern or foreign universities. Certainly the
                    parts played by them would have been quite different had they been students of more tangible things
                    on the frontiers of knowledge, instead of trying to unravel the secrets of human development by
                    years of introspection joined with a study of logic, literature and philosophy.</p>
            <p>My teachers during my first term in the Normal School included Albert R. Charman (educational
                    psychology), Mary J. Anderson (English grammar), Elizabeth Long (arithmetic), and Arnold Tompkins
                    (reading). The last three subjects were in the field of the "common branches", but
                    if these subjects were ever taught in an uncommon manner, it was in the Indiana State Normal School
                    of my student days and before. A fundamental belief was that teachers must be grounded in the common
                    school subjects, and also that a knowledge of these branches would serve as a firm foundation on
                    which to build should one continue his education.</p>
            <p>Every student was required to take work in English grammar. The system taught in the Normal School
                    was quite unique. The attempt was made to relate every thing to the idea behind the word and to the
                    thought behind the sentence. Defining terms, classifying words and expressions, and analyzing
                    sentences furnished mental gymnastics beyond the capacity of many students. Far more students fell
                    by the wayside in grammar courses than in any other subject. I enjoyed my work with Miss Anderson
                    and I remember her as a woman of intelligence and culture. Miss Long, who later became the wife of
                    the Librarian of the institution, was alert, efficient and kindly, though somewhat eccentric. My
                    first psychology teacher was a fine, honest man. The head of the department <pb n="351" id="VAA4025-033-3-093"/> was Vice-president Sandison, and no man ever had a more faithful
                    understudy than did he in Albert R. Charman.</p>

                    staff of the Normal School of DePauw University, and had lost his position along with William H.
                    Mace when President J. P. D. John decided to abolish the Normal School of DePauw in 1890.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Professor Tompkins was an inspiring teacher, and students who sat in his
                    classes could never forget him. He was an interpreter of life, and during all the years since I sat
                    at his feet, I have recognized my deep indebtedness to him.</p>
            <p>Tompkins was a poet-philosopher with interests outside his subject. He could not and did not avoid
                    giving attention to the ideas that motivated the Normal School and its work. A clash of conceptions
                    brought about his dismissal in the spring of 1893. I was not in school at any time during the
                    academic year 189–893, and had no part in what transpired, but the institution passed
                    through a real crisis. A professor, regarded as a disturber, lost his place, but the Normal School
                    was never the same again. The student body and faculty were profoundly stirred and the
                    "revolution of 1893" led to a period of tolerance in sharp contrast to what had
                    preceded. The "czarship" of the faculty came to an end, and the man at the head of
                    the school became a wiser President, proud of his liberalism.</p>
            <p>In the years following 1893, new men were added to the faculty, several of whom were mainly
                    interested in their subjects with little concern about teaching problems. During the year
                    189–896,1 could plainly see that the Normal School was in a state of transition. Dryer,
                    Curry, Kelso, Rettger, Wisely and Stalker were members of the dominant group, while Sandison and
                    Kemp were at the climax of their careers.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                            the faculty. Elwood W. Kemp read history extensively for years. He was a serious and
                            thoughtful teacher who required much real work of his students. It was not long after 1896
                            that Professor Kemp became absorbed in the problem of teaching history in relation to the
                            "stream" of human development from the earliest times. Unfortunately, he
                            devoted the rest of his teaching career to the method of teaching history in which he had
                            come to believe so strongly. </item>

                    numbers) each year, and certain functions during the commencement season. Besides these social
                    affairs, the churches provided occasional student receptions, but otherwise students looked after
                    their own entertainment. There were no dances and no inter-collegiate athletic events save a few
                    base-ball games in the spring and a state track and field meet annually. The latter was quite an
                    extensive and interesting event even in the ‘nineties. There was no dean of women, no
                    dean of men, and no other dean. President Parsons taught a class in the history of philosophy and
                    education throughout each year, and Vice-President Sandison gave but a small part of his time to
                    executive duties. Before I left with my certificate of graduation, the office force was increased by
                    one hundred per cent which brought it up to two—Miss Minnie E. Hill, who had charge of
                    the records and collected fees, and Miss Emma Smith, a stenographer, who served as the

                    enrollment of 421, which ran up to 770 in the spring term. The enrollment for the winter term of
                    189–896 was 534, which the spring influx increased to 1167. The number of graduates in

                    day, but they were on the wane. It was only by a great effort that one could be kept going after
                    being organized, and the debates held by such societies had become so thin that they were of little

            <p>As late as 1895, there were still large numbers of students who had never had the privilege of
                    attending high school. In fact, the period of rapid multiplication of high schools in Indiana did
                    not come till after 1900. There was still a three-year course for all comers of proper age that
                    could be completed by high-school graduates in two years, and a four-year course that such graduates
                    could complete in three years. It was the last named course that I completed in June, 1896. At the
                    time of graduation I had delved into a good many subjects, but I was not very far advanced in any
                    field. I hardly knew whether to apply for work as a teacher of mathematics, English, or history.
                    Like many others completing college, university or normal courses in that day, I hoped soon to
                    become the principal of a high school and later a superintendent of city schools somewhere. The job

                    </placeName> was a fine little city in 1896, having a population of close to 15,000. It had grown
                    rapidly and the income of the school city had not kept pace with the increase in the number of
                    children of school age. Teachers were respected and well received by the people, but they were
                    poorly paid. I started on a stipend of sixty dollars per month for nine months. Rents were low and
                    food prices very reasonable, but fuel was relatively high and the winters long. My young wife and I
                    were happy in <placeName>

                    years from 1896 to 1901, I cannot now understand.</p>
            <p>I well remember three charming ladies who called on me in my class-room, at the end of the day,
                    during my second week in the fall of 1896. They came to sell me two tickets to the annual lecture
                    course of which the city was quite proud.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> The tickets were only a dollar and a
                    half each for a course of eight or ten numbers. Mrs. Lynch and I had been in school during the
                    preceding year, and, though I had earned about ten dollars a week for a period of two months during
                    the summer, our funds were very low by the time we were established. Having arranged with one of the
                    best grocery stores in the city to pay at the end of each month, we hoped that our little supply of
                    money might suffice for absolutely necessary cash purposes till pay-day which was to come at the end
                    of four weeks of teaching. To hand out three of my few guarded dollars meant something very serious,
                    but there were the three "uplifters" smiling and talking and what could I do.
                    After the dear ladies had departed with my cash, I looked at the two pieces of red cardboard that I
                    held in my hand with a feeling akin to despair. They represented a lot of culture for a young
                    instructor and his helpmeet, so perhaps <list type="footnotes">

                    The reasons need not be recorded here. My teaching program was strenuous enough and there were
                    numerous extra school duties. We had no football or basketball in that period, but developed some
                    track and field activities, and it fell to my lot to look after the boys in such sports. Both Mrs.
                    Lynch and I attended church regularly and performed more than a full round of duties. During those
                    five busy years we did not tie up our talents in a napkin, but used them to the limit. There was
                    plenty of experience in the life that we led, but not enough opportunity for growth. High schools,
                    colleges and universities employ too many teachers who are required to work under conditions that
                    necessitate a dissipation of energy. School authorities and the public have never been properly
                    educated in regard to the shiftlessness of over-burcening teachers with duties that prevent them
                    from rendering the best possible service to the school and the community.</p>

                    high school, though the work of the eighth year was organized on the departmental plan. The high
                    school work extended through four years and there were two courses, the Latin Course and the English
                    Course. There were about 200 students in the High School in 1896, with three or four times as many
                    students in the freshman as in the senior class. By 1900, the number of students had increased to
                    about 400.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> The principal of the High School was Sylvester B. McCracken who had
                    filled the position since September 1892. He was an able man who had, before spending two years at
                    Indiana University, served as principal of the Delphi High School for several years.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> A strong and very loyal group of teachers served with him. Principal McCracken was

                            the late ‘nineties was partly due to the long depression that followed the panic
                            of 1893 and partly to the growth of the city, but more to the fact that high schools became
                            more popular the country over. In more recent times high school attendance has Increased at

                    disciplinarian. He had natural qualities that fitted him well for the management of high school boys
                    and girls, but he made too much of a task of it. The result was that there was usually some
                    tenseness in the atmosphere which caused principal, teachers and students to carry on under a
                    strain. This was scarcely perceptible at times, but often it was all too apparent. Nevertheless good
                    work was accomplished, though too many, rather than too few, dropped out of school after the
                    freshman or sophomore year.</p>
            <p>The Superintendent of Schools, D. W. Thomas, was a man with a sense of humor and a large fund of
                    common sense. He guided his teachers with tact and showed a friendly interest in their problems. He
                    recognized the sterling worth of Principal McCracken and served as a shock-absorber for him on
                    numerous occasions, often when that excellent schoolman knew nothing about it. An irate parent,
                    sometimes a father but more often a mother, coming to the office of Superintendent Thomas found him
                    always ready to listen. He once said to me: "When a parent who is deeply stirred about
                    something comes to see me, I cross my legs, lean back in my chair and give attention to whatever the
                    visitor may wish to say. I do not argue nor interrupt. In time any individual tends to run out of
                    something to say. When this stage is reached, it is generally possible to talk the matter over and
                    reach a sensible conclusion." Supt. Thomas never interfered with me. He gave me kindly
                    advice and support when needed and deserved. We became close friends and stood together through
                    thick and thin.</p>
            <p>Just why, I do not know, but in those years when I was but a humble and poorly paid instructor in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName> High School, there was a Northern Indiana Teachers Association and another in southern
                    Indiana in addition to the State Association. The latter met during the Christmas holidays, and the
                    others in the early spring. My recollection is that the Northern Association grew to such large
                    proportions that it overshadowed both of the others. I did not, of course, attend the Southern
                    Association but generally made the State Association and always the Northern Association. The

            <p>The years of the last decade of the nineteenth century are commonly referred to as the "gay
                    ‘nineties", which should not be taken literally. The expression really means
                    that people of today find amusement in the styles, the pastimes, and the serious activities of the
                    years that immediately preceded the advent of automobiles, moving pictures, airplanes and radios. I
                    was a young man in the ‘nineties and know from personal experience what life was like. I
                    bought a top-buggy and a new set of single-harness in 1893, and did much driving until I was married
                    and left home to live on my own. After that I did not again possess a private means of conveyance
                    until I purchased a "Model T" Ford car in 1916. The family that could maintain a
                    horse and buggy or a carriage and team in city or town really belonged to the aristocracy. Strange
                    to say, this is not true of the automobile.</p>
            <p>One of the strangest features of the ‘nineties was the proneness of men, young men
                    included, to wear frock coats not only on Sundays and at social functions, but anywhere at any time.
                    I was first fitted out in a suit with a cutaway coat in the spring of 1888 when I finished high
                    school. From that year until 1900, I purchased, at different times, four additional suits with frock
                    coats. I also purchased suits with regulation sack coats, but, like everyone else, I wore the frock
                    coats on the street, in the school room and everywhere. For a time, all the young men that I knew
                    who tried to dress well affected the straight frock coat. This looked like a
                    "Prince-Albert" coat, but was single-breasted. I fell for the idea and ordered
                    such a suit of blue-black clay-worsted cloth in the spring of 1892. These coats, for good and
                    sufficient <list type="footnotes">

                    my friends, I paid a tailor to transform my coat into a cuta-way, after enduring it for about a
                    year, and wore it out in that form. Men carried umbrellas not only to keep off rain, but as a
                    protection from the sun in the nineties. A young man was not well equipped without a good looking
                    gentleman's umbrella. I confess that I tried to keep up with this requirement and remember
                    that I did occasionally walk along the street alone with my umbrella raised on a hot day. Now the
                    man is hard to find who has any umbrella save his auto top, and, when one is seen carrying an
                    umbrella in the rain, is almost invariably belongs to his wife. It takes a lot of courage, or maybe
                    it is a lot of meekness, for a man to go forth alone with a short-handled parasol covered with
                    variegated silk, but there are some men like that.</p>
            <p>It was not my intention to teach so long before continuing my education, but, being somewhat in debt
                    when I went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1898, there seemed no way to avoid it. To pay a debt, or to save money after the
                    debt was paid, was a slow process on the salary of a high school teacher in the
                    ‘nineties. There was little chance to earn anything during summer vacations, but I was
                    usually able to keep even by working either on the farm of my father or that of my father-in-law.
                    One summer, I went forth to sell encyclopedias, for which I hope to be forgiven eventually,
                    especially since I did not succeed in disposing of a single set. During my fifth year in <placeName>

            <p>The family of James Albert Woodburn is of Scotch-Irish ancestry on both sides of the
                    family—Ulster Scots, who moved into northern <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> in successive migrations from the time of Cromwell. On his mother's side, the
                    Hemphills, Millens, Moffetts, and Chestnuts, came from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">County Antrim</region>
                    </placeName>. The Woodburns came from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">County Derry</region>
                    </placeName>, near Coleraine.</p>
            <p>These Scotch-Irish came to America in several waves of migration from 1715 to 1775, though some came
                    later. A few reached <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName>, some landed at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>, <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
               </placeName>, but the great bulk of them landed at

                  <settlement type="city">Newcastle</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>, and made their way gradually to the interior of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. From thence many migrated southward through the <geogName>Shenandoah Valley</geogName>
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and settled in the Piedmont region of that state and the Carolinas. They were hardy
                    frontiersman who later continued their migration toward the West. They served as a buffer between
                    the colonial settlement and hostile Indians. Out of this stock came such leaders, as Stonewall
                    Jackson, Andrew Jackson, John C. Calhoun, Sam Houston, James K. Polk, the Robertsons in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The early Scotch-Irish were a sturdy stock, being, for the most part, small farmers
                    and humble tillers of the soil. They usually disliked the British government, were Jeffersonian
                    Republicans in politics and Presbyterians in faith. Such was the racial element to which the family
                    belonged.</p>

                    wandered about for a time without fixed habitation; had five children two of whom died in childhood;

                    August 16, 1786. He tells very little of his early life. It appears that he served two and a half
                    years in the war of 1812, enlisting a little over three months after the declaration of war and
                    being mustered out nearly three months after the negotiation of the peace. In the year 1823, or
                    before, Dorrance B. Woodburn began to have qualms of conscience about his membership in the
                    Associate Reformed Church. He was a diligent reader of the Bible, and to his mind human institutions
                    ought to conform to Bible standards. The question of slavery and the relation of the church to that
                    evil were now troubling his mind. It was probably in 1823, that he prepared a paper on
                    "Slavery in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>

            <p>The Reformed Presbyterians (Covenanters) admitted no slave-holders to their communion. Woodburn,
                    chiefly on this account, now cast his lot with them. Rev. Hugh McMillan and his new church elder
                    (Dorrance B. Woodburn) were active and bold enough in the anti-slavery cause to prepare and present
                    a petition on slavery to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>

                    bears no date, but it could not have been written later than 1825 or 1826.</p>

            <p>Jerusha (Gardner) Morris died Sept. 2, 1858, and Levi Morris married (3) Nancy Thompson. No issue. He
                    died Apr. 8, 1872. Anna Morris, daughter of Levi and Martha (Kelley) Morris, who was born Sept. 4,
                    1838, was my grandmother. She died about 1874, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Seymour</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Ind. She married Daniel Patrick, son of John and Matilda (Holman) Patrick. Matilda was
                    a daughter of Isaac Holman, soldier in Revolutionary War, who is buried in Clark Co., Ind. The
                    Morris and Patrick families lived in southern Indiana (Seymour and Tampico) but I do not know the
                    names of John Patrick's parents, nor the place of his birth. I have the names of the
                    children of John and Matilda Patrick from the family Bible. The dates for the Morris line are from
                    the Morris Bible, which is 105 years old.—Mrs. Lester E. Niles, 519 Chiquita Road, Santa
