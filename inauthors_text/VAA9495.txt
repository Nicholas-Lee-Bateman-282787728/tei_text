            I.
            
              1. O DAY OF DEATH, how dark thy gray and
                shadowy wing;--
              Eclipsed the natural sky, hushed everything.
            
            
              2. Within that twilight stands the Past; its outline clears.
              Thy deeds, Dear Lost, revealed, and my arrears.
            
            
              3. My conscience crouches chill, or like a babe when left
              At some cold door to die, wails on bereft.
            
            
              4. Of endless, needless love, regret pours all her store;
              How mean that all appears, not poured before!
            
            
              5. Time past irreparably; Love's service incomplete:
              Oh that I 'd first, love spent, died at thy feet!
            
            * John I. Morrison, died
              1882.
          
          
          
            II.
            
              1. Irrevocably gone! That veil how thick or thin;
              No sound to me. Hears he this poor world's din?
            
            
              2. Heard there my grieving heart? my sighs? Think that he sees
              In bliss this look? Known there such tears as these?
            
            
              3. While I find all things dulled: sense beating as on drum,
              Muffled beyond response. The heavens are dumb.
            
            
              4. Where is the soul that lived so nobly silent here?
              Thy confined face I saw, thy funeral bier,
            
            
              5. Thy open grave, thy form in grand repose; but where,
              Where thou who fondly watched, escaped our care?
            
          
          
            III.
            
              1. Thou didst not haste to go, but meekly tried to live.
              There is a power beyond; not Death can give
            
            
            
              2. The word to snap the thread, to bid the weary rest:
              A servant, he obeys a King's behest.
            
            
              3. Then why that sudden word, if we thy offspring dear,
              Great God? "The blow deserved," I seem to hear.
            
            
              4. I thought-- but now I see: the most I failed to know,
              I reached too far and missed, I learned too slow.
            
            
              5. To follow out my plans, I missed a grander scope;
              Daily before me clear rose larger hope:
            
            
              6. Daily a life shone forth I failed to understand,
              Beneficently beamed, benignant, grand:
            
            
              7. My life's sun clear shone forth with kindly steady ray,
              Shown constant to its close;-- woe worth the day!
            
            
              8. I saw it near decline; I knew it soon must set.
              I looked. It milder beamed, and yet, and yet,
            
            
            
              9. I could not then believe it soon would shine no more,
              So peaceful and so calm. Then all was o'er.
            
            
              10. As when the sun goes down, diffused the radiance sheds
              Unwonted light, anew the landscape spreads,
            
            
              11. So when he sudden sank into the night of Death;
              0 Loss! Why did I not yield then my breath?
            
          
          
            IV.
            
              1. What were thy thoughts, My Dear,
              That day, the last and dread?
              Oh that my heart had propped
              Thy drooping head;
            
            
              2. My hands and kiss had warmed
              Thy hands, so still and cold;
              My arm had clasped thee near,
              In loving fold,
            
            
              3. Death had not then surprised
              So stealth'ly thee and me;
              I near, he might not then
              Have taken thee.
            
            
            
              4. He stole to thee unthought,
              Alone he found thee, Dear;
              Him didst thou see ? They say
              Not so;-- I fear.
            
            
              5. What were thy thoughts, Dear One,
              The moment just before,
              And all that day? I ask
              But this-- no more.
            
            
              6. My heart breaks at the thought
              That thou didst know the last,
              And no one near to help,
              When help was past.
            
            
              7. My heart breaks at the thought
              That all that day of dole,
              Though all spoke cheer, yet none
              Spoke to thy soul.
            
            
              8. That with us all about,
              No one of us a stay,
              Thy feet sunk deeper down
              That lonely way.
            
            
              9. That with us all about,
              And thou a dying man,
              We read not failing powers,
              And countenance wan,
            
            
            
              10. We read not bright eye dimmed,
              Nor failing pulse and breath;
              Nothing could make us think
              "This may be death."
            
            
              11. We did not mean to be
              So heartless and so dull;
              Let love, which blinded us,
              Our fault annul.
            
            
              12. 'T was foolish, wrong, I know,
              To hope, and seek to cheer;
              We should have comforted :
              Forgive us, Dear.
            
          
          
            V.
            
              1. Hast thou been comforted, Dear One, this weary while?
              Not long, nor oft; but still sometimes I smile.
            
            
              2. I wonder I can smile, or speak of aught but thee,
              Or name with even voice thy name. Ah me!
            
            
              3. In all familiar things I miss thy eye, thy hand;
              Our thoughts in unison: none understand.
            
            
            
              4. Keeping from hurt or fall my too oft willful feet,
              Shaming my foolish pride with reason sweet.
            
            
              5. Where are thy careful ways? The type to me is lost;
              Ah, Father dear, I 've learned;-- at what a cost!
            
            
              6. There 's no one else like thee. I hate the race of men,
              All dwarfs; my Father I want back again.
            
            
              7. I see the beauteous life which seemed a common thing;
              Into the dreariest lot my heart I'd fling,
            
            
              8. To show that I a life could live, not all in vain,
              My Father could I have once back again.
            
            
              9. All zest from life is gone. All's wrong. There's nothing
                good.
              Life faints, and tears are mixt with daily food.
            
          
          
            VI.
            
              1. Not for all living men would I my dear dead give;
              'T is worth e'en death to have such memory live.
            
            
            
              2. Some unrequited days he weary spent. 'Tis worth,
              To know so grand a soul e'er lived on earth.
            
            
              3. For now he lives with God. And I? I live to know
              More of the heaven that's lent to us below.
            
          
          
            VII.
            THE PORTRAIT.
            
              1. 0 face of gentle mien,
              Of quiet, lofty power;
              Of dignity enhanced
              Through nature's dower.
            
            
              2. 0 father's face so kind,
              O precious lines of care;
              O eye so clear, so true,
              O kingly air.
            
            
              3. 0 noble head with brow
              Where thought with goodness dwelled;
              And breast, where a chaste heart's
              Emotion swelled.
            
            
              4. Shoulders that bore their part,
              Nor bent to service mean:
              Soft hair of age, and beard
              Of silvery sheen:
            
            
            
              5. Her gushing tribute pays
              My long pent soul. In thought
              I reverent kiss that beard,
              So life-like wrought.
            
            
              6. Upon that breast I lean;
              That eye I seek, and then
              To God I say, "Shall this
              Not live again?"
            
          
          
            VIII.
            AFTER MEMORIAL SERVICE.
            
              1. The Past is past, Dear One;
              Of thee, our best, bereft,
              To cherish what we can
              Is all that's left.
            
            
              2. Not garments still to hoard,
              Nor everything to keep,
              Which thou didst dying leave
              With us who weep.
            
            
              3. Thou wast not one to hold
              Within a tightened grasp
              E'en all thou mightst have claimed;
              We only clasp
            
            
              4. A few things called thine own;
              Too few: mementoes these,
              
              Of one who lived not most
              Himself to please;
            
            
              5. Of one who gave long since,
              That with a father's care
              We might the more enjoy
              And freer share.
            
            
              6. Oh! when a broken band
              We sat, the seal we broke,
              Each heart in sweet accord
              With him who spoke;--
            
            
              7. Though dead and powerless then,
              Our wills how potent bent
              To see fulfilled his dying
              Testament!
            
            
              8. "To my beloved wife;"--
              Poor Mother, feeling more,
              As day adds day to day,
              Bereavement sore.
            
            
              9. Her conscious mind his loss
              At every turn must face;
              His goodness cause of grief,
              For void his place.
            
            
              10. Before his portrait sitting
              She's older grown and fades;
              
              Too much, I'm sure, her thoughts
              It over-shades:
            
            
              11. Too poignant brings the sense
              Of separation keen:
              Silence has fallen for time
              Their lives between.
            
            
              12. That arm's support, her days
              Lonely indeed without;--
              I wonder what my heart
              Has been about.
            
            
              13. Ah, Sister mine! thou knowest,
              Widowed in youth's fair flower:
              The bond close knit between,
              In sorrow's hour.
            
            
              14. Long has the dust reposed
              Of that youthful husband dead:
              Long has the grass been green
              Above his head.
            
            
              15. Thou long hast worn the garb
              Of woe, widowed indeed,
              From his grave a flower thou'st plucked
              For Mother's need.
            
            
              16. Sympathy's bloom so pure:
              Mother, the blossom see!
              
              Its perfume is all about;--
              Sweet Sympathy!
            
          
          
            IX.
            AFTER THE GOLDEN WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.
            
              1. In the old home burial ground
              Kindred and neighbors lie;
              Thick sown their ranks, and rare
              Their company.
            
            
              2. Not in that time-dear place,
              His grave whom most we mourn;
              To a lovely spot, his choice,
              His form was borne.
            
            
              3. First of us all to rest
              In the lonely silent plot;
              Place then how dear, never
              To be forgot.
            
            
              4. Near a city great it lies;
              We may see it any day;
              It was strewn with Golden-Rod
              On the Wedding Day.
            
            
              5. We crowned our mother with gifts,
              Affection's golden shower;
              Loss weighed on our hearts, a stone,
               We had scarcely power
            
            
            
              6. Not to weep that day all day,
              So much we had thought in the past,
              Of fruition upon its wings;--
              It was over at last.
            
            
              7. But we comfort another's heart
              By moving our own to do;
              And living our lives aright,
              We live life through.
            
          
          
            X.
            EASTER.
            
              1. The joyful seasons come,
              The Christmas Tide, the year
              New ushered in; then morn
              Of morns most dear.
            
            
              2. Dear Risen Lord, their joys
              With buds of hope are wreathed;
              Though on their golden prime
              A sigh is breathed,
            
            
              3. A tear let fall on bloom,
              As on our gifts that day,
              When the Wedding Golden came
              And gone our stay:--
            
            
              4. Dear Brother Christ, we lean
              Our woeful hearts on thee;
              
              With him, bring us to thy
              Felicity!
            
          

          
            XI.
            AN INTERLUDE : A RETROSPECT OF DECORATION DAY.
            
              1. On Decoration Day,
              By a soldier's grave I stood,
              And thought while others spoke,
              "How brave! How good!"
            
            
              2. A marble shaft uprose
              To claim, "Here honor due!"
              Where in the graveyard old
              The long grass grew.
            
            
              3. Near by ancestral dust
              Made ever dear the place;
              The tombs, so old and worn,
              Had homely grace.
            
            
              4. Above the stones moss-grown,
              With quaint inscriptions crost,
              The fragrant branches gay
              In wildness tost.
            
            
              5. There as I reverent stood,
              And scanned them round, and thought
              Of changes which the years
              Since then had wrought,
            
            
            
              6. How far removed their plane
              From human action seemed;
              How worthless and how small
              Things most esteemed.
            
            
              7. "Nothing," I said, "is gold,
              Nothing high place or fame;
              Nothing, save heart of truth
              And worthy name."
            
            
              8. The monumental shaft,
              More recent dust above;
              Silent I stood. My heart
              Asked, "Is this love?
            
            
              9. Old friend, best comrade e'er,
              School champion, then lover,
              And later pleasant friend,
              Didst thou discover
            
            
              10. That night, when by thy chair
              A little while I stood,
              With pity's smile all faint,
              In melting mood,
            
            
              11. That I was nearest love
              To thee I'd ever been?--
              Pity and love are said
              To be akin.
            
            
            
              12. At that plain view of doom,
              So fell, so near at hand,
              I touched thy chair's wide arm
              With leaning hand;
            
            
              13. And then with talk around,
              We spoke of recent war;
              Thy smile the same, thine eye
              The same kind star.
            
            
              14. The past had hold on me,
              During our interview,
              But if thy thoughts went back,
              I never knew.
            
            
              15. Wast thou a hero then,
              Grander than in the strife?
              Nor gave least sign of wish
              To link with thine my life?
            
            
              16. Or haply hadst thou now
              Banished all deeper thought,
              Save of thy coming fate
              So nearly brought?
            
            
              17. My hero still the same!
              Even if other love
              Had ever caused thy heart
              From me to move.
            
            
            
              18. If country dear, or long
              Unreasoning despite
              Had changed thy constant heart
              To yield me quite,
            
            
              19. I'd think the more of thee
              To tire of my unworth;
              This love? In self-contempt
              It sprang to birth.
            
            
              20. I know not at what call
              I went that time from thee;
              As one might careless say,
              'T was destiny.
            
            
              21. But this I know: my heart
              Regretful lingered there,
              I stood in spirit still
              Beside thy chair.
            
            
              22. Cheerful our talk the while
              And kind,-- at last mine kind.
              And then about the war;
              I call to mind
            
            
              23. This ripple on smooth stream:
              "And when they fight," asked I,
              "How do men look?" "Like beasts,"
              Was thy reply.
            
            
            
              24. "Ah, sunny soul!" I mused,
              "It did thee violence,
              And now thy life cut short
              Pays the offense."
            
            
            
              25. Farewell, true friend in love;
              Who learning my hard heart,
              So loved as to efface
              Offense. No art
            
            
              26. Taught thee disguise, but love
              From boyhood years to prime
              Kept fast thy faith in love,
              And made sublime
            
            
              27. A simple heart. No plaint
              Embittered speech, unsoured
              Within that nature sweet.
              Thy being flowered
            
            
              28. Into serener peace.
              As frank and kind, a touch
              More rare put on; to say,
              Love's grace were such,
            
            
              29. One could not love, and not
              Be glad, and yet too dear
              The passion to be named
              Save in Love's ear!
            
            
            
              30. And this the character
              I flouted at, and deemed
              Too simple, commonplace,
              And disesteemed!
            
            
              31. I know thee better now,--
              I'll think thee home above,--
              "Farewell! and what is not
              Regret, is love."
            
          
          
            XII.
            
              1. Father, thou wouldst not mind,
              Or think a simple lay,
              Did thee a wrong, as some
              Might wiser say.
            
            
              2. And that it has no place,
              Whatever its intent,
              In this poor verse of mine,
              Yet heart's lament?
            
            
              3. No! Had some power but swept
              Away the guard reserve!--
              'T is gone. I'm nearer thee:
              Thus would death serve?
            
            
              4. Ah! now since death has come
              And placed a veil between,
              My heart I open all,
              Nor seek to screen.
            
            
            
              5. If I could only know
              That thou 'rt not so removed,
              As not to see and know
              My love thus proved!
            
            
              6. I'll take the good I can,
              And think that thou dost hear,
              And see and know, and bend
              To me thy ear.
            
            
              7. For once if I had told
              Such thing to thee, my Dear,
              Thou wouldst have had in that
              Kind eye a tear.
            
            
              8. Thou wouldst have said with smile,
              "How came our child to be
              Of poets' tribe? She got
              It not from me!"
            
            
              9. Yet thou, my Father dear,
              For those great sons of Time
              Hadst large respect, voicing
              Their songs sublime.
            
            
              10. Old Homer's sounding verse
              I've heard thee measured roll,
              And Milton's mighty chime
              Swept deep thy soul.
            
            
            
              11. And yet thy heart a child's
              To feel the simplest thing
              That could to others joy
              Or sorrow bring.
            
            
              12. There's no one else like thee
              My Dearest and my Best!
              God give to thee his peace
              And choicest rest!
            
            
            
              13. I seem to hear thee say,
              "Oh! did my child thus feel?
              I fear my heart at times
              Seemed sheath of steel."
            
            
              14. No matter for those days,
              My Father dear, they're past.
              I always knew thy heart
              Was soft, steadfast.
            
            
              15. I crept not far enough;
              Many the times I might;
              Thy daughter could not, Dear,
              Sue for her right!
            
            
              16. Yet who can tell the strength
              Of the allegiance fond,
              Binding my heart to thine
              In earliest bond!
            
            
            
              17. But now-- O now! How much
              Have we! Thy blessedness!
              And I? To speak my heart's
              Love and distress.
            
            
              18. 'T is not enough; my heart
              Cannot be comforted;
              I'd climb to heaven, creep in
              The grave, thy bed.
            
            
            
              19. O grave that draws my heart,
              My father is not there:
              Only his body waits
              Renewal fair.
            
            
              20. But if it draws my heart,
              Must he not bend his gaze
              Sometimes to better view
              Earth's brief amaze?
            
            
              21. 0 heavens unsoiled by death!
              Bend with him, till I know
              That there he waits for me
              Till I too go!
            
          
          
            XIII.
            MAY 30.
            
              1. At the Capitol I saw
              Last year on Soldiers' Day,
              
              Sculptured in white, a thought
              To live for aye:
            
            
              2. 'T was Memory with pen
              Writing the page for Grief;
              Grief leaning weeping lorn
              'Mid her flowery wreath.
            
            
              3. A weeping Grief I lean
              'Gainst Memory's dear cheek;
              She writes these thoughts which I
              Could never speak.
            
          
        
        
          PART SECOND.
          
            XIV.
            
              1. THIS IS THE FATAL DAY, when thou a year ago
              Didst sacrifice thy life. How couldst thou so?
            
            
              2. Didst yield that vital spark too long to cold and storm?
              Nothing that current chilled could ever warm.
            
            
              3. O Duty, stern of face, how dost thou drive and goad
              The patient, steadfast soul, till 'neath thy load
            
            
            
              4. With force all spent it sinks, but turns its thankful eye
              To bless thee for its smarts, and so, to die.
            
            
              5. To bless thee, who dost burst upon its filmy view
              A splendor of God's love, in aspect new;
            
            
              6. And take into the arms of everlasting rest,
              And pillow the poor head upon Love's breast.
            
            
              7. But this the fatal day;-- no wonder that the doom
              Breathing upon the trees enrobed in bloom,
            
            
              8. Gave omen dark and dire, during the fitful night,
              And showed to morning's view the frost's fell blight.
            
            
              9. O fatal, fatal day!-- Though love foreboded ill,
              None knew him so near death, nor knew he still.
            
            
              10. And friends and neighbors pass with customary tread,
              Not knowing they shall soon exclaim, "He's dead!"
            
            
            
              11. "Day of anger. Day"-- And I? I too lived on,
              And breathed the perfumed air, reveling in sun.
            
            
              12. How little then I knew, in the far sweet South away,
              The mandate that went forth that bitter day!
            
            
              13. How little thought, on sea or river's flow, or sand
              Of sunny beach, 'neath shade in flowery land,
            
            
              14. Scenting the oranges' bloom, scanning the beauteous shell,
              How little did I think save, "All is well!"
            
            
              15. Shame on thee, luring Hope! To fool us at our ease,
              Leaving me now to say, "What now can please?"
            
            
              16. "If I had only known." "We'll meet with
                freshened heart,"
              I thought. This now my grief,-- "so much apart."
            
            
              17. Oh! when the warning comes, had we but lived to give
              Service that breathed, "If God shall grant life, live."
            
            
            
              18. If we had only stayed our loved one close beside,
              Whisp'ring, "I 'l serve him well, whate'er
                betide!"-
            
            
              19. My worthless life prolonged, I'll try the more to be
              More of that spirit which he wished in me.
            
          
          
            XV.
            INTERLUDE SECOND.
            
              1. The Spring came sudden, fleet;
              When on an April day,
              Listless o'er even lawn
              I looked away.
            
            
            
              2. "Come!" cried the children, "Come!"
              And seized my nerveless hand;
              "Come to the woods with us,
               A joyous band!
            
            
              3. "You liked the first spring flowers!"
              And so I went to please,
              They dancing on before,
              Light as the breeze.
            
            
              4. How pure the woodland air!
              How sweet the opening view!
              
              All life how murmurous,
              How blissful grew 
            
            
              5. The soft ground yielding life,
              The budding woods yet bare;
              Anemones tremulous stood,
              And violets fair.
            
            
              6. Spring beauties too, their pink
              In loveliness displayed.
              How very fair and good
              All thus arrayed.
            
            
              7. The children flew about
              Like bees from flower to flower;
              The genial sun and air
              Dispense their dower;
            
            
              8. While stainless arches high
              The delicate, limpid blue;
              And earth's dark robe once more
              Is 'broidered new.
            
            
              9. Saith Nature soft to me,
              "Grief-stricken one, take rest;
              The winter's been too long,
              Lean on my breast."
            
            
              10. "There is a grave," I said,
              "Trees grand as these surround;
              
              Their foliage soon again
              Will shade the ground;
            
            
              11. "And sometimes when I think
              Of that most precious dust
              Sleeping in quiet there,
              In angels' trust,
            
            
              12. "It seems that change in us
              Must do it some despite,
              As if not of our ways
              Unconscious quite."
            
            
              13. "I know not," Nature said.
              I made reply, "I know
              Quite well, that he not there,
              It is not so.
            
            
              14. "But from above, his grave
              Now green, does he not see
              His body there?" "It may
              Be so," said she.
            
            
              15. "Then can he not see all?--
              The flowers, the wood, and Oh!--
              See us? Hear what we say?"
              "It may be so."
            
            
              16. I clasped my hands;-- "I wish
              More of his state I knew!
              
              Wise friend, canst thou not give
              Some certain clue?"
            
            
              17. "No clue to that," said she,
              "But this I can surmise,
              That he from out that grave
              Again shall rise."
            
            
              18. "Well do I know that truth,"
              I said. "The promise thrills;
              But a bridge to him my heart
              Impetuous wills.
            
            
              19. "Death's such a gulf!" A bird
              Sang sudden overhead;
              Forlorn I sat. "A bridge,"
              She mildly said.
            
            
              20. The fairest, frailest thing
              Of all came waving by;
              Its wings of gossamer fresh
              As vernal sky.
            
            
              21. "See token here," cried she,
              "The witness of the spring;
              And best, the butterfly
              Upon the wing."
            
            
              22. "Yes, yes, I know," I sighed,
              "God lives, 't is glorious truth."
              
              "Then why," she gently asked,
              "My child, thy ruth?"
            
            
              23. "Oh, dreadful parting here,
              And silence. He is dead.
              The time's so long!" I mourned.
              "Time long?" she said.
            
            
              24. "He did not know me all,"
              I said, and then I wept;
              "Perhaps he knows all now,"
              She silence kept.
            
            
              25. "I did not know how far
              My love for him surpassed
              All other love of mine."
              "Hast loved?" she asked.
            
            
              26. "There's nothing for me left
              But on God's truth to rest."
              "Ah, God is good," she said,
              "To trust Him, best.
            
            
              27. "Take heart, my child, believe
              That God is love, nor lost
              A sigh or tear. The sun
              Is good, the frost.
            
            
              28. "He brings the seasons round;
              And gives the rainbow's cheer,
              
              For storm and drought has use;
              He crowns the year.
            
            
              29. "And shall He not take care
              Of thee, for whom all these?
              Of thee, one chiefest made
              Himself to please?
            
            
              30. "I know not; but how strange
              For thee had He not store
              Of all that He has told
              Me of,-- and more!"
            
            
              31. The scene glowed as she spoke;
              The children called and then
              My troop flower-laden, flushed,
              Home slow again
            
            
              32. Were led; each childish frame
              Lapsed into weary sense,
              My being quieted
              In Providence.
            
          
          
            XVI.
            CROWN HILL, INDIANAPOLIS.
            July.
            
              1. Sweet grounds and grave most dear!
              Through winding avenue
              And shaded vista cool,--
              A nearer view!
            
            
            
              2. The forest growth with scent
              Of woodland, wild and sweet;
              Where bird and squirrel find home,
              And flowerets greet
            
            
              3. Sad eyes, and zephyrs fresh
              Salute the mourner's cheek,
              Cool after sultry drive:
              These scarcely speak
            
            
              4. Of that beyond: the fair,
              Swelling expanse of hill
              And vale and shaven lawn,
              The City Still.
            
            
              5. Domain where rest the dead;
              How shines each lettered stone!
              Deeply engraven here
              Grief's monotone.
            
            
              6. The strong, the wise, the young,
              The fair, the loved, here meet:
              Here pause. Ended the race
              And stilled the feet.
            
            
            
              7. Were I so near that I
              Could daily come, and be
              Beside his grave, like her
              In minstrelsy,
            
            
            
              8. She simply wise; I too
              Might "sit and sing" for love
              Of him, and yet I know
              He is above.
            
            
              9. But now, 0 grave! My eyes
              Take thee into my heart.
              'T is right that thou shouldst be
              Just thus apart;
            
            
              10. In greenness solitary,
              Flecked with tender shade,
              The dearest, saddest spot
              Was ever made!
            
            
              11. How rank the grass is grown!
              Not yet a year,-- some days
              It seems since lingeringly
              The last fond gaze;
            
            
              12. But oh, for him, how long
              To be away! Around
              I walk,-- my heart takes in
              The lowly mound.
            
            
              13. Memorial marble soon
              Will guide to where he lies;
              That sleeping dust unseen
              God's eye descries.
            
            
            
              14. 0 precious jewel hid!
              Not lost in slow decay;
              Immortal to burst forth,--
              God speed the day!
            
            
              15. Not now that face I'd scan;
              Could it in no more pride
              Appear than once, I should
              Be satisfied;
            
            
              16. Save that I know that form
              In glorified array
              Shall come immortal forth,--
              God speed the day!
            
          
          
            XVII.
            INTERLUDE THIRD: THE BUTTERFLY.
            
              1. From lonely, peaceful place
              Our homeward course we wended;
              Our drive from grave to gate
              Not unattended.
            
            
              2. Rising upon our view,
              To come and go
              To and fro,
              Was an escort fine and new.
              A butterfly bright came,
              Our airy servitor,
              
              Or from what kingly court
              Ambassador?
            
            
              3. Fashioned by hand divine,
              Wings closed or spread,
              Down, o'erhead,
              Were touched in rare design.
              Their blending tints were like
              My young companion's gown.
              A leaf from elysian fields
              Seemed floating down.
            
            
              4. The beauteous thing so slight,
              As everywhere
              Here and there,
              Seemed fancy's shuttle bright,
              The air an ample loom.
              Threading its pretty way,
              The butterfly allured
              Us by its play.
            
            
              5. Caressingly it came,
              First in, then out,
              And round about,
              Obsequious, not tame.
              Yet lightly anywhere,
              By moments sat so still,
              A jeweled ornament
              It seemed at will.
            
            
            
              6. As it a pattern wrought,
              It passed, repassed,
              Slow or fast;
              And sombre woof of thought,
              Touched as by angel's hand,
              Took on a golden hue;
              My heart her curtains dark
              Slow back withdrew.
            
            
              7. Blest sense of heavenly care,
              Near brought delightsome
              Thing so lightsome,
              Weaving in ambient air.
              Uninfluenced seemed caprice
              Of motion free, or rest,
              Yet teaching me in need
              That trust is best.
            
            
              8. As I with death communed,
              The nimble, airy,
              Flitting, fairy,
              Gay butterfly attuned
              To loving thought of God;
              Bright hint of life to be,
              Which Nature's parted lip
              Breathes unto me!
            
            
              9. Neath eye supreme its pleasure
              Runs brimming over.
              Fluttering rover
              
              In fields of joy! thou measure
              Enwreathing without toil.
              Still rather give me sorrow,
              For thou, waif of a day!
              Hast no to-morrow.
            
            
              10. From our admiring view,
              It, fancy's fay,
              Flitted away;
              But none the less we knew,
              Late writ on limpid air,
              The heavenly love that bended,
              And from the cherished grave
              Our way attended.
            
          
          
            XVIII.
            THE OLD SETTLERS' MEETING.
            (At Salem, August.)
            
              1. The storm retreating, rolls
              Its diapason deep;
              The opposing hill's vast flank
              The free winds sweep:
            
            
              2. Upon the left, withdrawn
              In misty folds, the rain;
              High float the airy clouds
              O'er freshened plain.
            
            
            
              3. In amphitheatre
              We sat, of nature's green,
              And list thy name, while smiles
              The sylvan scene.
            
            
              4. Thy name, thy name, my dear,
              Recurring often there;
              Worthy the old, old place,
              The scene so fair.
            
            
              5. But oh, to miss thee so,
              'Mid those who used to be
              Thy mates, who often since,
              In sympathy,
            
            
              6. Clasped, dear, thy hand, thine eye
              Met with a welcome fond:--
              I sit with them, but gone
              The perfect bond.
            
            
              7. They feel their loss; ah, friends
              Of his be mine! None knew
              Him well as I. My being
              Held the clew.
            
            
              8. The man who loved him well,
              And whom he loved the same,
              I love, whate'er his mien,
              His craft, his name.
            
            
            
              9. The hand that joined his hand,
              In friendship's clasp sincere,
              That hand I clasp in mine
              With smile and tear.
            
            
              10. The hospitable board,
              Where he an honored guest,
              Its food, it seems to me,
              Would taste the best.
            
            
              11. Blessings upon the roof,
              The home, the life, the heart,
              Of any who with him
              Have borne their part!
            
          
          
            XIX.
            NOVEMBER.
            
              1. September's sunny smiles are gone,-- enchanted days,
              October's russet gold and dreamy haze.
            
            
              2. A butterfly lay light, 't was dead, on autumn leaves:
              A flower, frost-touched, it fell from life's fair sheaves.
            
            
              3. Now chill November calls to faith through mists of death.
              The trees like spectres stand: 0 south wind's breath!
            
            
            
              4. About their roots thy warmth again shall cause to flow
              The hidden springs, the trees again shall grow.
            
            
              5. When shall more potent power dissolve an icier spell?
              Breathe me death's winter o'er, and all is well!
            
          
          
            XX.
            WINTER.
            (December.)
            
              1. Beneath the frozen ground
              Thou liest; the sleet, the snow;
              Around the wintry winds
              Wild, ruthless blow.
            
            
              2. Within my mourning heart,
              Thy memory, dear and fair,
              Imperishably shines,
              Its jewel there.
            
            
              3. The drops of tender pride
              Slow well, then glisten, fall;
              Gentlest of hearts! I did
              Not know thee all.
            
            
              4. It hardly comforts me,
              That from the rough world's ways
              Serene are sheltered now
              Thy larger days.
            
            
            
              5. The sigh that heaved thy breast,
              I sigh it o'er again,--
              These tears first dimmed thy eyes,
              My prince of men!
            
            
              6. Beyond, thou liv'st removed
              From this low, sombre plane.
              I lift my eyes, I view
              Thy certain gain.
            
            
              7. Clothed with immortal life,--
              What may that wonder be?
              So happy, I too almost
              In loss of thee.
            
            
              8. Roaming the realms of light
              With many a bright compeer;
              Viewing the Saviour's face,
              Nor cloud nor fear;
            
            
              9. How blest! Ah, not yet quite
              Thy state of bliss complete:
              We wait-- "The Lord in the air"
              His saints shall meet.
            
            
              10. Then Death and the Grave shall yield
              Their unforgotten prey,
              And earth's poor glimmer fade
              Into heaven's day!
            
            
            
              11. Perhaps before that time
              I '11 go to thee,-- would I?
              Yet cling I to this life
              So tame. Ah why?
            
            
              12. So fettered, sad and lorn;
              So weak, so short, so vain:
              With fear and doubt beset,
              With ill and pain.
            
            
              13. I live because God wills;
              Life 's dear,-- grim Death I hate,
              'T is strange,-- yet if I might
              I'd always wait.
            
            
              14. How strange in heaven, perchance,
              This wish to linger here:
              That land fair of the leal,
              This of the bier.
            
            
              15. I sigh at the future lone;
              I yearn for that happier day;
              I mourn for our parted lot,--
              It is not for aye.

            NEW YEAR'S EVE.
            
              Who giveth songs in the night.-- 
              Job xxxv. 10.
            
            
              1. Sad Memory trims her lamp relit from afterglow,
              Warm flushes in my sky now come and go.
            
            
              2. Not day's aurora this, but bloom of night so strange,
              As if to speak of things known after change.
            
            
              3. As if he entering, space was left that we might see
              A glory glimpse, a gleam of heaven to be.
            
          
          
            XXII.
            MIDNIGHT.
            
              1. My sun is sunk in night:
              The shades will not away;
              The day shall not arise
              Until that day.
            
            
              2. I leave you, dear, with God:
              My times are in his hand;
              O'er life, death, being, all,
              His purpose grand.
            
            
            
              3. I leave you, dear, with God,--
              My times He ruleth o'er;
              The morn comes and the night,--
              I can no more.
            
          
        
      
    
    
      
      
        MY SUN IS SUNK IN NIGHT.
