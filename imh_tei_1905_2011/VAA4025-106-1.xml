                         attentively heard, either in public address or private conversation, you
                         should pitch your voice in the lowest register at your command. High-keyed

                         you were in doubt or insincere. You should be careful to enunciate your

                         leader of much smaller stature. Nonetheless, Douglas&apos;s arrest and
                         trial prompted the intervention of Governor Morton in an effort to avoid
                         insurrection and bloodshed in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> and throughout the North.
                         Morton&apos;s efforts ended a notorious episode in which military
                         authorities violated the civil liberties of Northern citizens by curtailing
                         the constitutional rights of free speech and a free press.</p>
                    <p>A study of the Douglas arrest and military commission trial is useful in
                         evaluating historians&apos; understanding of the widespread incidence of
                         military arrests of Northern civilians during the American Civil War.
                         Today, analysis of such arrests is dominated by the work of Mark E. Neely
                         Jr. In his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, <hi rend="i">The Fate of Liberty:
                              Abraham Lincoln and Civil Liberties</hi> (1991), Neely corrected
                         long-held assumptions of generations of historians about where and how
                         arrests occurred, and who was arrested. In a close examination of large
                         quantities of Civil War-era records, Neely concluded that, indeed, under
                         the Lincoln administration numerous arrests occurred in an effort to
                         silence political opponents. He pointed to the rash of arrests to silence
                         Democratic opponents in late summer and early fall of 1862 as the
                         &quot;lowest point for civil liberties in the North during the Civil
                         War...and one of the lowest for civil liberties of all time in <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country></placeName> history.&quot; However, Neely lessened Lincoln&apos;s faults by
                         noting that most arrests occurred in the border states, such as <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region></placeName>
                         and <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007523" reg="Missouri">Missouri</region></placeName>, where fierce guerrilla warfare and nebulous allegiance to
                         both the Union and the Confederacy predominated. Moreover, thousands of
                         arrests occurred for offenses that did not rise to issues of
                         constitutionally protected civil liberties. These included selling liquor
                         to soldiers, smuggling goods to the South, running blockades, and fraud and
                         corruption in making con- tracts with the federal government to supply and
                         feed the army. Such arrests were made amid the &quot;friction and
                         abrasion&quot; of war, and very few rose to the level of a
                         &quot;politically significant&quot; threat to civil liberties. By
                         highlighting the vast number of incidental arrests in comparison to those
                         of political significance, Neely tempered his criticism of Lincoln&apos;s
                         record: <quote rend="blockquote">It seems unlikely that any significant
                              number of arrests of politically important individuals have been

                    <p>Little known as it is, Alexander J. Douglas&apos;s arrest merits careful
                         consideration. It was important because it prompted Morton&apos;s interven
                         tion and intercession with Lincoln to rein in an army commander whose
                         heavy-handed methods were creating havoc in the Midwest. The details of
                         Douglas&apos;s arrest and its significance emerge from an examination of
                         federal and state archives and manuscripts that most historians who have
                         studied such arrests have overlooked. This study is the fruit of piecing
                         together numerous strands found in disparate locations.</p>
                    <p>In examining the Douglas arrest in detail, we gain an understanding of
                         important dynamics at work during the Civil War. First, the case shows the
                         important role of a state executive in the creation of national policy. The
                         arrest and trial created significant friction between military authorities
                         and civil authority at the state level. <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> Governor Morton intervened
                         in the matter, and politically outmaneuvered General Burnside. Coming amid
                         a larger power struggle between the governor and the general, the Douglas
                         case added tension to their already strained working relationship. Second,
                         Douglas&apos;s arrest generated local protests and rallies in both

                         and <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Examining the arrest of a political
                         leader of local significance, and the local opposition to the Lincoln
                         administration it generated, will aid our understanding of how antiwar
                         protest manifested itself throughout the North, and remind us not to ignore
                         apparently local and insignificant events. Last, the episode helps shed
                         light on the rise to prominence of Milligan, whose skillful legal defense
                         in the military commission trial advanced him in the public&apos;s eye and
                         encouraged him to play a leading role in both Democratic party politics and
                         secret organizations to undermine the Lincoln administration in the
                         North.</p>

                    <p>Alexander J. Douglass was born in 1827 in <placeName><region type="county" key="tgn_1002823" reg="Richland">Richland County</region></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName>, near the
                         town of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2080550" reg="Mansfield">Mansfield</settlement></placeName>, the son of farmers. When Alexander was twelve, an attack
                         of rheumatism crippled his father, rendering the older man unable to work.
                         Alexander and his two younger brothers Thomas and Michael farmed the land
                         to support their parents and two younger sisters. When not busy farming,
                         Alexander attended a local school in the winter. Reputed to be a voracious
                         reader as a youth, he began to teach school locally at eighteen. He soon
                         enrolled at a local academy (or high school) at nearby <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013326" reg="Ashland">Ashland</settlement></placeName>, and then at
                         Wittenberg College in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014533" reg="Springfield">Springfield</settlement></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName>. It was at this time he dropped the
                         second &quot;s&quot; in his family name. Douglas intended to study for a
                         career in law, but the college aimed to produce pastors for Lutheran
                         congregations. Notwithstanding that he and his family were Presbyterians,
                         Douglas studied for the Lutheran ministry. However, he failed his
                         examination for the pastorate and did not graduate, as the examining
                         committee was not satisfied by his answers to questions on accepted
                              doctrine.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> His failure to receive full
                         credentials did not hinder him from filling Lutheran pulpits for many years
                         later in his life, nor from teaching in church schools up until his death.
                         Shortly after leaving Wittenberg in 1850 he married Mary Jenner, of a
                         prominent <placeName><region type="county" key="tgn_1002823" reg="Richland">Richland County</region></placeName> family.</p>
                    <p>Douglas&apos;s failure to become a Lutheran pastor allowed him to revert to
                         his earlier ambition to practice law. After teaching school for two years
                         in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2082325" reg="Upper Sandusky">Upper Sandusky</settlement></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName>, he read law in the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2080550" reg="Mansfield">Mansfield</settlement></placeName> firm of Samuel J.
                         Kirkwood and Barnabas Burns. After three years of toil and study, Douglas
                         passed the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName> bar in 1855. The Douglas family resettled in <placeName><region type="county" key="tgn_1003022" reg="Whitley">Whitley
                         County</region></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, nearly due west of <placeName><region type="county" key="tgn_1002823" reg="Richland">Richland County</region></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName>, by about
                         one-hundred-seventy miles. There the family grew, with a succession of
                         children added to the couple. After teaching at the Wartburg Seminary,
                         Douglas established a law practice in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031435" reg="Columbia City">Columbia City</settlement></placeName> and soon began to
                         develop a name as an effective Democratic Party speaker and advocate. He
                         won election as <placeName><region type="county" key="tgn_1003022" reg="Whitley">Whitley

                         role in public affairs in the county and the surrounding region.
                         Appointment as county school examiner followed. Later in that year he
                         offered himself for his party&apos;s choice for state representative, but
                         came in third place in the candidate selection process. In <list

                    <p>In common with a substantial minority of his fellow Democrats at the outset
                         of war in 1861, Douglas voiced his decided opposition to federal
                         coercion. Reacting to a pro-war sermon preached in a local Lutheran church,
                         he announced in a long letter in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031435" reg="Columbia City">Columbia City</settlement></placeName>&apos;s Democratic newspaper
                         that he did not want &quot;blood on my garments.&quot; A speech at a county
                         party convention in September 1861 again embroiled him in dispute. While
                         denying that he termed a recently recruited volunteer company a bunch of
                         &quot;yellow legged abolitionists,&quot; he admitted to having said that
                         there was &quot;disloyalty in places where loyalty was pretended.&quot; The
                         denominational and oratorical controversies do not appear to have damaged
                         his standing in the community, at least among the Democratic majority:
                         Douglas won reappointment as county school examiner, and the newspaper
                         reported that his private, Lutheran school enjoyed a large enrollment.<hi

                         There, state Democrats resolved on a strongly worded anti-war &quot;Union
                         as it was, and the supremacy of the Constitution&quot; platform. Though not
                         without disputes among factions within the party, Democrats denounced the
                         Lincoln administration&apos;s policies to coerce the Southern states as
                         illegal and unconstitutional, and demanded that the federal government

                         Democrats and the minority Republicans led by Morton was undoubtedly the
                         most dangerously contentious in the General Assembly&apos;s history.

                    <p>Douglas raised his voice to speak in the Senate on other issues pertaining
                         to race. In February he spoke to amend a resolution from the Committee on
                         Federal Affairs that the Lincoln administration, in possible peace talks
                         with the &quot;seceded States,&quot; should not interfere with the rights
                         of the Southern states to protect slavery. Two days later, in a debate on
                         the merits or dangers of arming ex-slaves for service in the Union army, he
                         questioned a Republican senator about the possibility of Lincoln
                         withdrawing the Emancipation Proclamation: &quot;Suppose he takes it back,

                    <p>Douglas saved his eloquence for an impassioned address near the end of the
                         session during a debate on how the General Assembly should communicate its
                         views to <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>&apos;s soldiers in the field. Many <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> regiments,
                         irritated by Democratic sentiment in the North, which they increasingly
                         viewed as disloyal, had sent threatening memorials to the
                         Democrat-controlled legislature in disapproval of its utterances and
                         efforts, most notably its attempts to wrest power from Morton. Douglas rose
                         to defend the majority-written report that was to be sent to the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>
                         troops, depicting Democratic legislators as &quot;true and loyal men.&quot;
                         He castigated the Republican minority report for encouraging the army to
                         believe the Democrats were disloyal. &quot;You are afraid the army will
                         have faith and confidence in the Democratic party, and you are working
                         might and main against it.&quot; Sending the majority report, Douglas
                         maintained, would show the troops that the Democrats were &quot;ready and
                         willing to stand up for that unity of Government -- the Union -- the entire
                         Union.&quot; He also accused Republicans of attempting to monopolize power.
                         Responding to an opposing senator&apos;s statement that Republicans
                         controlled &quot;more type and presses and papers than we,&quot; Douglas

                         without a legal quorum to do business, the session collapsed and ended.
                         Douglas returned home to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031435" reg="Columbia City">Columbia City</settlement></placeName> on the March 10 morning train,

                         newspaper editor, and resumed his legal practice. As the Assembly had not
                         passed a budget bill to fund state government, Democratic legislators
                         confidently expected to be called back into special session by the
                         governor. Democrats would then pass legislation to wrest military power
                         from the governor and take control of state government. But Morton quite
                         illegally opted not to call a special session, and instead borrowed funds
                         from private banks, Republican-controlled county governments, and the War
                         Department to pay necessary state expenses. The frustrated Democratic
                         legislators stayed home. Douglas attended to business and played an active
                         role in party affairs, participating in the raucous Democratic meeting at

                         at <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013645" reg="Columbus">Columbus</settlement></placeName> on April 30, he attacked Burnside&apos;s General Orders Number
                         38. The general&apos;s order, announced earlier in the month, came as a
                         reaction to rising antiwar sentiment in the states under his command.
                         Burnside was intent on stamping it out, and aimed to use military power to
                         do so. The order stated that &quot;treason expressed or implied will not be
                         tolerated,&quot; and that expressions of opposition to the government
                         and/or sympathy for the Southern rebels would be punished by military
                         authority. Burnside had publicly stated his view that military authority
                         was &quot;invested with a little more power [than civil authority] in
                         suppressing anything like treason, and acts that tend to create
                              dissention.&quot;<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Vallandigham ripped into the
                         order as an illegal and unconstitutional usurpation of authority and a
                         violation of free speech. The following day Vallandigham spoke to a large
                         Democratic audience at <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2080902" reg="Mount Vernon">Mount Vernon</settlement></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName>, and again castigated
                         Burnside&apos;s military order in rich terms. On this occasion, the general

                                   omissions in the published version. Editor Rachel Sherman
                                   Thorndyke excised the senator&apos;s scathing references to
                                   President Lincoln that revealed his lack of confidence in the
                                   occupant of the White House. He wrote originally: &quot;How
                                   fervently I wish Lincoln was out of the way. Anybody would do
                                   better. I was among the first of his political friends to

                                   water -- afraid of a child....[H]e is unfit to control events and it
                                   is fearful to think what may come during his time. What he will
                                   do now it is impossible to say. He is subject to the deepest
                                   depression of spirits amounting to Monomania. He looked upon
                                   Hooker as his last card....[T]he war is prolonged, and but little
                                   chance of its ending until we have a new deal (a new
                                   President)....I certainly would be glad to support a War
                                   Democrat -- any body rather than our monkey President. If the latter
                                   is renominated which I do not anticipate then I certainly will

                                   seized at the railroad station by a military squad, dragged away
                                   from his two children, who were left among strangers with no one
                                   to take care of them, and hurried away to a military
                                   prison.&quot; Douglas also said he was &quot;cheered in his

                         in passing. The news of Douglas&apos;s arrest appears not to have reached
                         his hometown promptly. The Huntington <hi rend="sup">Democrat</hi>, a
                         weekly newspaper, first reported the story in its May 21 edition. It noted
                         that the charges against him were not known, but presumed that Douglas

                         Douglas&apos;s defense counsel. In Milligan, Douglas had secured an

                         suggest that Milligan had participated in any courts martial or military

                         At the time of the arrest, Governor Morton had been embroiled in a series
                         of disputes with General Burnside and Burnside&apos;s subordinate <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>
                         commander, Brig. Gen. Milo S. Hascall. Burnside had appointed Hascall to be
                         commander of the military district of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> on April 22 without
                         consulting with the governor. Three days later, Hascall promulgated (with
                         Burnside&apos;s blessing) his own order banning opposition political
                         speech in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> to be enforced by military power-General Orders Number 9.
                         The order, modeled on Burnside&apos;s, was Hascall&apos;s effort to stifle
                         Democratic criticism of the Lincoln administration and the army&apos;s

                         Morton, who saw that such heavy-handed and shortsighted military measures
                         would undercut his authority in the state, and would reverse the gains he
                         had made that spring in harnessing Democrats both in and out of the General
                         Assembly. Equipped with intelligence that Democrats were arming and

                         Morton was concerned that blunderbuss tactics employed by military leaders
                         would foment uprisings. In late April, the governor succeeded in persuading

                         with the same fate. A short period followed when opposition speech in

                         political figures rallied across the state to condemn the military edicts.
                         Morton informed Hascall that he viewed both General Orders 9 and 38 as
                         illegal and counterproductive, and that he considered the arrest and trial
                         of Vallandigham by military commission as illegal. Hascall wrote Burnside
                         to report on his alarming conversation with the governor, and warned his
                         superior to beware of Morton. Taking the matter in hand, the governor

                         governors&apos; advice. When conflict between the governors and Burnside
                         arose over the military&apos;s heavy-handed tactics and intrusion into
                         civil matters, and when chaos threatened to break out throughout the Old
                         Northwest, the president was unprepared. The political embarrassment of yet
                         again removing Burnside -- popular among many Republicans who relished the
                         general&apos;s get-tough edict -- was too risky. In a private meeting on
                         May 19, the president&apos;s cabinet members unanimously regretted
                         Burnside&apos;s arrest of Vallandigham. While the arrest had been popular
                         among Republicans, Democrats could now rally around the martyred former
                         congressman and hold him up as a victim of unconstitutional measures by the

                         command. Significantly, during this period in May neither Lincoln nor his
                         cabinet communicated their displeasure about the Vallandigham arrest to
                         Burnside. Indeed, Stanton telegraphed the general shortly after the
                         arrest, stating &quot;In your determination to support the authority of the
                         Government and suppress treason in your department, you may count on the
                         firm support of the President.&quot; Burnside interpreted this message as
                         hearty support for his policy of arrests for political speech.<hi

                         &quot;declaring disloyal sentiments and opinions with the object and

                         Milligan moved that the commission be discharged because it lacked
                         jurisdiction to try the matter. Douglas, he argued, was neither in the
                         military nor the naval service, and the court lacked the power to try
                         matters dealing with free speech. The commission, as it did in the
                         Vallandigham case, swept aside this jurisdictional argument. Milligan then
                         entered a &quot;not guilty&quot; plea.<hi rend="i">43</hi></p>
                    <p>Captain Goddard called before the court a series of prosecution witnesses to

                         speech. Edwin Booth, a <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2079143" reg="Crestline">Crestline</settlement></placeName> physician, testified that Douglas stated
                         the war was &quot;an abolition war&quot; and was &quot;unjust and
                         unnecessary.&quot; Douglas said that the recent local city elections at

                         disallowing Democratic votes. Douglas had advised Democrats to carry
                         cartridge boxes to the polls. He also testified that Douglas said
                         &quot;illegal, arbitrary arrests&quot; should be resisted, &quot;but if a
                         child came to him with proper authority, he could lead him away.&quot;
                         George Cochran, a <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2079143" reg="Crestline">Crestline</settlement></placeName> sawyer, testified that Douglas &quot;thanked
                         God that there were no widows and orphans who could blame him for this
                         war,&quot; and stated military authorities at <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName> had challenged
                         Democratic voters at the polls, and warned <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName> Democrats to go to the
                         ballot boxes in the fall gubernatorial election with their cartridge boxes
                         and resist military authorities if they were so challenged. Douglas had
                         spoken of military arrests like Vallandigham&apos;s as illegal and
                         unconstitutional, and had said they ought to be resisted. William Kerr, a
                         local farmer, (whom the <hi rend="i">Bucyrus Weekly Journal</hi> had
                         mentioned was threatened by the crowd at the rally) testified that
                         Douglas stated the war was to abolish slavery, and not to restore the
                         government; if the country was to be saved, the Democratic Party would have
                         to do it. Douglas had said that &quot;Lincoln&apos;s mean, dirty, low-lived
                         Provost Marshals&quot; had no right to arrest any citizen, but &quot;if a
                         legal officer should send a summons after him, a boy of ten years old could
                         take him.&quot;<hi rend="sup">45</hi></p>
                    <p>Milligan cross-examined each prosecution witness and carefully tested each
                         man&apos;s recollection of the speech. Small weaknesses in the testimony
                         quickly emerged, most notably on the important issue of whether Douglas
                         spoke of resisting military arrests or &quot;illegal arrests.&quot; Booth
                         admitted that he could not recollect &quot;the very words used by the
                         prisoner.&quot; When questioned by Milligan as to whether Douglas actually
                         used the term &quot;illegal arrests&quot; rather than &quot;military
                         arrests,&quot; the witness equivocated and replied that the speaker used
                         both. Milligan succeeded in getting Pierce to admit that he did not recall
                         that Douglas stated the government was trying to establish a despotic rule
                         and deprive the people of the right to vote. Some of the witnesses stood
                         firm in their testimony. Cochran could not be budged, and reiterated that
                         Douglas &quot;advised them to resist military arrests. &apos;I advise you
                         to resist all military authorities, for they are illegal.&quot;&apos;
                         Likewise, Kerr refused to agree to Milligan&apos;s suggestion that since he
                         could not recall if Douglas or another speaker alluded to the government
                         establishing a despotism, that other <list type="footnotes">

                         might actually have come from other speakers. Milligan also attempted to
                         indict the activities of the Crestline Union League, the secret,
                         paramilitary Republican organization, and suggested that the Republican
                         witnesses may have attended the Democratic event to spy on their opponents
                         and report the tenor of the speeches to military authorities, a charge
                         prominent in the minds of Democrats at the time and reminiscent of the
                         Vallandigham case. In regard to the issue of military arrests of civilians,
                         he asked Booth: &quot;Are you in the habit of attending Democratic meetings
                         and do you understand their position on this question?&quot; This
                         question prompted an objection from the judge advocate and was overruled by
                         the tribunal. Booth denied being sent to report on the speeches at the
                              rally.<hi rend="sup">46</hi></p>
                    <p>Milligan called three witnesses to testify in defense of the prisoner and
                         pressed home the distinction between criticism of military arrests and
                         illegal arrests. All three witnesses were Democrats who had attended the
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2079143" reg="Crestline">Crestline</settlement></placeName> rally and stood close to the speaker during his speech. Led by
                         defense counsel, they all flatly contradicted the testimony of the
                         army&apos;s witnesses. C. Fulton, a Bucyrus physician, was the first
                         defense witness called, and he gave his testimony at the end of the first
                         day of the trial. He noted that Douglas &quot;said nothing about resisting
                         military authority, but said he would resist arbitrary or illegal
                         arrests.&quot; He testified that Douglas advised Democrats to go to the
                         polls peaceably and &quot;insist upon casting their votes,&quot; but if
                         &quot;prevented by bayonets&quot; Democrats should take their cartridge
                         boxes and return to the polls and &quot;demand their right to vote.&quot;
                         Douglas had said, in reference to the recent <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName> election, that an
                         army major had told him that ballots should be examined, and those not
                         marked for Union candidates should be thrown out. Fulton denied that
                         Douglas spoke of the government establishing a despotism, but had said
                         &quot;there was more effort made to crush free speech than to crush the
                         rebellion; and that the war was waged more for freeing the niggers and
                         crushing free speech than putting down the rebellion.&quot; This,
                         testified Fulton, was being done by Republican politicians, not by the
                         government. Cross-examination by Captain Goddard failed to blur the fine
                         distinction made between the Republican Lincoln administration and
                         &quot;Republican politicians.&quot;<hi rend="sup">47</hi></p>

                    <p>The commission reconvened the next morning at ten o&apos;clock, and Milligan
                         called his second witness. Samuel Hoyt, a telegraph operator at <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2079143" reg="Crestline">Crestline</settlement></placeName>,
                         denied all the army&apos;s charges regarding the subjects and tone of
                         Douglas&apos;s speech. Hoyt denied that the speaker advised resisting mili
                         tary arrests, said provost marshals had no right to make arrests, or
                         claimed that the government was attempting to create a despotism. Rather,
                         the witness testified, at Milligan&apos;s subtle prompting, that Douglas
                         blamed &quot;advisers of the Administration&quot; for trying to establish
                         military rule and limit free expression of the people, and that &quot;it
                         would end in a military despotism.&quot; According to Hoyt, nothing in the
                         speech was disrespectful of the government and the army. Asked about
                         Douglas&apos;s reference to cartridge boxes, Hoyt testified that Douglas
                         advised all to vote peaceably, but if soldiers deterred voters, to
                         &quot;get their cartridge boxes and go to the polls and vote if it was
                         possible.&quot; Goddard&apos;s cross-examination failed to move the
                              witness.<hi rend="sup">48</hi></p>
                    <p>The third and last defense witness was William Becker, a local farmer. Becker
                         denied that Douglas spoke disrespectfully of the government, talked about
                         government despotism, or claimed that he would not be arrested by
                         Lincoln&apos;s provost marshals. Asked about cartridge boxes, the witness
                         recalled Douglas stating that in the coming fall <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName> election voters
                         should try to vote peaceably. &quot;He said &apos;if we are driven away by
                         bayonets, then we would be justified in depositing our votes, even if we
                         had to take cartridge boxes [&apos;]; he hoped it would not come to
                         that.&quot; According to Becker, Douglas stated that he would submit to
                         arrest by an eight-year-old child, provided the child had proper legal
                         papers to support it. Goddard&apos;s cross-examination focused on
                         Becker&apos;s admission that he was &quot;hard of hearing,&quot; and may
                         not have heard all that Douglas said. Becker replied: &quot;I turned the
                         good ear towards him and it might be possible that some things were said
                         which I did not hear, but he spoke slow and loud and I paid
                              attention.&quot;<hi rend="sup">49</hi></p>
                    <p>Neither the defense nor prosecution called further witnesses. Milligan then
                         made a defense speech, a handwritten version of which was submitted to the
                              tribunal.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> A skilled and experienced attorney,

                         <pb n="30" id="VAA4025-106-1-038"/> faced with a novel challenge. Stirring
                         courtroom oratory and emotional appeals to a jury, often useful in civil
                         jury trials, had no place in military commission trials. Milligan had to
                         construct a defense argument based on the facts as established by the
                         testimony of witnesses and present it to a tribunal predisposed against his
                         defendant.</p>
                    <p>Milligan first argued, citing the infamous Sedition Act of 1798, that in
                         &quot;actions for words&quot; the &quot;truth of the words&quot; can be
                         admitted as evidence. He also submitted that the existence of rumor, or
                         the widespread belief or sentiment of a community, can be admitted. He then
                         suggested the fact, known by all in the room, that two political parties
                         existed, &quot;one friendly to the Administration and the other
                         distrustful.&quot; When, he argued, all citizens adhere to the motto
                         &quot;&apos;eternal vigilance is the price of liberty,&quot;&apos; then the
                         distrustful part of the community will naturally keep a &quot;zealous
                         watchfulness&quot; over those in power. He argued that &quot;any restraint
                         of that habit is calculated to chafe and irritate the people.&quot;
                         Restrictions on free speech which the &quot;friends of the
                         Administration&quot; may find easy and reasonable &quot;might be cause of
                         greatest alarm&quot; among the distrustful group.</p>
                    <p>Milligan conceded &quot;for the sake of this argument&quot; that the utter
                         ances charged to Douglas were directed at the Lincoln administration and
                         the army, and not Republican politicians seeking to control them. However,
                         he argued, the malice of the statements -- the essential point in the
                         army&apos;s charge -- was doubtful: <quote rend="blockquote">The opinions
                              of honest men are not always matters of choice but are convictions
                              forced upon them by evidenciary [sic] circumstances...to conceal
                              those opinions is a restraint upon the freedom of thought to which
                              the American people are not yet habituated...and in this spirit was
                              the remark of the defendant made. &quot;That the Administration were
                              doing more to suppress free speech than the rebellion[&quot;] or those
                              words [&quot;] the present Administration is endeavoring to bring the
                              people under military law so as to deprive them of the right of
                              suffrage. [&quot;</quote>] Douglas, argued Milligan, believed exactly
                         that, and &quot;was unable to reconcile&quot; the administration&apos;s
                         actions with an &quot;intention...to restore the Government, or put down
                         the rebellion.&quot; Republicans had only weakened the North and
                         strengthened the South by their actions and speeches about treasonable
                         designs of the Democrats, Northern Democrats&apos; <pb n="31"
                              id="VAA4025-106-1-039"/> sympathy with the rebellion, and
                         Republicans&apos; &quot;irritating clamour&quot; about slavery. Thus, the
                         defendant &quot;justly&quot; concluded that the administration was not
                         endeavoring to restore the Union and suppress the rebellion; Douglas
                         accordingly &quot;thanked God that the widows and orphans could not look to
                         him and say he was the cause of the war.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Milligan next turned to the evidence of the witnesses and pronounced it
                         &quot;by no means satisfactory.&quot; Every point raised by the army&apos;s
                         witnesses was countered by the defense witnesses&apos; testimony, he
                         argued, and the tribunal should be cautious to credit it. The testimony of
                         Booth, the &quot;principal witness&quot; for the army&apos;s case, was
                         tainted by &quot;feelings and bias&quot; which made it unreliable. The
                         circumstances of the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2079143" reg="Crestline">Crestline</settlement></placeName> rally were next recalled. &quot;Mr.
                         Vallandigham was the advertised Speaker,&quot; and the &quot;news of his
                         arrest was fresh and exciting and it could not be expected that the
                         people would readily acquiesce in a proceeding so rare and to them full of
                         seeming danger.&quot; In such a context, that Douglas should utter
                         sentiments extemporaneously which to the commission &quot;might seem out of
                         place is not to be wondered at.&quot; Milligan argued that nothing Douglas
                         said could be considered to express sympathy for the rebellion, to be
                         disloyal, to be an attempt to discourage enlistments, or to be an
                         incitement to resist the law. Regarding the specification that he uttered
                         the words, &quot;Our once glorious Government is aiming to build up a des
                         potism,&quot; Milligan concluded with as much bombast as the venue allowed:
                              <quote rend="blockquote">I know Mr. Douglas could not have uttered
                              such a sentiment. Because he recognizes no government as ours whose
                              powers are not founded on the Constitution of the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country></placeName> the

                         and their nature is not recorded in the trial transcript. The commission
                         returned and found Douglas guilty of two of the specifications: <list

                    <p>Milligan had succeeded in drawing the distinction between criticism of
                         military arrests -- Burnside&apos;s favored means to quell resistance --
                         and speech decrying mere &quot;illegal arrests.&quot; But Douglas had been
                         found guilty of uttering words considered an incitement to violent
                         resistance to authority. The commission judged Douglas to have spoken
                         inflammatory language -- his call to carry arms to the polls -- in clear
                         violation of General Orders Number 38. Douglas&apos;s violent language,
                         according to the judges, had been stronger than Vallandigham&apos;s, which
                         had criticized Burnside&apos;s order and had merely encouraged voters to
                         expel the tyrant &quot;King Lincoln.&quot;<hi rend="sup">52</hi> Although
                         the officers on the commission found Douglas guilty of a serious violation
                         of Burnside&apos;s order, they returned a verdict of &quot;not guilty&quot;
                         to the overall charge and dismissed the case. With the weight of
                         Lincoln&apos;s displeasure pressing on Burnside, it is likely that the
                         general instructed the tribunal to reach the &quot;not guilty&quot;
                         verdict.</p>
                    <p>Even more surprising than its verdict, with the end of the Douglas trial the
                         military commission adjourned <hi rend="i">sine die</hi>, never to
                         reconvene. The tribunal empanelled to try cases of violations of General
                         Orders Number 38, which had famously convicted Vallandigham, was no more.

                         of his military captors. He tore into the Republicans and blamed Union
                         League treachery for his arrest. The assembly passed resolutions condemning
                         the arrests of Douglas and Engelbert Zimmerman, the editor of the
                         Democratic <hi rend="i">Columbia City News</hi>, whom General Hascall had
                         arrested and whose newspaper he suppressed for a short period in May. The

                         martyrs for free speech. In the days and weeks to come, Douglas spoke at

                    <p>Douglas&apos;s run-ins with military authority did not end there. His new
                         status as a Democratic party hero and leader meant that he was recognized
                         by Republicans as one of the &quot;Copperhead ringleaders&quot; in the
                         region. In early July, newspapers reported that a &quot;mob&quot; in
                         <placeName><region type="county" key="tgn_1003022" reg="Whitley">Whitley County</region></placeName> had rescued deserters who had been arrested by the county

                         and raised cheers for President Lincoln and Generals Meade and Grant. A man
                         in the crowd of onlookers cried out &quot;Three cheers for
                         Vallandigham!&quot; and ran. Several people in the crowd took up the cheer.
                         Soldiers angrily gave chase in the direction of the original voice. In the
                         ensuing melee, Douglas, standing in the crowd, panicked and &quot;also
                         broke and ran&quot; in the same direction. Confusing Douglas for the man
                         who yelled for Vallandigham, the soldiers seized him and forced him into
                         one of their wagons. Douglas&apos;s brother-in-law Eli W. Brown (Democratic
                         county surveyor at the time) of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031435" reg="Columbia City">Columbia City</settlement></placeName> tried to interpose, but one
                         of the soldiers shot at him four times, fortunately merely grazing him. The
                         troops also seized Brown and hoisted him into the wagon. Both were
                         threatened with death should they resist. The soldiers soon released both
                         men when it became clear that Douglas had not cheered for Vallandigham. The
                         troops arrested the cheerer and hauled him away to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2032431" reg="Kendallville">Kendallville</settlement></placeName>.<hi

                    <p>A study of the events surrounding Alexander J. Douglas&apos;s arrest, trial,
                         and release reveals several important issues. First, the episode highlights
                         the impact the arrest of a political figure of merely local standing had
                         on national policy. Historians who focus only on the arrests of national
                         political figures like Clement Vallandigham during the Civil War overlook
                         events of great significance. Democrats reacted to the news of the arrest
                         of their local political leaders -- their neighbors, people they knew or
                         had met -- not just to the news of national figures whom they knew only in
                         the abstract. Douglas was a significant political figure in his corner of

                         military officers deemed him &quot;of sufficient importance&quot; to

                                   Republican newspaper reported that soldiers found Douglas hiding

                                   coward.&quot; This was probably the editor&apos;s payback for
                                   Douglas calling him a &quot;pusillanimous coward and a liar&quot;

                         result of his arrest. A show of military force was deemed necessary to

                         defiance of Republican and military authority. Douglas&apos;s arrest and
                         subsequent release energized the Democrats in his corner of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> exactly
                         as Morton had dreaded, an event replicated in almost every locale where
                         similar military heavy-handedness occurred. More importantly, the
                         repercussions of the arrest of this relatively minor political figure took
                         place on the state and national levels. Burnside&apos;s arrest of Douglas,
                         coupled with military arrests of newspaper editors, prompted Indiana&apos;s
                         governor to intervene with the president and his cabinet. This entire
                         sequence of events suggests that historians should burrow more deeply in
                         the archives to understand better the ramifications of purportedly
                         insignificant and merely incidental arrests.</p>
                    <p>Knowledge of the Douglas arrest and trial also overturns our understanding of
                         the end of Burnside&apos;s intervention into political affairs in the
                         District of the Ohio to override civil government. Governor Morton&apos;s
                         lobbying in Washington had forced a president-who had not paid sufficient
                         attention to political affairs in the Midwest or to the actions of his
                         military commander there -- to rein in Burnside. Though the general wanted
                         to impose even more rigorous measures to silence criticism of the
                         administration, he had no choice but to disband the military tribunal. In
                         an attempt to retain as much of his get-tough policy as possible, Burnside
                         held onto General Orders Number 38, but he no longer enforced it with
                         arrests such as those of Vallandigham or Douglas, and no more military
                         commission trials for violations of the order occurred. It is notable that
                         when Burnside ordered the suppression of the <hi rend="i">Chicago

                    <p>Second, it is critically important to reassess the dynamics between the
                         Northern state governments and the federal government during the Civil War.
                         The understanding of the relationship between the Northern governors and
                         President Lincoln has been dominated by William Hesseltine&apos;s
                         characterization of the state governors as weak, ineffectual, and dangerous
                         to the Union&apos;s survival. In his effort to promote Lincoln as the
                         nation&apos;s preserver, Hesseltine denigrated the governors. Morton,
                         though perhaps the most effective of the Northern governors during the
                         rebellion, received special derision at the historian&apos;s hands.
                         Hesseltine&apos;s thesis has had widespread and lasting influence on
                         generations of historians, who have seldom examined the complex
                         interrelationships between state and federal governments.<hi rend="sup"
                              >57</hi> The Douglas arrest episode, along with Morton&apos;s
                         simultaneous effort to stop Hascall&apos;s policy of stifling Democratic
                         newspaper speech in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, should prompt a reassessment. Through this
                         episode we see a president -- preoccupied with the war effort in the East
                         and the failures of the Army of the Potomac -- passively inattentive to the
                         deterioration of political conditions in the Midwestern states. Assigning
                         Burnside to the Department of the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName> shows that Lincoln neither
                         understood the conditions on the ground nor had a plan to quell resistance
                         in the region. Lincoln, carried along by the tide of events, failed to
                         oversee his general in a region where disaffection and resistance to the
                         federal government were becoming increasingly dangerous. Morton played a
                         leading role in national affairs -- his pressure on Lincoln and the cabinet
                         ended military trials of civilians under General Orders Number 38, one of
                         the most egregious instances of military interference in domestic political

                    </placeName> can be gauged by Burnside&apos;s
                         increasing hostility to him. The general blamed the governor for halting
                         his policy of rigorous military intervention in political matters. Since
                         Burnside had taken command of the Department of the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName> in March, Morton
                         had fought him in multiple disputes over personnel issues, troop levels in
                         <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, and military expeditions to quell disturbances in the state. The
                         governor, according to the general, meddled with strictly military matters.
                         While Burnside had succeeded in keeping the governor from dictating to him
                         on military administration, the governor won the upper hand when the
                         general tried to impose military solutions on political problems.
                         Morton&apos;s success in removing Hascall and ending military commission
                         trials so angered one of Burnside&apos;s staff officers that he turned the
                         governor&apos;s portrait hanging in army headquarters upside down. Burnside
                         continued to believe that civil authorities possessed neither the power
                         nor the will to put down resistance to the draft enrollments in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>.
                         &quot;The civil law is too slow,&quot; he complained privately. Neighboring
                         governors acceded to Burnside&apos;s requests to declare martial law in
                         their states, but Morton resisted military authority and prevailed.
                         Burnside&apos;s claim to be &quot;Governor over five&quot; states failed to
                         take the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> governor into account.<hi rend="sup">59</hi></p>

                         was perhaps the high point of his political career, and proved to be his
                         most powerful effort against the Lincoln administration. Democratic <list

                         he once was an also-ran politician, he now was a popular party hero and

                         role in anti-war Democratic politics in his home county and all over
                         northern <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>. However, shortly after his military commission success,
                         Milligan turned from legal means and embraced extra-legal violence as a
                         method for political change. Emboldened by his new popularity, later in
                         1863 he joined the secret society known as the Organization of American
                         Knights, previously known as the Knights of the Golden Circle. The
                         organization changed its name in early 1864 to the Sons of Liberty.
                         Thousands of members all over Indiana and neighboring states organized to
                         protect deserters and to oppose the draft by force. The group secretly
                         perfected plans to raise rebellion in the region, seize federal arsenals,
                         release and arm rebel prisoners of war, and seize power as a diversionary
                         measure to aid the Confederate cause. Milligan became the Sons of
                         Liberty&apos;s military leader for the northeastern quarter of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>. He
                         viewed his popularity and influence sufficient to make a bid for governor
                         based on the strength of the antiwar wing of the Democratic Party, but the
                         party rejected his nomination at the state convention. That summer the
                         Sons of Liberty planned an uprising in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>. Tipped off to the plans,
                         troops raided fellow leader Harrison H. Dodd&apos;s <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName> printing
                         warehouse and discovered boxes full of guns and ammunition, as well as
                         organizational records. In early October, a company of troops surrounded
                         Milligan&apos;s <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2032243" reg="Huntington">Huntington</settlement></placeName> house and arrested him for his role as a leader
                         of the secret plot to seize arms and free rebel prisoners. He stood trial
                         by military commission in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName> for treason. It is a significant
                         irony that Governor Morton, who a year before was an adamant opponent of
                         the use of military commissions for trials of civilians, was now a leading
                         force behind their use to batter his Democratic opponents in the election
                         year of 1864. The military commission found Milligan guilty and sentenced
                         him to death, but his sentence was commuted to life in prison, and in 1866,
                         President Andrew Johnson pardoned him. While Milligan was imprisoned, a
                         suit made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in 1866 that
                         military trials of civilians shall not occur where martial law is not in
                         place and the civil courts are open. <hi rend="i">Ex parte Milligan</hi> is

                              was a member of the secret organization: &quot;We claim the right to
                              show that the purpose Mr. Milligan had in view in going into the order
                              was to control and direct it so that it should do no mischief.&quot;

                    <p>Hull House, for over a century regarded as a venerable <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName> institution,
                         has more recently come under a growing amount of critical scrutiny, as has
                         its often-lionized founder, Jane Addams. Hull House&apos;s relationship
                         with <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>&apos;s Jewish community has become a source of particular
                         interest, especially in its comparison with Addams&apos;s relations to
                         other local immigrant communities. One scholar has argued that while Hull
                         House&apos;s cooperation with the Jewish labor movement is justly famous,
                         it &quot;should be seen more in the context of Hull House&apos;s indus
                         trial relations policies than as an expression of its relations with the
                         Jewish community as such.&quot;<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Yet given that most of

                         incorporation, the first Jewish resident in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName> was Morris Baumgarten,
                         who was believed to have arrived in 1832, with the peddler J. Gottleib
                         following two years later. Other Jewish settlers, almost entirely of

                         non-Jewish counterparts, they had the significant advantages of literacy
                         and of occupation, the latter usually as middlemen and peddlers.
                         Moreover, they were comfortable around Gentiles to a degree that would

                    <p>Unlike the German &quot;Second Wave&quot; of Jewish immigrants who gravitated
                         to small towns as well as major cities, the &quot;Third Wave&quot; by and

                         vast majority of this new group of Jewish immigrants arrived with little
                         education or worldly wealth, and seemed comparatively inassimilable to
                         Protestant America and to their coreligionists alike. While this group
                         included a smattering of small-time merchants, such as rag dealers and
                         craftsmen of various kinds, the vast majority were involved in clothes

                         was assuredly a preferable alternative to employment in the mines and

                         lodges, businesses, and institutions. As a result of the fire, however,
                         given limited resources and inordinately great need, major tensions arose
                         for the first time regarding how much the by-then established German Jewish
                         community should assist the more recent arrivals from <placeName><country key="tgn_7002435" reg="Russija">Russia</country></placeName> and Eastern

                         <p>These unhealthy dwellings served not only as living spaces for large
                              numbers of immigrants, but also frequently as workspaces for a number
                              of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>&apos;s industries, most infamously the clothing industry.
                              And as <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>&apos;s clothing industry grew from the 1860s onward,
                              the number of sweatshops increased exponentially. Early efforts to
                              organize the garment trades unions met with limited success. The
                              structure of the industry, which centered on putting out piecework to
                              a frequently untraceable warren of sweatshops, was only the beginning
                              of the fledgling garment trades movement&apos;s difficulties, that
                              also included the ethnic diversity of the workforce and
                              employers&apos; willingness to exploit inter-group prejudices.<hi
                                   rend="sup">13</hi> Although these sweatshop conditions at first
                              applied fairly equally to all sectors of the clothing industries,
                              notable advances were to take place within the men&apos;s clothing
                              trades. By the 1890s, there was an increased demand for &quot;quality
                              tailoring,&quot; which facilitated the increased move of men&apos;s
                              clothing manufacturing to the factories, or &quot;inside
                                   shops.&quot;<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Even among &quot;inside shops,
                              however,&quot; some clothing firms emerged as &quot;better than,&quot;
                              and the one regarded as the best by any measure was Hart, Schaffner,
                              and Marx, which by 1905 had bought out the sweatshops to which it had
                              been contracting out businesses, unprecedentedly moving all operations
                              under its supervision.<hi rend="sup">15</hi></p>
                         <p>Despite its much-lauded reputation for progressiveness, HSM made no
                              pretense of workplace democracy. Foremen (and &quot;foreladies&quot;
                              for that matter) could be arbitrary and abusive, and the purpose of
                              day-to-day management was, for all accounts, to keep worker earnings
                              as low as possible. As Rebecca August, who began working at HSM around
                              1905 recalled, &quot;the Head man used to see to it that workers
                              didn&apos;t make too much money,&quot; adding &quot;when he thot [sic]
                              the fastest worker made $20 or more, all the others had to have their
                              price cut.&quot; What made working at HSM more bearable, and even
                              comparatively desirable, was that it was otherwise vastly superior in
                              terms of wages, hours, and work- <list type="footnotes">

                              time when most clothing houses were going in the opposite direction,
                              moving work to &quot;outside&quot; shops at the same time that
                              immigrants were increasingly replacing native-born workers in the
                              workforce. Although German Jewish business owners were apparently
                              responsive to the prophetic call of Reform Judaism and Ethical Culture
                              before 1910, this translated mainly into charitable giving on behalf
                              of the Eastern European Jewish workers who could not support their
                              families on what they were paid. Also, rather than looking critically
                              at themselves, most chose to feel comfortably superior to the Eastern
                              European Jewish sweatshop bosses, many of whom were genuinely more
                              exploitative in how they treated those below them.<hi rend="sup"

                              became known as the Panic of 1893. It came hard on the heels of the
                              World&apos;s Columbian Exposition, a time when <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName> was showing its
                              best face to the world. The Panic hit <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName> hard, leaving massive
                              unemployment, with twenty percent of the workforce laid off during the
                              winter of 1892-93 alone, and more than ten percent of the city&apos;s
                              population threatened with starvation. The 1893 Panic also triggered
                              a new upsurge of labor unrest that reached another peak with the
                              Pullman Strike of 1894, an event magnified by the willingness of the
                              press to stir up public fears of a life-and-death struggle between
                              labor and capital, making its eventual defeat another serious trial

                              Addams and her resident colleagues including Florence Kelley, Grace
                              and Edith Abbott, and Ellen Gates Starr, also served as a
                              clearinghouse for a variety of immigrant needs and concerns, and
                              therefore grew from being a friendly gathering place for immigrant
                              neighbors to a formidable force for change in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>, and ultimately

                              of genuine cultural sensitivity. Indeed, one recent scholar has
                              concluded that Addams had the least success working with Eastern
                              European Jewish immigrants, especially when it came to the matter of
                              affirming ethnic identity.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Even so, there is

                              immigrants benefited from Hull House&apos;s services, especially
                              before there was a Jewish-run settlement or communal center of any
                              kind to provide significant competition. For example, the
                              autobiography of Hilda Satt Polacheck, a Russian Jewish immigrant to
                              <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>, focused on how Addams changed the course of her life.
                              Polacheck -- at the time a clothing worker -- had, after one long day
                              on the job, walked over to Hull House, where Addams talked to her and
                              decided that she should try hand spinning for the settlement&apos;s
                              Labor Museum, a handicrafts workshop for immigrant youth. Polacheck
                              responded well to the craft, and went on to become an active member of
                              the Hull House community, eventually obtaining a college education
                              with Addams&apos;s encouragement.<hi rend="sup">22</hi></p>
                         <p>Over time, however, Polacheck&apos;s story became less and less typical,
                              as Hull House received increased competition from German Jewish
                              organizations such as the Maxwell Street Settlement and, more signifi
                              cantly, the Chicago Hebrew Institute. While Addams has been rightly
                              lauded for her role in transforming the lives of all the working-class
                              immigrant communities through her active support of the garment trades
                              and other union movements, her overall legacy in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>&apos;s Jewish
                              community is more mixed, owing largely to the tension within that
                              community between Germans and Eastern Europeans, and between longtime
                              and newly arrived immigrants. This tension, in turn, highlighted the
                              difficulties of reconciling Addams&apos;s stated objective of
                              Americanization with her growing appreciation of the necessity of
                              maintaining the best of immigrant cultures. In some ways Addams and
                              her Hull House colleagues were thoroughly in league with the German
                              Jewish ideal of Americanization: that Jewish identity should be main
                              tained but should also be adapted as much as possible to American
                              ways. As part of their opposition to bilingual education, they
                              supported the efforts of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>&apos;s German Jews to eliminate the

                              pupils would &quot;&apos;defer the hopes of American citizenship by

                              communal identity. Throughout her career at the helm of Hull House,
                              Addams made no provisions for the importance of Yiddish language and
                              culture as an existing source of identity for the city&apos;s Eastern
                              European Jews. By the same token, the Eastern European Jewish
                              community already had its own Americanizing agent in the German Jewish
                              community: &quot;[T]he Jewish leadership as a whole,&quot; writes
                              Lissak, &quot;was reluctant to give Hull House any foothold in the

                              Hull House&apos;s first residents, had begun her illustrious career as
                              the state&apos;s first factory inspector in 1894, becoming an early

                         <p>One of Hull House&apos;s most notable contributions to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>&apos;s
                              immigrant working class was its willingness to provide a space for
                              labor organizations to meet. This was no small thing, especially for
                              women workers and organizers: the job of mounting any successful labor
                              action required a more comfortable and acceptable alternative to the
                              saloons that were the only available meeting spaces at the time.
                              Before this was possible, however, Hull House had to earn credibility
                              with <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>&apos;s labor activists. It did so in 1891, when Addams
                              invited Mary Kenney, president of the women&apos;s bookbinders&apos;
                              union and one of the city&apos;s first female union leaders, to Hull
                              House for dinner. Kenney initially suspected Addams of being simply
                              another upper-class philanthropist, but Addams proved able to win her
                              over, and the resulting partnership gave Hull House the necessary

                         <p>The Great Strike of 1910 grew out of many causes, some of them pervasive
                              across the industry and others unique to the strike&apos;s originat
                              ing location: Hart, Schaffner, and Marx. Of the clothing
                              industry&apos;s 38,000 workers, 65 percent were immigrants and 32
                              percent had immigrant parents. Eastern European Jews, who would end
                              up playing such a large role in the industry&apos;s union leadership,
                              were not the largest ethnic group represented in the workforce,
                              although they constituted a sizeable minority. About half the
                              workforce was female, and while women workers played a significant
                              role in the strike, only Bessie Abramowitz would play a significant
                              leadership role.<hi rend="sup">29</hi></p>
                         <p>For all the problems with HSM&apos;s work environment, Hannah (Annie)
                              Shapiro, one of the instigators of the strike, remembered conditions
                              there as relatively good compared to other places she had worked. The
                              company allowed her to leave early Friday and to stay home on
                              Saturday. But Shapiro, a natural leader, apparently saw enough
                              problems in the workplace that she began speaking to the bosses about
                              the grievances of her co-workers, as well as reporting her own. It
                              was not surprising, therefore, that on September 22, 1910, when she
                              decided that a piece-rate reduction for pocket-sewing from four cents
                              to three-and-a-half cents was unacceptable, she not only walked out,
                              but persuaded sixteen other women to join her. This spontaneous
                              walkout grew into a mass strike that included thousands of workers
                              from several shops across the city. Strike leader and later
                              Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) official Frank

                         <p>At first, however, the action seemed just another instance of what had
                              become typical wildcat strikes among the Jewish clothing workers. To
                              date, such walkouts had greatly outpaced workers&apos; efforts at
                              coordinating an organized strike. Yet as Jacob Potofsky, a future
                              leader of the ACWA, recalled, word of the initial walkout spread via a
                              Hull House meeting; five hundred people gathered to air their
                              grievances, after which Potofsky returned to his shop floor in an
                              effort to convince some three hundred fellow workers to join him in
                              the growing walkout. The meeting, which also served as an
                              after-the-fact planning and coordination session, resulted in the
                              formation of several committees staffed by the strikers&apos;
                              Progressive allies. The Pickets Committee, according to early labor
                              historian Leo Wolman, not only supported the pickets, but also gave
                              essential &quot;publicity to the outrageous conduct of the police and
                              strikebreakers&quot; -- an act that helped &quot;as much as anything
                              during the first few weeks towards swinging the weight of public
                              opinion on the side of the strikers.&quot; Addams would later recall
                              that it was &quot;a matter of pride to the residents of Hull-House
                              that the first meeting&quot; leading to the founding of the ACWA
                              &quot;should have been held in one of our rooms, offered as a refuge
                              to a number of Russian Jewish men and women who had split off from a
                              Trades Union meeting on the North Side of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>. &quot;<hi

                              delighting in the pleasures of a strike, which is...a relaxation

                              emphasize the pathos of the strikers&apos; situation, including, in
                              one article, an appeal to her readers&apos; sympathy for &quot;a

                              broken English &quot;&apos;I cannot speak out in words all those

                         <p>The strike resulting from the &quot;mistreatings&quot; recounted by this
                              anonymous worker lasted for five months before the national leadership
                              of the United Garment Workers (UGW), the only men&apos;s clothing
                              union at the time, stepped in to broker a premature settlement. During
                              those months, strikers waged a pitched struggle in the face of
                              obstacles ranging from police violence to inadequate funding,
                              especially as supplies of food and coal fell short. As a result,
                              widespread public support and recognition of the essential justice of
                              the striker&apos;s grievances helped to keep the strike going as long
                              as it did. Violence against the strikers, present from the
                              strike&apos;s beginning, only increased with the manufacturer&apos;s
                              importation of out-of-town strikebreakers. The strikebreakers&apos;
                              presence would become an increasingly complicating factor, as the
                              efforts of hired guards to &quot;protect&quot; them led to further

                              blamed for the violence. The magnitude of the violence became
                              especially apparent when two strikers, Charles Lazinskas and Frank
                              Nagrekis, were killed by the police -- Lazinskas after he had
                              purportedly attacked a &quot;special policeman&quot; hired by the
                              Royal Tailors.<hi rend="sup">35</hi></p>

                         <p>Women workers were not spared in the police brutality, and even their
                              upper-class female supporters, notably Starr, were roughed up by the
                              police. Starr vividly recounted one of her run-ins with <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName> police
                              as she sought to assist strikers and to influence a large group of
                              apparent strikebreakers in front of the Price &amp; Co. clothing
                              factory. The strikebreakers had been given police protection, Starr
                              reported, against &quot;a group of three rather small women&quot; that
                              included Emma Steghagen and &quot;Miss S. M. Franklin&quot; as well as
                              herself -- all of whom, she added, were &quot;never allowed to stand
                              for an instant, but [were] ordered, usually roughly to &apos;move
                              about their business.&quot;&apos; In a characteristic example of her
                              combative assertiveness, Starr proceeded to argue with the police
                              officers. She then recounted: <quote rend="blockquote">After a time, a
                                   superior officer arrived who was insolent and brutal and
                                   absolutely outside his rights, as I was entirely within mine. I
                                   was then alone, having separated myself from the girls, and was
                                   simply walking back and forth in front of the factory. After
                                   roughly asking me, &apos;who are you?&apos; and &apos;What are
                                   you doing here&apos; and hearing that I was simply a citizen of
                                   the United States and settlement worker here in the interest of
                                   justice and fair play, he informed me that if I passed by once
                                   more I would be sent to the station.</quote> Starr retreated, but
                              the police continued to take every measure possible to
                              &quot;protect&quot; the strikebreakers, ensuring that &quot;no pickets
                              should be allowed to speak to them.&quot; Starr called the spectacle
                              &quot;a heart sickening sight&quot; to a proud descendant of Ethan
                              Allen and &quot;an American since 1632.&quot;<hi rend="sup">36</hi> If

                         <p>With winter approaching and neither side apparently willing to give,
                              pressure to settle the strike came from a growing number of outside
                              groups, including a &quot;Citizens&apos; Committee&quot; that would
                              work closely with the WTUL, arguing that, according to Maureen
                              Flanagan, &quot;a just solution to the strike was not only important
                              for the striking employees,&quot; but even more importantly &quot;for
                              the welfare of the city.&quot;<hi rend="sup">38</hi> The committee
                              appointed Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch as its head. In this role, Hirsch would
                              reveal the tension that, for many Progressives, lay between their
                              lofty ideals and a more visceral disdain for some of the same people
                              whom they sought to uplift. Hirsch, during his long and illustrious
                              career as rabbi of the prestigious Sinai Temple, frequently served as
                              the <hi rend="i">de facto</hi> conscience of the city&apos;s German
                              Jewish community; his writings and sermons often &quot;touched on
                              the special duties that capitalists and men of wealth owed to
                                   society.&quot;<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Hirsch played an essentially
                              prophetic role in relation to the German Jewish community&apos;s
                              response to the strike. As rabbi, he commanded the attention of a
                              number of leading clothing manufacturers who belonged to Sinai Temple,
                              and his reach also extended further, through both his public writing
                              and his chairing of the Citizens&apos; Committee (the German Jewish
                              members of which were, according to Steven Fraser, ashamed enough of
                              their coreligionists to declare the strike &quot;thoroughly
                              justified&quot;). Yet Hirsch may have maintained his credibility
                              with the clothing manufacturers because his attitude towards the
                              Eastern European Jewish community scarcely differed from theirs. Like
                              them, he felt a genuine sense of responsibility towards and concern
                              for his coreligionists, mixed with a healthy dose of paternalism and
                              sometimes barely disguised contempt.<hi rend="sup">40</hi></p>

                         <p>Hirsch revealed this ambivalence in his public declaration that the
                              walkout was likely &quot;a manifestation of &apos;Jewish
                              emotionalism,&quot;&apos; arguing that &quot;if there is a basis for
                              the strike, the committee will endeavor to adjust it,&quot; but that
                              if it were &quot;merely an attempt on the part of a few to organize
                              the workers I would not consider the cause to be an altogether worthy
                              one.&quot; Hirsch then surmised that &quot;the strike is an emotional
                              affair, such as Jewish people, especially Jewish women are easy prey
                              to.&quot; Yet, perhaps anticipating or responding to the protestations
                              of non-Jewish elite women such as Starr, he also remarked that
                              &quot;&apos;If one talks about the wrongs of the Jewish race and
                              appeals to them on the strength of this argument, the wrong they
                              suffer now, either real or imaginary -- it is not difficult in this
                              way to arouse the sympathy of Jewish people as well as others,&quot;
                              but that it would be &quot;our larger purpose to bring all of these
                              factions together on a common basis and try to reestablish peace as
                              quickly as possible.&quot;<hi rend="sup">41</hi></p>
                         <p>Several Hull House residents, but none more so than Starr, involved
                              themselves in nearly all phases of strike support, joining the WTUL
                              and other upper-class activist groups. In order to reach the middle
                              class and because of the background of the most prominent activists,
                              they emphasized the then-normative themes of the sanctity of mother
                              hood, childhood, and the home, and the threats to all of these by an
                              industrial system that kept women toiling in the sweatshops. They may
                              also have been trying to highlight the very real needs of the 5,000
                              infant children of unemployed strikers, including the 1,250
                              &quot;strike babies&quot; born during this time. One committee member
                              likened the starvation of the babies and small children to the
                              Biblical &quot;slaughter of the innocents,&quot; while Addams,
                              arguing that the children &quot;have done nothing wrong whether their

                              towards the strikers, and when the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> announced
                              a benefit concert sponsored by the Garment Strikers&apos; Aid Society,
                              it did not fail to note that &quot;a Northwest Side physician promised
                              to donate double the amount of the intake of this concert,&quot; or to

                         <p>Ellen Gates Starr would eventually emerge as a self-appointed prophet.
                              She admonished German Jewish clothing manufacturers using references
                              both to the Bible and to the history of Jewish oppression, and earned
                              an unusual degree of praise from the strikers who were, as Addams put
                              it, &quot;always rather sensitive in regard to the assistance of out
                              siders.&quot; Yet Starr&apos;s activism differed from her colleagues
                              less in kind than in degree. Other Hull House residents and <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>
                              Progressives, working individually and collectively, offered

                                   themselves in a desperate conflict against formidable odds. Grace
                                   Abbott, then a resident of Hull House, together with Jane Addams
                                   and other prominent women, joined the fight. She joined our
                                   picket line, helped to collect funds for food and shelter, spoke
                                   at our meetings, presented our case to the public, and appealed
                                   to the city administration to arbitrate the strike.<hi rend="sup"
                                        >47</hi></quote> Addams began her support rather
                              conservatively, focusing on relief for needy strikers, but eventually
                              developed a close partnership with Hillman, who by then shared with
                              her both the belief that &quot;industrial warfare&quot; was a cause of
                              great waste, and a conviction of the necessity of seeking other ways
                              to work out labor-management disputes. This partnership, balanced
                              with Addams&apos;s close ties to the HSM management, gave her vital
                              credibility as an intermediary between the workers and the management
                              at HSM. According to Daniel Levine, one of her earlier biographers, it
                              was Addams who persuaded HSM&apos;s chief negotiator Earl Dean Howard,
                              and through him Joseph Schaffner, that this &quot;was no ordinary
                              strike, but a spontaneous, leaderless revolution based on long
                              standing hatreds and injustices.&quot; This strong statement, which
                              became part of Howard&apos;s report, moved Schaffner to offer his
                              workers a settlement that was more generous than both his own
                              previous offers and those of other clothing houses. Even so, it took
                              Hillman&apos;s persuasion for the HSM workers to accept it in the face
                              of opposition fomented by members of the International Workers of the

                              leaders found themselves at odds with their erstwhile allies on this
                              issue.</p>
                         <p>A poignant example was Julius Rosenwald, who served on the board of the
                              Immigrants&apos; Protective League alongside Grace Abbott and her
                              sister Edith, also a noted Progressive reformer. Although Rosenwald
                              (unlike Joseph Schaffner) always remained officially at odds with the
                              Jewish labor movement and always insisted on a firm separation between
                              business and charity, the philanthropy for which he became nationally
                              famous was justly recognized by the Progressive activists with whom he
                              regularly interacted. Additionally, over time, he had reason to be
                              proud of the working conditions and environment he created at the helm
                              of Sears, Roebuck and Company. Rosenwald could undoubtedly have ended
                              up as simply one of the richer philanthropists in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>, who urged
                              others to give generously. But the level to which he took his

                              leader of his own community, Rabbi Hirsch. As a result, Rosenwald
                              often found himself forced to tread a thin line between supporting the
                              efforts of the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName> Progressives, including the Immigrants&apos;

                              about trade-unions, and we all felt very sorry during the garment

                              situation was made additionally uncomfortable, Abbott wrote, because
                              &quot;some of the girls who came to the meetings at Hull House were
                              from the shops of Mr. Rosenwald&apos;s company.&quot; Rosenwald
                              undoubtedly suffered additional embarrassment when the Tribune
                              reported that &quot;nearly 100 girls at the Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.
                              plant joined the strike,&quot; walking out, ironically, &quot;because
                              of a rule against &apos;piece work,&apos; a system under which they
                              earned as much as $18 a week, and the announcement of a salary of
                              figure of $12.&quot; During one unusually long-running board meeting
                              of the Immigrants&apos; Protective League that took place during the
                              strike, Abbott wrote, sister Grace extricated herself in order to go
                              and make a speech in support of the strikers. As she headed out into

                         <p>By early December, the strikers had won enough public sympathy to
                              convince Hart, Schaffner, and Marx to negotiate. The company had
                              agreed to two &quot;peace propositions,&quot; both of which were
                              rejected, one by the workers for its punitive nature, the other by the
                              Manufacturers&apos; Association, which truculently declared that there
                              was &quot;nothing to arbitrate.&quot; The agreement that the
                              clothing workers finally managed to negotiate with the comparatively
                              forward-looking HSM did not include union recognition.<hi rend="sup"
                                   >51</hi> Not surprisingly, many rank-and-file strikers found its
                              terms unacceptable, and voted accordingly. A vocal minority, consist
                              ing mostly of non-Jewish workers, was especially eager to denounce not
                              only the settlement, but also the strike leaders, who had allowed the
                              agreement. Only by force of Hillman&apos;s persuasion was the majority
                              able to prevail on dissenters to ratify the HSM agreement as an
                              important first step. There was no avoiding the fact, however, that it
                              was a very small step, for it only ended the strike at HSM. As the
                              winter wore on and spirits flagged, Thomas Rickert, the president of
                              the UGW, used his office to unilaterally end the strike, behind the
                              backs of the strikers, their leaders, and the Conference Board.<hi

                         <p>Why, given its inconclusive ending, did this particular walkout create
                              a movement that lasted well beyond the strike, when nearly all its
                              predecessors had petered out? One key factor was that it involved a
                              company that was comparatively progressive in its outlook, a firm that
                              -- while rejecting a closed shop -- recognized the potential advan

                              Commission on Industrial Relations, which had been investigating
                              conditions in the industry, he fully acknowledged the general
                              discontent prior to the strike: <quote rend="blockquote">Careful study
                                   of the situation has led me to the belief that the fundamental
                                   cause of the strike was that the workers had no satisfactory
                                   channel through which minor grievances, exactions, and petty
                                   tyrannies of underbosses could be taken up and amicably
                                   adjusted....The result was there steadily grew up in the minds of
                                   many of feeling of distrust and enmity towards their immediate
                                   superiors...because they felt that justice was being denied them.
                                   If they had the temerity to complain against a boss, they
                                   incurred his displeasure, and his word was taken in preference
                                   to theirs. In some instances they lost their jobs, and where this
                                   was not the case they seldom received any satisfaction.</quote>

                              admitting that just days prior to the strike he &quot;was so badly
                              informed of the conditions&quot; that he &quot;called the attention of
                              a friend to the satisfactory state of the employees.&quot; On
                              learning the truth about the conditions in his own factories, he
                              testified, he had concluded that if anything, &quot;the strike should
                              have occurred much sooner.&quot;<hi rend="sup">54</hi> This belated

                              beginnings in October 1914, the &quot;new United Garment Workers&quot;
                              union faced a variety of problems, including a lawsuit over its name
                              that tied up both finances and attention. When the legal wrangling was
                              finally settled, Rickert&apos;s UGW maintained control of the rights
                              to the name and to the organization&apos;s treasury and <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7007567" reg="New York">New York</settlement></placeName>

                              new organization did manage to maintain the property of the UGW&apos;s

                              a release from all other legal claims in exchange for agreeing to

                              that they had simply thrown the letters in the trash. Significantly,
                              the workers were calling for and publicizing their willingness to
                              embrace the arbitration process that had proven so successful at HSM,
                              while the manufacturers remained staunchly unwilling to negotiate. The
                              attorney representing the Wholesale Clothing Manufacturers&apos;

                              on strike, save for the agitation of union leaders. Hillman spent

                         <p>The strike officially began on September 27, 1915, at the pre-arranged
                              signals of the shop chairmen. Despite Hillman&apos;s strict orders
                              prohibiting violence on the part of the strikers, the Chicago Daily
                              Tribune reported 493 acts of violence, including what Wyatt described
                              as &quot;the most cowardly and brutal attacks on
                              strike-breakers, -- three persons against one, the beating of girls,
                              the throwing of acid.&quot; Displaying a balance apparently absent
                              from the <hi rend="1">Tribune</hi> report, Wyatt also pointed out that
                              &quot;the report mentioned no violences as perpetrated against strik-
                              ers&quot; despite the fact that &quot;many of the names and addresses
                              on the list of sufferers from violence were known to be those of
                                   strikers.&quot;<hi rend="sup">59</hi></p>
                         <p>The level of police brutality in 1915 exceeded even that of the 1910
                              strike. Officers drove motorcycles into crowds of strikers -- prompting
                              comparisons with the police in Russia -- and arrested and jailed nearly
                              two thousand people by the time the strike was concluded. Mayor
                              William Hale &quot;Big Bill&quot; Thompson steadfastly refused to rein
                              in the excesses of the force. The situation reached a new low on
                              October 27, 1915, when officers suddenly charged a crowd assembled
                              near the union&apos;s headquarters -- and near one of the factories
                              located at the corner of Harrison and Halsted Streets. A deaf tailor,
                              Samuel Kapper, failed to get away fast enough, and was shot in cold
                              blood, despite later police claims of having fired in self-defense.
                              Ten thousand men, women, and children marched in Kapper&apos;s funeral
                              procession, and the sight of these crowds further influenced public
                                   opinion.<hi rend="sup">60</hi></p>
                         <p>On November 10, an estimated 1,000 strikers and supporters marched
                              together to city hall for court appearances, only to be released on
                              their own recognizance when the crowd proved too large for the
                              courtroom. Although Mayor Thompson himself remained largely unre
                              sponsive to the complaints of the strikers and their supporters, their
                              efforts did eventually lead to an investigation of the police that led
                              in turn to lasting reform. Starr, writing in her unpublished

                              summer&apos;s streetcar strike, Starr added that the mayor
                              &quot;turned a deaf ear to all approaches of well-known individuals,
                              representatives of labor, of women&apos;s social and political

                         <p>Yet Starr and her settlement colleagues persisted in their highly public
                              support of the strike, doing everything from walking the picket line
                              to providing food and clothing to strikers&apos; families who were in
                              need. Union leader Potofsky wrote of Starr&apos;s tireless efforts
                              that &quot;I recall her visits to my office at 818 Harrison Street
                              with bundles of old clothing under her arm, which she collected from
                              her wealthy friends and asking for addresses of sick and needy
                              striking families she might help,&quot; adding that Starr &quot;was on
                              the job day and night.&quot;<hi rend="sup">62</hi> In December 1915,
                              after the strike&apos;s termination, Hillman wrote Starr to thank her
                              for her support and for &quot;sympathy of the active and not the
                              passive kind shown by some other good friends.&quot; Hillman noted
                              that she had taken her place &quot;on the firing line, and personally
                              bore the insults of the police and private sluggers of the
                              employers,&quot; and inspired others by her &quot;very presence and

                         <p>This visible support from the Hull House activists and other elite women
                              played an important role in both shoring up and spreading general
                              public support for the strikers, as well as in turning up the pressure
                              on the employers. Starr noted that &quot; [t]he strike was written of
                              in several magazines,&quot; and that even those local dailies
                              &quot;naturally disposed in favor of those who advertise, gave it more
                              fair publicity than usual.&quot; Yet Starr also admitted that &quot;in
                              many respects this strike was like others&quot; because &quot;there
                              was the same array of money power, press power, police power, against
                              the relative powerlessness of the dispossessed, and the
                              unfranchised.&quot; She added that &quot;sixty percent of the strikers
                              were women, and even a larger percent of the men were not

                              arbitration was joined by no less than Addams, the State Board of

                              Wolman describes as &quot;specious and evasive statements&quot; from
                              <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName> Mayor Thompson. The Hull House activists, for their part,
                              unabashedly threw their support behind the strikers, and Addams made a
                              last, futile plea to the mayor for arbitration, admonishing him that
                              &quot;if you could be induced to take a hand in the matter we would be
                              able to make some order out of chaos.&quot;<hi rend="i">65</hi></p>
                         <p>Speaking (and writing) even more forcefully was Addams&apos;s long-time
                              friend Starr, who with Florence Kelley had also become the most
                              avowedly Socialist resident of Hull House. Starr admonished Jacob Abt,
                              the German Jewish clothier, president of the Wholesale Clothiers
                              Manufacturers&apos; Association, and benefactor of the Maxwell Street
                              Settlement, by drawing on two tenets of Jewish culture: a belief in
                              social justice and an abhorrence of &quot;un-American
                              persecution&quot; of Jews by their fellow Jews. Starr took Abt to task
                              for refusing to meet with her &quot;until after the strike is
                              over&quot; (if at all). Noting that a young boy at the Maxwell Street
                              settlement had thought she was Jewish because she seemed to be
                              &quot;always fighting for the Jews,&quot; she drily added that she was
                              simultaneously fighting against them. Abt&apos;s previous experience
                              as a settlement worker, she informed him, made him more accountable
                              than others &quot;for the needless horrors that are taking
                              place.&quot; Drawing on Jewish scripture, Starr noted that
                              &quot;[w]hen Isaiah rebukes the &apos;oppressor,&apos; the unfair
                              employer...he does so in these terms...&apos;What mean ye that ye beat
                              my people to pieces and grind the faces of the poor&quot;&apos; -- a
                              passage that, in its &quot;strong language on the side of the weak and
                              oppressed and against the privileged,&quot; was &quot;very different
                              from the language and the attitude of the police and of the daily
                              press.&quot; Starr then warned Abt: <quote rend="blockquote">A

                              embarrassment to German Jewish manufacturers like Abt who had stood
                              determined not to arbitrate with their Eastern European

                         <p>The rising tide of public support did not, however, finally translate
                              into success in inducing manufacturers to settle. On December 12,
                              1915, with both sides visibly worn down, the union reluctantly called
                              off its strike. The confrontation had essentially ended in a draw,
                              with no general union recognition, but with concessions from many
                              manufacturers, and the confidence that recognition would soon be
                                   forthcoming.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> Hillman wrote to Starr in late
                              December 1915 that while the clothing workers had not won all they
                              fought for, they had nonetheless gained something: &quot;Life is a
                              compromise, anyway, and we are satisfied if we have taken a little
                              step forward. We gave our employers a good fight and as you know our
                              retreat was far from being an unconditional surrender&quot; because
                              &quot;our people return to work as union men and women, with faith in
                              their organization and full of hope and courage for the

                         <p>Hillman, as Fraser noted, had viewed (and orchestrated) the strike as an

                              classes. Following his death on April 19, 1918, the Amalgamated
                              requested that all HSM employees attend the funeral; the company not
                              only requested the same, but also granted its employees a day of paid
                              leave.7&apos; Yet Schaffner, the liberal pioneer, paid a high price,

                              ing-class Jewish residents clearly did not take place in a vacuum.
                              Rather, the changes that spread from the workplace to the community
                              organizations were brought about by the efforts not only of radicals
                              and unionists, but also of Jewish organizations, prominent German
                              Jewish leaders, and non-Jewish progressive activists. During the
                              formative decade of the ACWA, visible change was taking place within
                              the city&apos;s established German Jewish community. Stirred by the
                              activism of their &quot;inferior&quot; coreligionists, a number of
                              German Jewish leaders -- both rabbinic and lay -- were forced to
                              rethink long-held assumptions about Eastern European Jews and their
                              relationship to them, both as givers of charity and as employers.
                              Although few of these leaders transcended their class biases, most
                              reflected to some degree the influence of the Progressive movement on

                              community included a rising and increasingly confident middle class.
                              The success of communal leaders such as Bernard Horwich, who had
                              gotten their start as &quot;cultural brokers&quot; to their own
                              community, played a vital role in helping the Eastern European Jewish
                              community gain co-equal status. The shifting alliances between Hull

                    <byline>DONNA J. DRUCKER </byline>






                    <p>After the Indiana University zoology professor Alfred Kinsey published his
                         first book of human sex research, <hi rend="i">Sexual Behavior in the Human
                              Male</hi>, in 1948, his correspondence became immense. And after <hi
                              rend="i">Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</hi> was published in
                         1953, he could barely keep up with the number of people who wanted his
                         advice, endorsement, and thoughts on sexual behavior.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                         Other correspondents wanted to praise or to condemn his work, and still
                         others shared sexual narratives with him, offered him sex-related materials
                         such as artwork and films, or wanted to contribute their own sexual
                         histories to his project. There are approximately seventy thousand
                         letters in the Alfred C. Kinsey Correspondence Collection at the Kinsey

                         from the period before Kinsey began his sex research in earnest. The
                         letters between Kinsey (1894-1956) and one of his graduate students, Ralph
                         Voris (1902-1940), are a rich source of information for understanding <list

                    <p>The letters between Kinsey and Voris demonstrate Kinsey&apos;s scientific
                         background, training, and priorities. Kinsey learned the art of insect
                         taxonomy from William Morton Wheeler, his graduate adviser at Harvard
                         University&apos;s Bussey Institution. Kinsey&apos;s graduate school note
                         book shows how he learned from Wheeler (a committed field naturalist) the
                         techniques of classification and speciation, or how to decide what
                         characteristics in a group of specimens should delineate species.<hi
                              rend="sup">2</hi> Kinsey chose the genus <hi rend="i">Cynips</hi> for
                         his dissertation and early research, in part because it was relatively
                         understudied in comparison to other insect genera, and he could make
                         significant contributions to speciation within it. Kinsey also came to
                         believe strongly, as Wheeler did, that scientific research should be based
                         primarily on observation and on the results of in-house breeding. At the
                         same time, Kinsey absorbed Wheeler&apos;s profound dislike of laboratory
                         genetics, which the senior man considered artificial and wrongheaded. He
                         originally agreed with his adviser that evolutionary research should not be
                         based on genetic manipulation of insects themselves, though he would soften
                         his position on laboratory research somewhat in the 1930s.<hi rend="sup"

                    <p>Kinsey published the three chapters of his dissertation and additional gall
                         wasp-related articles during the 1920s. His first book-length text,
                         &quot;Gall Wasp Genus Cynips,&quot; printed in 1929, was the most thor
                         ough revision of the genus <hi rend="i">Cynips</hi> to date, and it was the
                         book that Voris received with enthusiasm in the first letter reproduced
                         below. As taxonomers like Kinsey collected and described specimens in
                         lightly or poorly studied genera, they decided which specimens indicated
                         new species and which were examples, subspecies, or variations of existing
                         species. Then, as more specimens were available, taxonomers could dis-

                    <p>As Kinsey wrote to Voris throughout the 1930s, he was working on his second
                         book-length study of the genus <hi rend="i">Cynips</hi>, which included
                         both genera revisions and descriptions of new species. As that work
                         progressed, Kinsey thought that he had discovered new ways of under

                              >Origin of Higher Categories in Cynips</hi> (1936), he advocated

                         of life into &quot;an infrequently dividing chain in which the oldest

                         paleontology supplanting taxonomic research on the processes of
                         evolution. Not all species -- including gall wasps -- could be bred in
                         laboratories, and so it was necessary to continue collecting specimens in
                         the field, in addition to breeding in-house in order to determine
                         evolutionary patterns. Kinsey&apos;s students would learn to esteem
                         observation over laboratory experimentation as they trained to become
                         zoologists.</p>
                    <p>Ralph Voris was, at first, an inauspicious addition to the Indiana University
                         (IU) graduate student body. He arrived in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, in 1924
                         after receiving a bachelor&apos;s degree from Southwestern College in
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2037393" reg="Winfield">Winfield</settlement></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007254" reg="Kansas">Kansas</region></placeName>. He finished his doctorate in zoology on the taxonomy of
                         staphylinid beetles in 1928. Kinsey and Voris often took insect gathering
                         trips together, and Kinsey taught Voris the processes of collection,
                         organization, and description of species. Kinsey also instructed Voris
                         and his other graduate students, as Wheeler had instructed him, in the art
                         of drawing insect morphology. After Voris completed his dissertation, he
                         took a position teaching biology at Southwest Missouri State Teacher&apos;s
                         College (now Missouri State University) in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014532" reg="Springfield">Springfield</settlement></placeName>.</p>
                    <p>The letters reprinted below begin when Kinsey was a decade into establishing
                         himself in the intellectual world of evolutionary research and was
                         mentoring Voris, his first advisee. They show that Kinsey encouraged Voris
                         to work harder on the staphylinid beetles, in part so that Voris could make
                         a name for himself, and in part because Kinsey wanted to see if his
                         evolutionary ideas held for a different insect genus. Voris never published
                         more than a few articles, due to some extent to his significant teaching
                         responsibilities at an underfunded state teacher&apos;s college. He
                         remained at Southwest Missouri State until his death from heart failure in
                              1940.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> One letter of his is included below to

                         studying sexual behavior scientifically grew, the mention of sex in his
                         letters became more about his findings than about his own experiences.</p>
                    <p>The letters from Kinsey to Voris, along with one letter from former graduate
                         student Herman Spieth addressed to Voris and the &quot;Soaks&quot;
                         (Kinsey&apos;s other former graduate students), demonstrate that
                         Kinsey&apos;s defense of taxonomic research at the expense of laboratory
                         genetics did not elicit strong support in the evolutionary science
                         community, as he claimed to Voris. While Kinsey bragged to Voris about the
                         good reception he received from his fellow evolutionary scientists for <hi

                         late 1930s, evolutionary scientists were beginning to synthesize taxonomy,
                         genetics, and paleontology. That blending of methods and fields -- which
                         became the intellectual movement known as the modern or evolutionary
                         synthesis -- ran contrary to Kinsey&apos;s long-time prioritization of
                         taxonomy and observation.<hi rend="sup">8</hi></p>
                    <p>While Kinsey continued to publish his gall wasp research until 1942, he never
                         again resumed it with the same level of time and attention after
                         commencing his human sex research.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> In one letter, he
                         told Voris about some size correlations between the body parts of the same
                         species collected in the same locations after a ten-year time difference,
                         but he did not pursue those findings. He also never published on the genus
                              <hi rend="i">Xystoteras</hi> as he told Voris he would. While his
                         taxonomic training and knowledge of evolution were evident in his sex
                         research, he did not return to full-time evolutionary studies after
                         beginning his work on human sexuality. As the evolutionary synthesis
                         developed through the mid-1940s, there was little room for pure taxonomers

                         too highly to accede to that of evolutionary science and compromise his
                         intensive focus on taxonomic, observation-based scientific methods. The
                         Voris correspondence suggests that Kinsey&apos;s shift in research focus
                         was due in part to his discovery of an open field for research -- human
                         sexuality -- in which he could utilize his favored method of
                         scholarship.</p>
                    <p>These letters are an excellent source for Kinsey&apos;s thoughts as he
                         transitioned to human sex research. Kinsey did not write an autobiogra
                         phy, and these personal letters to Voris show Kinsey&apos;s increasing
                         enthusiasm for and interest in sex research between 1938 and 1940. They
                         narrate his journey from co-teaching a marriage course at IU, to
                         discovering that students were willing to talk to him about their sex
                         lives, to finding that others -- particularly members of homosexual
                         communities in Chicago -- would talk to him about their sex lives in-depth
                         as well. Kinsey&apos;s growing excitement about the possibilities of his
                         sex research is clear, especially as he began to interview men and women
                         outside of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement></placeName>. Aside from Voris, Kinsey had no other
                         correspondents whom he trusted with personal thoughts on his research. He
                         made no other reflections of equal depth and intimacy about his work that
                         survive.</p>
                    <p>Following Voris&apos;s death, Kinsey took custody of his book and beetle

                                                  burned off hot &amp; dry. When rains did come the
                                                  last half of August we had lost a lot of things.
                                                  Everything, however, is now green again, and we
                                                  feel better off than most of the drought area.
                                                  Have gotten more work done in the garden than in
                                                  the past 2 yrs. put together -- hence the best
                                                  spring garden is ahead of us, if we do not run
                                                  into drought again. Following your lead, I have
                                                  adopted shorts -- nothing more -- as the garden
                                                  costume, and have the best tan ever -- more than I
                                                  ever thought a bleached blonde could have. And the
                                                  most glorious live feeling that my skin has ever
                                                  known. Incidentally, I weigh just 20 pounds less
                                                  than I did in February -- from 162 to 142 -- and
                                                  practically all that came off the waistline. Had
                                                  all my trousers let out last February, and now
                                                  every pair is in folds at the waist. I shall see
                                                  to it that something or other keeps that winter
                                                  damage off of me this year! And, would you believe
                                                  it! When hot weather came on, I went to the city
                                                  swimming pool (which my family patronizes every
                                                  day), and finding it hot as soup, I turned to the
                                                  [Indiana] University pool and -- swam at the end
                                                  of every day until school closed!</p>
                                             <p>[That was] the first I have been in the University
                                                  pool since you deserted me here. I shall have to
                                                  get into it a few times each week thruout this
                                                  next school year. Even as poor a fish as I have
                                                  been[, I] have been able to improve some of my
                                                  amphibious doings, and I found swimming great
                                                  fun this summer. After the Univ. pool closed, the
                                                  whole family took to <placeName><region type="county" key="tgn_1002209" reg="Brown">Brown County</region></placeName> days: swimming

                                                  established, I think, that the higher categories
                                                  are nothing but sections in a continuous chain of
                                                  species -- the divisions between the categories
                                                  purely arbitrary unless one has limited his
                                                  collecting to an incomplete portion of the range,
                                                  or unless nature has obligingly exterminated some
                                                  of the older species. There is no tree of life --
                                                  the simile should be to the creeping vine or plant
                                                  with runners. The first species of the new genus
                                                  is as closely related to the last species of the
                                                  old, as any two species are to the other within
                                                  the genus. Higher categories arise merely as
                                                  species -- by mutation or hybridization and
                                                  subsequent isolation -- with no greater degree of
                                                  difference than is involved in the origin of any
                                                  other species.</p>

                                                  to delay along the line to get material to fill in
                                                  the gaps. If not a genus, can it be a complex or

                                                  haven&apos;t half a dozen who are really getting
                                                  anywhere on research -- and my best friends on
                                                  Harvard faculty are forever cursing their
                                                  &quot;poor benighted institution&quot; (not in
                                                  public). If anything better comes along, I will
                                                  turn it your way, but I want the answers from

                                                  pages. Have 4 grad. students to train into field
                                                  work -- Lord knows 2 of them need it, and the
                                                  other two can still polish up -- and there is the
                                                  shocking news that the Mexican government may

                                                  before. Might take Mrs. Kinsey with me -- would
                                                  like to have her see the country, and fear we
                                                  would have to finance most of the trip ourselves

                                                  a spring full of work -- and I really have gotten
                                                  things done even if some other things have had to
                                                  slide. Any amount of detail to follow up after the
                                                  return from the Mexican trip. Plenty of technique
                                                  [needed for] handling the new material. Bad luck
                                                  on breeding much of it, for the very sudden
                                                  arrival of low temperatures, followed by the very
                                                  arid spring &amp; summer, has [recruci fied?] most
                                                  of the pupae. Can&apos;t be helped tho -- and we
                                                  have gotten thousands of good adults. Then I
                                                  finished the volume on Methods in Teaching
                                                  Biology. Lippincott has it in publication now --
                                                  to bear a 1937 copyright. Next I expanded the
                                                  second Cynips volume (Origin of Higher Categories)
                                                  to include the winter&apos;s collections and got
                                                  that to press here in the University. Two volumes
                                                  which have been in brew for 5 years, both
                                                  completed at last. Immediately I have started on
                                                  the next monograph -- Xystoteras is the genus --
                                                  a larger group than Cynips -- I have perhaps twice
                                                  as much material -- perhaps 20 species have been
                                                  passing as &quot;Andricus&quot; -- 150 species are
                                                  new. I will finish this in a year or 18 mos. at
                                                  the rate it is going -- and it will cover more ground
                                                  than the 2 Cynips volumes on which I spent nine
                                                  years. At long last I may be able to convince
                                                  somebody that I have been laying a foundation in
                                                  all these 18 years -- on which the finished
                                                  structure may now rise rapidly. While on Cynips I
                                                  had to take a year and a half to lay the
                                                  foundation of the generic rearrangement of the
                                                  whole family -- a matter of 6 months to solve the
                                                  long-wing, short-wing riddle, much time over many
                                                  years to make catalogs and orchestrate literature
                                                  -- endless technique in preparing collected
                                                  material for future study. Now, suddenly, it has
                                                  all come to a head -- everything is ready for the
                                                  new study, and I am writing thousands of
                                                  specimens and ten or a dozen new species into the
                                                  manuscript each week. That is the fruition of the
                                                  dream I have had about building for a life-time of
                                                  research. -- But it is a dangerous program if one
                                                  gets bumped off prematurely!</p>
                                             <p>About the [Adalbert] Fenyes collection -- I doubt if
                                                  I should buy it if I were in your position.
                                                  Material bought or bagged from other collectors
                                                  (save your own good self) had rarely been
                                                  comparable to material collected by myself. Small
                                                  series, few distribution data -- lack of the
                                                  background of the biologic conditions,
                                                  physiography of area involved, <pb n="84"

                                                  greatly reduce the value of most other material.
                                                  If you are anxious to spend part of your savings,
                                                  put it into your own field work. If you bought the
                                                  whole collection, there would be next to no chance
                                                  to sell off any part. Museums, etc. prefer to send
                                                  their own men into the field -- and hope to have all
                                                  the big collections given to them some day,
                                                  anyway. I know of very, very few purchases by
                                                  private collectors. -- The library would be more
                                                  valuable to you -- wish you might purchase what
                                                  you really need out of it ...</p>
                                             <p>As for the Staphy[linid] distribution -- I have no
                                                  preconceived theories. Every new Cynipid I study
                                                  upsets all previous experience, so you will have
                                                  to accept the facts as you find them. Mid-West

                                                  follow your final conclusions! -- And don&apos;t
                                                  be frightened at the confusion in a beginning
                                                  generic revision. I worked 9 years on Cynips
                                                  before it finally suited me.</p>
                                             <p>And now for the secret -- as to why I am writing
                                                  this on a train. There is a 3-day Genetics Conf.
                                                  at Iowa State College (<placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013295" reg="Ames">Ames</settlement></placeName>) with [Sewall] Wright,
                                                  [R. A.] Fisher, [L. J.] Stadler, (and [E. W.]
                                                  Lindstrom?) on the program. Only 3 papers per day
                                                  -- all the rest round tables on application of
                                                  genetic data to evolution. It looks as if it would
                                                  be a very small group, several active workers, and
                                                  perhaps a real chance to question there [sic]
                                                  every conclusion and get their reaction to a mere
                                                  taxon omist&apos;s criticisms. Perhaps a score of
                                                  people there -- therefore, the great advantages
                                                  over the Christmas meetings. I am out for
                                                  information and criticism of my own findings. I

                                             <salute>My dear Dr. Voris:</salute>
                                             <p>I find that I am going to be [at] the AAAS [American
                                                  Association for the Advancement of Science]
                                                  meetings at <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013332" reg="Atlantic City">Atlantic City</settlement></placeName> [, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007565" reg="New Jersey">New Jersey</region></placeName>]. The
                                                  Naturalists are to have a symposium on December 31
                                                  on the evolution of higher categories. When they
                                                  first asked me to take part I refused on the
                                                  ground that I have little to give them that was
                                                  not already in print. Nevertheless they insisted.
                                                  [Edgar] Anderson of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014444" reg="Saint Louis">St. Louis</settlement></placeName>, and [William K.]
                                                  Gregory and [George Gaylord] Simpson of the
                                                  American Museum of Natural History are to be the
                                                  other speakers. We have had preliminary
                                                  conferences and find that we are very largely
                                                  agreed, so there should not be the fireworks
                                                  exhibit that we had at  <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014444" reg="Saint Louis">St. Louis</settlement></placeName> last year.</p>
                                             <p>I wonder if there is any chance of your going with
                                                  me to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013332" reg="Atlantic City">Atlantic City</settlement></placeName>? I shall not attempt to make
                                                  the trip by car at that season, and that will make
                                                  it very expensive, but if there is any chance of
                                                  your going that would be great. Mrs. Kinsey would
                                                  be delighted to have Mrs. Voris stay with her. Let
                                                  me know soon so I will know what to do about
                                                  reservations.</p>
                                             <p>Yours sincerely,</p> <p>Alfred C. Kinsey</p> <p>Professor of

                                             <p>Stenographers aside -- we should be delighted to
                                                  have a visit from both of you. We have completed
                                                  our second-floor rooms, so could take care of you
                                                  better than formerly. There is much to talk about
                                                  -- last <placeName><country key="tgn_7005560" reg="México">Mex</country></placeName>. trip to account for -- I want to hear
                                                  about Philonthus. I find a note here &amp; there,
                                                  now &amp; again, that lets me know you are at it.
                                                  I may get to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014444" reg="Saint Louis">St. Louis</settlement></placeName> to confer with Anderson
                                                  about the symposium. It would be this Sat. or the
                                                  following week-end. That seems so near <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014532" reg="Springfield">Springfield</settlement></placeName>

                                                  It is taking work to get together enough new
                                                  material to make the symposium paper something
                                                  more than repetition.</p>

                                             <salute>Dear Ralph:</salute>
                                             <p>Your last letter should have been answered long
                                                  before this -- I have thought of you often enough,
                                                  Lord knows, but been snowed under with aftermath
                                                  of the second Cynips publication, the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013332" reg="Atlantic City">Atlantic City</settlement></placeName> Symposium, several Journal articles, etc. The
                                                  reaction to the new Cynips volume is the most
                                                  encouraging thing yet -- especially on top of the
                                                  fact that it was delayed a year in publication
                                                  because of the doubts the publication committee
                                                  had about it. Perhaps neglect more than doubts. At
                                                  any rate, they held the Ms. [manuscript] 3 months
                                                  without doing anything about it, then submitted
                                                  it to a taxonomist and a geneticist for crit
                                                  icism. Taxonomist said the taxonomy was OK and
                                                  important, but the genetics unprintably bad.
                                                  Geneticist said the genetics was sound enough, but
                                                  the taxonomy certainly not in accord with current
                                                  work in taxonomy. They mussed about with it so
                                                  long I took back the Ms., put it in the bank vault
                                                  while I was in <placeName><country key="tgn_7005560" reg="México">Mexico</country></placeName>, and refused to give it to
                                                  them for six months after my return. By that time,
                                                  [Fernandus] Payne was quite [meek?] about it.</p>
                                             <p>-- At any rate, you have seen [Clarence H. ]
                                                  Kennedy&apos;s lavish praise. The geneticists are
                                                  strong for it -- have had most interesting
                                                  correspondence with a lot of them. [Theodosius]
                                                  Dobzhansky, Sewall Wright, [Albert Francis]
                                                  Blakeslee, Anderson, [Arthur Mangun] Banta, etc.,
                                                  etc. all quite convinced. Anderson has objected
                                                  for all these years that I had a very special case
                                                  in these bugs -- that such major mutations were not
                                                  to be expected in most groups. Now he writes he is
                                                  quite convinced that it is my method that is
                                                  unique -- that he can believe that the use of as
                                                  diverse means for recognizing relationships in
                                                  other groups might show relationships that we have
                                                  overlooked because of our dependence on
                                                  morphologic similarity. He was handsome in his
                                                  acceptance of this at the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013332" reg="Atlantic City">Atlantic City</settlement></placeName> symposium.
                                                  A number of the paleontologists have testified
                                                  that their fossil connecting links make categories
                                                  just what I find them. Even a number of the
                                                  taxonomists are enthusiastic -- tho they as a
                                                  group offer the most objections. You are going to
                                                  see a day when taxonomic contributions will be
                                                  accepted as a fundamental part of biologic
                                                  science, sir. And I am most anxious to know what
                                                  your bugs are going to contribute to it.</p>
                                             <p>I am delighted to know that Philonthus is moving.
                                                  Were you flesh and blood of my own, I could get no
                                                  more satisfaction out of the research you turn
                                                  out. These other folk have a few printed pages of
                                                  my ideas, a few minutes of verbal explanation. You

                                                  have so much better grasp of my thinking -- and I
                                                  shall, therefore, be more interested in seeing how
                                                  you react to it, modify it in the light of your
                                                  own data, what you reject, what you accept, what
                                                  you carry it on into. I spent a couple of days in

                                                  collection, home, etc. His series of mayflies,
                                                  extensive records, etc., make me feel he is some
                                                  child of mine. Glad the NYA has contributed help
                                                  to you. [Osmond P.] Breland has help too. I am
                                                  interested to know you have gone to Nat. Mus.
                                                  Trays -- each group will have its own best
                                                  technique. Spieth has gone to double size Schmitt
                                                  boxes. The Schmitt boxes still are the best unit
                                                  for me (I get about 800 insects in a box by my new
                                                  arrangement.) -- And, by the way, if you are
                                                  discarding your old Schmitt boxes, I will buy them
                                                  from you personally. Let me know.</p>
                                             <p>I discovered at <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013332" reg="Atlantic City">Atlantic City</settlement></placeName> that you were already
                                                  booked for C.C.N.Y. [City College of New York]
                                                  next summer -- so I have not hurried about my
                                                  advice. It is [a] most hearty approval of the
                                                  plan. It will give you new atmosphere (hot &amp;
                                                  dirty as <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7007567" reg="New York">New York</settlement></placeName> is in the summer), and just the
                                                  many contacts you most need. Library, museum
                                                  collections, etc. Go to it. But don&apos;t forget
                                                  that the previous visit to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement></placeName> is an
                                                  indispensable part of it. For long enough time to
                                                  really do something! There are worlds to talk
                                                  about, scientific problems to discuss, more gos
                                                  sip than we can hope to cover short of days. Added
                                                  over 300 volumes to my own library in the last 6
                                                  months -- surely there ought to be enough to do to
                                                  keep you here a while. Our home is yours as long
                                                  as you will stay. Mrs. Kinsey will be delighted to
                                                  have as much time with Geraldine as I want with
                                                  you -- and the four of us should find enough in
                                                  common to make it a delight...</p>
                                             <p>On another subject -- if you get to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7007567" reg="New York">New York</settlement></placeName> and see
                                                  what I saw during the holidays, you will wiggle as
                                                  you ne&apos;er have before -- and you may warn
                                                  Geraldine of that before you go. Burlesque at
                                                  Broadway has the most gorgeously thrilling girls I
                                                  ever except [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] to see -- And
                                                  they stop at nothing. The G. strings to which they
                                                  finally strip are half as wide as your little
                                                  finger, and not a button wider at the strategic
                                                  spot. When the audience insists strenuously
                                                  enough, she will remove even the string --
                                                  slipping a finger in place (to live up to the law)
                                                  -- with more damaging effect than the complete
                                                  exposure of a nudist camp. Breland says it is
                                                  criminal for such shows to go on in establishments
                                                  that are not provided with side rooms where
                                                  gentlemen may change their trousers and have
                                                  shower baths -- but the audiences seem to like it,
                                                  to the extent of packing half the shows on

                                             <p>Did you see [Richard] Goldschmidt&apos;s article in
                                                  <hi rend="i">American Naturalist</hi> in which he
                                                  criticized Kinsey very severely? I might say that
                                                  several of the men in the museum [American Museum
                                                  of Natural History] who think very well of Kinsey
                                                  feel that the criticisms are justified.
                                                  Kinsey&apos;s last paper has also been criticized
                                                  by the ornithologists, particularly because of his
                                                  use of the term species instead of subspecies.
                                                  They feel that if he had used subspecies, his

                                                  very excellent, and have ordered a copy -- but it
                                                  has not yet arrived....</p>
                                             <p>By the way, Dr. Payne came through our city a month
                                                  or so ago and we had a little visit with him then.
                                                  Amongst other things (and this is strictly on the
                                                  confidential side), we heard that Uncle Alf and
                                                  the younger men of the Dept. have had some rather
                                                  serious disagreements. Most of it, it seems, stems
                                                  from the new course which [William R.] Breneman
                                                  and [Robert L.] Kroc are giving. I hope it
                                                  isn&apos;t too serious. Another complication
                                                  arises evidently from the possibility of
                                                  Payne&apos;s retirement as Head of the Dept. and
                                                  his probable successor. Apparently no one but
                                                  Kinsey wants Kinsey to have that post ...</p>

                                             <p>Hope the enclosed reaches you safely. It offends my
                                                  sense of rhythm in places -- so I have made some
                                                  emendations. As for its other effects on me, I
                                                  shall have to report sometime when we have better
                                                  opportunity. Tho I would suggest that you try the
                                                  thing with the ♂ as the narrator -- same story, same
                                                  ♀ or ♂, but ♂ accounting for the first
                                                  person. -- Incidentally, it never rains but it pours.
                                                  To my surprise, I find one of our faculty men here
                                                  (not on the zoo[logy] faculty) has a collection

                                                  physio-anatomical research purposes elsewhere. If

                                                  to have so little time with you. Let&apos;s hope

                                             <p>News is endless. Out of all our political shakeup
                                                  here, it looks as if [Paul V.] McNutt were now out

                                                  running strong in newspaper comment. Not bad --
                                                  in fact, very good as an executive, but not too
                                                  long on scholarship. We have a faculty
                                                  &quot;Survey Committee&quot; -- and it is going to
                                                  [the] rock bottom of everything, no regard for any
                                                  precedents -- men of my age -- consequently our
                                                  generation rides strong in this reorganization.
                                                  Payne has been away 4 or 5 [weeks] out of this

                                                  does pay to hammer at things, and strike for big

                                                  finally moved Dr. Payne to the point where he
                                                  actually went after these things -- and was
                                                  surprised to get them.</p>

                                                  fix my future here. If it comes out right in this
                                                  shuffle, I.U. will be a good place to stay; if it
                                                  is screwed up as some things threaten to be, I
                                                  shall be in the market for another job. Some place
                                                  where there is active genetic work, and a graduate
                                                  program that allows a better grounding for
                                                  taxonomic-cytologic-genetic studies. Perhaps we
                                                  can build that here.</p>
                                             <p>Man -- most of all, I want to know more about your
                                                  Philonthus, and I have concluded I shall not
                                                  unless I come to Springfield and see it. So you
                                                  are going to see us -- if you will have us

                                             <salute>Dear Ralph:</salute>
                                             <p>It was a good trip we had together, and many thanks
                                                  to you for everything in it. Sorry I have been
                                                  delayed in writing since getting back. It has been
                                                  a grand whirl to get the semester finished, work
                                                  out the arrangements for the new semester,
                                                  etc.</p>
                                             <p>I have started toward five hundred measurements from
                                                  a fourth locality. Been making simple distribution
                                                  curves for some of the other characters, and made
                                                  a half dozen more of the correlation diagrams. All
                                                  of them show that peculiar double drift except the
                                                  thorax abdomen set. Have had a couple of sessions
                                                  with the astronomer in the institution, who is our
                                                  best trained man in statistics, and by chance
                                                  there have been two statisticians visiting here in
                                                  the department since we have gotten back.
                                                  Consequently I have had an abundance of help in
                                                  planning the next moves. They are all very much
                                                  excited, say that the double drift is an extremely
                                                  rare thing, that it contains some mistery [sic]
                                                  that warrants any amount of work to unravel,
                                                  decide that I need at least a thousand from each
                                                  locality in order to have enough in each part of
                                                  the map to allow analysis of each part separately,
                                                  etc. The young astronomer has dropped in now a
                                                  couple of times since his first visit, he is so
                                                  interested in seeing how the thing progresses. So
                                                  I am all set up about the possibilities that lie
                                                  in the work.</p>

                                                  gotten more satisfaction from publication of any
                                                  of my own material. It has been a rotten shame
                                                  that they were not out long ago -- and is, I
                                                  agree, a shame that it did not come out as one big
                                                  paper. But in many ways this publication of
                                                  several things will do you more good -- and bring
                                                  the attention and cooperation that will help. The
                                                  papers are fine stuff, sir, even if I should be
                                                  more modest over something coming from out [of]
                                                  our laboratories -- but I repeat that they are
                                                  darn good stuff, and you may be proud of them.
                                                  God, man -- I feel guilty that we have not managed
                                                  to get them out for you before this. In time, let

                                             <p>It has been too long since I have heard from you --
                                                  or I have written. This has been the busiest 6
                                                  months, I think, that I have ever spent. I have
                                                  measured some thousands of bugs and gotten a
                                                  series of variation curves and correlation in maps
                                                  that is startling. Even if I have not gotten
                                                  around to the letter writing, I think of the
                                                  decent help you gave every time I look at the
                                                  correlation maps. There is no question that the
                                                  population in each locality is different from
                                                  that in any other. They differ in range of
                                                  variation for each character, in mode and shape of
                                                  curve. They differ in correlations: in density at
                                                  diff. pts., in location of drift, in extent of
                                                  drift.</p>
                                             <p>The close identity of the two correlation maps we
                                                  made at Richmond is not continued thruout the
                                                  series. There are genetic -- mutational or
                                                  whatnot factors that modify the locations of the
                                                  drifts. The ends of the series are two different
                                                  genera-but there are no discontinuities -- it is
                                                  an accumulation of local differences. The only
                                                  real discontinuity comes where the High Plains
                                                  cuts between the Rocky MT [Mountains] and Eastern
                                                  forest area-and there too much of the story is
                                                  lost. -- Have you had a chance to consider local
                                                  variation in Staphys? My man [Albert P.] Blair is
                                                  getting a most remarkable series on toads -- it
                                                  includes every so-called species of toad in the
                                                  US, except one peculiar runt in Florida. It looks
                                                  as if we were getting a low-down on the nature of
                                                  species. By invitation of the eugenicists -- I was

                                                  interest in key gall wasp curves. Think I will put
                                                  on an exhibit at the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013645" reg="Columbus">Columbus</settlement></placeName> meetings....</p>

                                                  prospered and multiplied work. In the first four
                                                  semesters we have had 100, 200, 230, 260=790
                                                  students. A few flurries with unfavorable
                                                  criticisms from older faculty who had no firsthand
                                                  knowledge -- but even that is gone. The students
                                                  would do anything for us, their appreciation is so
                                                  great. We have their written comments at the end
                                                  of each semester. Several have written personal
                                                  letters to express their appreciation for their
                                                  personal benefit. Following your suggestion, we

                                                  Man -- I hope to prove to the world someday that any
                                                  subject may be a profitable field for scientific
                                                  research if zealously pursued and handled with
                                                  objective scholarship. We have over 350
                                                  histories now -- I will have my 1000 within
                                                  another year and a half. Gosh, I wish I could show
                                                  you these data, the summaries etc. I have
                                                  presented a progress report to our faculty discus
                                                  sion club, nearly bowled some of them over -- but
                                                  they were game and objective, and most encouraging
                                                  in their approval of further investigation. Wish
                                                  you were here to see this material. I have just
                                                  come back from the trip to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName> -- that we
                                                  talked of last Xmas -- safe and sound -- with
                                                  eight histories the like of which is in no
                                                  published study. Again -- wish I could summarize
                                                  for you, or show you the detailed histories.</p>
                                             <p>What are you doing this summer? Has the trip to the
                                                  Southeast materialized? I hope so -- am not clear
                                                  whether you intend to go this summer or this fall.
                                                  It is probable that I will go back over our 1929
                                                  route, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007158" reg="Colorado">Colo</region></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007827" reg="Utah">Utah</region></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7006451" reg="Arizona">Ariz</region></placeName> -- plus some additional
                                                  localities -- to duplicate our collections on this
                                                  variable-winged insect. Shades of the good trip we
                                                  had together then! Mac will go with me, probably
                                                  Bruce -- the girls will both be in summer camp for
                                                  part of the time, home here with Mrs. Turrell (who
                                                  helps Mrs. Kinsey) for the rest of the time.
                                                  Cannot leave until after the middle of August.
                                                  Have to be back by Sept. 15. I am teaching
                                                  Entomology and Evolution this summer (10 hrs
                                                  credit) plus the Marriage Course. A total of 27
                                                  hours scheduled class-room work per week, plus
                                                  more than that in individual conferences. But I
                                                  thrive, nevertheless. -- what with a half day Sat.
                                                  &amp; the whole day Sunday in the garden. Wish the
                                                  Vorises could see the garden now. It has rained
                                                  abundantly this year, everything luscious green --
                                                  the day-lilies giving more color now than the
                                                  irises in their season. We have acquired the lot
                                                  to the West of us -- a hold-up financially, but
                                                  we at least know that no one can build close to
                                                  us. Planted 250 shrubs &amp; trees on the new
                                                  place this year.</p>

                                                  arriving. You said you wanted to see it -- I am
                                                  sure you will. So come when you can -- you and
                                                  Geraldine. Hope she is well, your year has not
                                                  been too grueling -- and the best to both of

                                             <p>We too were much disappointed that we did not see
                                                  you both in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014532" reg="Springfield">Springfield</settlement></placeName> when we passed thru in
                                                  September. Thanks for the nice letter, with its
                                                  cordial wishes from both you and Geraldine. Do
                                                  wish we could see more of each other. Seems as if
                                                  we get busier every year -- with the last year the
                                                  busiest I have ever had.</p>
                                             <p>I have kept the cynipid work going, tho it has
                                                  slowed because of the other research problem. Have
                                                  measured more bugs since you helped me on the
                                                  first correlation maps last Christmas from more
                                                  localities -- and made many more correlations.
                                                  Latest development is the startling discovery that
                                                  <hi rend="i">every</hi> single character (head
                                                  width, body length, wing variation, leg colors,
                                                  etc., etc.) is correlated with <hi rend="i"
                                                  >every</hi> other. What are the mechanisms? I
                                                  think the geneticist assumption that nothing but
                                                  genic correlation mechanisms can be involved is
                                                  not better than the suggestion for an
                                                  embryonic-physiologic correlation mechanism. What
                                                  are the evolutionary implications?</p>
                                             <p>The Marriage Course has taken some time to manage --
                                                  but infinitely more in connection with the
                                                  personal conferences. Could never have afforded
                                                  that time if it had not been the source of a
                                                  research project that grows constantly more
                                                  exciting. I had about 75 histories when you were
                                                  East last Xmas. Now have about 570 -- which means
                                                  we will have accumulated over 500 in the year from
                                                  Xmas to Xmas. Average 1 1/2 hr. each -- some 3 hr.
                                                  or more -- so you can see where <hi rend="i"
                                                  >some</hi> of my time has gone. It is the most
                                                  complete exhaustive record ever had on single
                                                  individuals, and already 2 1/2 times as much in
                                                  quantity as the best published study has. While
                                                  agreeing with previous studies as far as they go,
                                                  our data go much further. Since we are getting
                                                  entirely new types of histories and still new
                                                  slants on interpretations, as we get additional
                                                  histories, it becomes clear that we need many
                                                  more before we have begun to top the true study of
                                                  human sexual behavior. Will get my first thousand
                                                  men in another year or so, when I will publish the

                                             <salute>My dear Ralph:</salute>
                                             <p>I suppose this letter should be addressed to Gerry,
                                                  for she has been splendid in writing me twice
                                                  recently. The letter is therefore to both of you,
                                                  but particularly to you. I wish it might
                                                  contribute something to cheering you up.</p>
                                             <p>Of course, I am terribly sorry to know of your
                                                  physical difficulties, though I am immediately
                                                  encouraged to know that they have found nothing
                                                  that is going to cause permanent difficulty. It is
                                                  a shame, a perfect shame, and I hope it will
                                                  bring everyone from your president down, to a
                                                  realization of what is needed to prevent another
                                                  break-up ...</p>
                                             <p>I have settled down almost to a constant schedule of
                                                  being out-of-town the last few days in the week.
                                                  It is the research on human sex behavior that has
                                                  piled on the extra load. At the start it was a
                                                  problem to get contributors to our histories; now
                                                  it is a scramble to find time to record all of
                                                  those that are offered. The students here on the
                                                  campus are increasingly getting the habit of
                                                  coming over. I recently had two whole fraternity
                                                  groups offer 100% [ -- ]that is invaluable because
                                                  it gives us the nearest substitute that seems
                                                  possible for a random sample.</p>
                                             <p>Every day mail brings requests from the outside for
                                                  conferences whenever I travel their way. Within
                                                  the past month I have lectured at the request of a
                                                  clergyman in a small town where I picked up ten
                                                  histories on the day following my lecture. I have
                                                  given a series of three lectures to a group of 180
                                                  parents at Anderson [University], and during the
                                                  past month staying over in the town for a day
                                                  following each lecture, and getting histories of
                                                  every variety from parents to high school boys and
                                                  girls. The people in the high school are so
                                                  enthusiastic that they promise me 1000 histories
                                                  there if I want to take the time for them.</p>

                                                  could get several hundred out of that building if
                                                  I could find the time. My <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName> and <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014444" reg="Saint Louis">St. Louis</settlement></placeName>

                                                  tabulations, curves, correlation charts, etc. are
                                                  beginning to be impressive. There continues to be

                                                  faculty who object to all this, but an increasing
                                                  number of the faculty are offering a very definite
                                                  cooperation. The people in physiology, psychology,
                                                  and sociology have had long sessions with me, and
                                                  are offering definite cooperation on their aspects
                                                  of the matter. How I wish I could discuss all this
                                                  with you at length.</p>

                                                  a week or two? Spring is already beginning with
                                                  us, and within two weeks our garden will be a mass
                                                  of bloom. We have over 3,000 new bulbs into the
                                                  ground last fall, and that added to our previous
                                                  plantings should give us the finest garden
                                                  ever....</p>
                                             <p>Gee, I wish you and I could get together for some
                                                  hours in the sun shine which we have here today.

                                                  have under way, and immediately suggests several
                                                  foundations that would be glad to cooperate with
                                                  the resources. It looks as if it was going to take

                                                  have. Without any expansion of program, there is

                                                  time to come. As usual, the puslishers [sic] are
                                                  after me for text books in biology, for both high

                    <p>Prohibition is often dismissed as an unfortunate aberration in the American
                         reform tradition, led by fanatics, and doomed to failure. Jason S. Lantzer
                         seeks to correct this impression in a well-written and thoroughly
                         documented study on the life and career of Edward S. Shumaker, state
                         superintendent of the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> Anti-Saloon League from 1907 until his
                         untimely death in 1929. Drawing on a wide variety of secondary and pri
                         mary sources, including Shumaker&apos;s personal papers, Lantzer stresses
                         the deep link between evangelical Protestantism and American politics,
                         and the need to view the dry movement within this context. Shumaker, who
                         had earlier served as a Methodist minister in several <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>
                         communities, is lauded as &quot;a first-rate political tactician&quot;
                         whose life &quot;is a shining example of the dry crusade,&quot;
                         illustrating &quot;the evolution of prohibition over time&quot; (p. 3).</p>


                    <p>Lantzer is particularly effective in his discussion of the intricacies of the
                         IASLs involvement in Hoosier politics, and in describing how its goals
                         and strategies sometimes conflicted with those of other dry organizations
                         such as the Women&apos;s Christian Temperance League and the Prohibition
                         Party. He also considers tepid attempts of Shumaker and the IASL to
                         cooperate with African American church groups, and alliances formed with
                         Roman Catholics. If some national Anti-Saloon leaders were lividly
                         anti-Catholic, Shumaker cultivated cordial relations with Catholic drys;
                         indeed at one point a priest served under him as IASL vice president. But
                         the appearance of the Ku Klux Klan brought complications.</p>
                    <p>The Klan became a significant social and political force in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> during
                         the early and mid-1920s, not too long after the Anti-Saloon League and
                         other dry groups had ostensibly <pb n="103" id="VAA4025-106-1-111"/>
                         attained victory with the passage of statewide prohibition in 1917 and the
                         implementation of the Eighteenth Amendment nationwide in 1920.
                         <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>&apos;s adoption of the strict Wright &quot;bone-dry&quot; law in
                         1925 was perhaps the IASEs crowning achievement. Effective enforcement was
                         difficult, but Lantzer argues that prohibition significantly reduced
                         alcohol consumption and that &quot;crime stayed remarkably in check&quot;
                         (p. 3). The author needs to present more evidence to support such broad
                         assertions, yet Lantzer convincingly demonstrates that Shumaker&apos;s
                         ties with the Klan were tenuous. The IASL and Klan overlapped in their con
                         stituencies, with both organizations appealing to Protestant congregations.
                         Both supported the enforcement of prohibition, but the Klan utilized mil
                         itant and even violent tactics shunned by the IASL, and Shumaker pursued
                         his own independent political course. Lantzer acknowledges, however, that
                         &quot;both real and imagined associations between the ASL and the Klan hurt
                         the League,&quot; (p. 131) and destroyed any possibility of maintaining a
                         constructive coalition of evangelical Protestants, Catholics, and African
                         Americans.</p>
                    <p>A vicious political dispute with state Attorney General Arthur Gilliom
                         involving the election of an <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> Supreme Court justice and the
                         enforcement of dry statutes led ultimately to Shumaker&apos;s conviction
                         on contempt charges and a sixty-day prison sentence. Shumaker became, in
                         Lantzer&apos;s words, &quot;a martyr for the dry cause&quot; (p. 157).
                         Released from jail in April 1929, he soon fell seriously ill with a
                         variety of maladies, and died from a malignant tumor in October at age 62,
                         a few years before repeal.</p>
                    <p>This work should be an extremely useful resource for those wishing to learn
                         more about the dry movement, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> politics, and Shumaker&apos;s
                         life. It is hence a shame the book&apos;s index is so perfunctory. Some may
                         disagree with this sympathetic portrayal of Shumaker or with the
                         author&apos;s claims regarding the merits and accomplishments of
                         prohibition, yet few would doubt his contention that substance abuse
                         remains a daunting problem today. Lantzer helps us better understand
                         Shumaker&apos;s perspective, the religious culture that nurtured him, and
                         the important role that the Anti-Saloon League played in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>.</p>

                    <head><hi rend="i">The Hoosier Cabinet in Kitchen History</hi><lb/> By Nancy R.
                         Hiller<lb/> (<placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement></placeName>: Indiana University Press, 2009. Pp. xii, 144.

                    <p>The Hoosier cabinet, manufactured and marketed in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, was a particular
                         kind of kitchen furniture developed at the very end of the nineteenth
                         century and sold into the 1930s. Hoosier cabinets provided bins for flour
                         and sugar, and shelves for china and canned goods; a flour sifter was built
                         in. At waist height was a countertop on which the housewife could mix her
                         dough or prepare other aspects of the meal. The cabinets, as author Nancy
                         Hiller observes, still enjoy popularity among collectors today.</p>
                    <p>Hiller, who is a cabinetmaker rather than a trained historian, opens her book
                         with the general history of the kitchen and a focus on the history of
                         <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> kitchens. In kitchens of the nineteenth century, separate case
                         pieces or built-in shelves were used for the storage of dishes, glassware,
                         silver, pots and pans, and other kitchen equipment. By 1890 practically
                         all middle-class and some working-class houses had a separate pantry to
                         add more storage. The Hoosier cabinet was marketed as a more modern
                         version of kitchen storage in that it provided specific spaces for storing
                         foodstuffs and condensed the housewife&apos;s work areas into one
                         station.</p>
                    <p>The author provides interesting information about the early context from
                         which Hoosier cabinets emerged. Furniture making had already been
                         widespread in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> by the 1830s, rooted in the variety of native trees.
                         One <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> company produced the Wooton desk, sold across the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country></placeName>
                         and abroad. Outfitted with numerous drawers especially sized for bills,
                         envelopes, and other record-keeping materials, its everything-in-its place
                         attitude was a precursor to the Hoosier cabinet. The success of the
                         cabinets was also due to the new profession of sales; salesmen traveled the
                         country with new products, and print sources such as the Montgomery Ward
                         catalog (begun in 1872) and the Sears, Roebuck catalogs (begun in the
                         1890s) spread consumer goods. The first Hoosier cabinet salesmen carted a
                         few cabinets among a wagonload of goods, but soon discovered that their
                         cabinets sold more quickly than any other product. Manufacturers marketed
                         the Hoosier cabinet as a particularly modern time-saving device, and
                         salesmen pushed it as a special gift to housewives from considerate,
                         progressive husbands. Analyzing the advertisements produced by <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>
                         manufacturers, Hiller notices that the cabinet was promoted to women as a
                         step-saving device so that housewives would not get tired. Hoosier cabinets
                         also introduced color into the kitchen, making it a more attractive
                         place.</p>

                    <p>The limitations of Hiller&apos;s research materials somewhat undermine her
                         aim to provide readers with the broader context of kitchen history. She
                         uses Ellen Plante&apos;s excellent book <hi rend="i">The American Kitchen,
                              1700 to the Present</hi> (1995) for the general history of kitchen
                         development, but depends too heavily on the manufacturers&apos; own
                         records for evidence of the cabinet&apos;s popularity. Other kinds of
                         evidence that an historian might have looked at seem to be missing here:
                         census information might have supported a more nuanced interpretation of
                         class; evidence for sales might have told us how many households chose a
                         Hoosier cabinet over built-in shelves and pantries. The book has almost no
                         floor plans and so the claim that Hoosier cabinets saved steps is
                         under-supported when we cannot see where the other appliances in the
                         kitchen were located nor where the family ate their meals. The book is
                         likely to appeal to collectors or owners of Hoosier cabinets who want to
                         know more about them, but is too broad-brush to appeal to historians.</p>

                         Native American cultures flourished and transformed over time from small,
                         egalitarian groups of hunter-gatherers to sedentary farming communities
                         controlled by chiefdoms. Martha P. Otto and Brian G. Redmond&apos;s
                         edited volume with thirteen chapters focuses on a primary transition in
                         this cultural evolution from the Archaic period (ca. 8000 B.C. to 500 B.C.)
                         to the Early Woodland period (ca. 500 B.C. to A.D. 1). The major cultural
                         changes in this transition included the development of pottery,
                         horticulture, increased social organization, and earthwork construction
                         of burial mounds and circular or square enclosures. The apex of the Early
                         Woodland period has been defined as the Adena culture and was centered in
                         <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName> and neighboring states, including <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>. Unfortunately only one

                         is a good volume for readers who are interested in prehis- <pb n="105"

                         broad overviews, theoretical analysis, specific case studies, set
                         tlement patterns, and material culture research.</p>
                    <p>Many of the contributing chapters in this publication are by-products of
                         Cultural Resource Management (CRM) projects mandated by federal or state
                         agencies and funded through public tax dollars. It is nice to see these
                         investigations included in this book because they are not typically printed
                         in a public format. Instead, most CRM or &quot;gray literature&quot;
                         reports are produced in small volume and stored in government archives.
                         The reports are often very technically descriptive, lacking a strong
                         historical or scientific narrative that would engage the reader.
                         Regrettably, some of the contributing authors had difficulty in converting
                         their CRM reports into a prose style suitable for both professionals and
                         enthusiasts. Excellent exceptions include the works of Jeff Carskadden on
                         Early Woodland cultural landscape in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName>, Sean M. Rafferty on the
                         function of smoking pipes in Early Woodland burial practices, and Beth
                         McCord and Don Cochran on late Adena (Early Woodland) and early Hopewell
                         (Middle Woodland) earthworks in east-central <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>.</p>
                    <p>McCord and Cochran summarize their research, ongoing since the 1980s, to
                         define both regional and intra-site temporal sequences of Adena and
                         Hopewell earthwork complexes in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>. Their work resulted in the
                         identification of approximately 100 earthworks, but only 12 have been
                         investigated archaeologically, including the Anderson complex,
                         preserved as Mound State Park near <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013300" reg="Anderson">Anderson</settlement></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>. The authors, going
                         against the grain of traditional interpretations, argue that late Adena and
                         early Hopewell earthworks are much more complex than previously thought
                         and that they coevolved (rather than the former evolving into the latter).
                         They also argue that each earthwork complex was a &quot;corporate&quot;
                         center for social, political, and ritual ceremonies that are connected to
                         local cultural identities (p. 357). Interestingly, associated habitation
                         or village sites have been mostly elusive and are still a mystery for
                         future research to solve.</p>
                    <p>The goal of Otto and Redmond&apos;s volume was to present current research on
                         the cultural transition in the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName> country from the Archaic period to the
                         Woodland period, but this objective was only partially accomplished. Of the
                         thirteen chapters, ten focus on the Early Woodland/Adena culture and
                         only three highlight the Archaic period. I would recommend <hi rend="i"

                         companion text. Together, the two books provide a complete study of
                         cultural transition between these major periods. A final limitation of this
                         volume is the lack of a subject index, which needs to be added to any
                         future revisions and/or editions.</p>

                         soaring rhetoric have made the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">U.S.</country></placeName> Congress a showplace for those who
                         would understand the legislative process. State legislatures, bounded by
                         parochial interests and distended by sheer numbers, are poor relations.
                         Yet, more than one hundred years after James Bryce&apos;s comment that
                         &quot;American publicists...have been too much absorbed in the study of the
                         federal system to bestow much thought on the state governments,&quot; these
                         &quot;halls of the people&quot; continue to touch the lives of ordinary
                         citizens and provide a testing ground for national policy.</p>

                         the state legislature. The book is at once a remarkably thorough analysis
                         of legislative process and a compilation of historical anecdote, written
                         in straight-forward prose. Gold, an attorney for <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName>&apos;s Legislative
                         Service Commission, is in a particularly favored position to offer
                         insight into both the professional processes as well as the personal
                         idiosyncrasies of lawmaking.</p>
                    <p>The book, commissioned largely to coincide with <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName>&apos;s bicentennial,
                         encompasses the vast majority of its material in parts entitled &quot;The
                         First Century&quot; and &quot;The Second Century.&quot; Short, but
                         essential sections on &quot;Background&quot; and &quot;The Third Cen
                         tury&quot; provide a contextual frame-work. The narrative changes from a
                         purely chronological format in the first chapter to a more thematic one by
                         the second, yet given the comprehensive nature of this book, Gold has
                         followed the only logical path.</p>
                    <p>In the body of the work, the reader will be acquainted with the policy,
                         procedure, and structure of the General Assembly. Complementary chap
                         ters in the two major sections allow for comparisons. Thus, chapter six
                         (&quot;The Rules of Play&quot;) follows the course of bills from
                         introduction to committee work in the early nineteenth century, while
                         chapter sixteen (&quot;Glasnost and Perestroika&quot;) does the same for
                         the twentieth.</p>
                    <p>Gold performs a decided service in examining the growing and chang- <pb
                              n="108" id="VAA4025-106-1-116"/> ing infrastructure of the General
                         Assembly, making sense of a sometimes labyrinthine system that spawned
                         stenographers, pages, clerks, and porters. Professionalization of the
                         legislature is a recurring theme, as twentieth-century reformers created a
                         reference department and bill drafting services.</p>
                    <p>The book does not ignore the personality of the legislature, and here, in
                         fact, one can find the book&apos;s most memorable passages. Anecdotal
                         accounts of the rituals of the General Assembly (e.g., seating of
                         members, opening prayers, end of session antics) provide a flexible
                         framework for the more clinical analyses of policy and procedure (e.g.,
                         apportionment, rural-urban voting). Gold introduces us to the men and women
                         who made this body work, sometimes in spite of themselves. From Vern Riffe,
                         the powerful, efficiency-minded Speaker of the House from 1975 to 1994 to
                         Gus Kasch, a &quot;perpetual rebellion expert&quot; who &quot;finally left
                         his fellow lawmakers in peace when he died in 1946,&quot; the author&apos;s
                         selective use of individuals as illustrative of larger institutional trends
                         is masterful.</p>
                    <p>A handful of mistakes should have been caught by a sharp editor. The author
                         denies that Jacob Cox, governor from 1866 to 1868, served in Congress. Cox
                         actually had a turn representing Ohio&apos;s Sixth District from 1877 to
                         1879. A brief citation to &quot;Democratic governor Myers Y. Cooper&quot;
                         belies the fact that this governor was a Republican.</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, Gold has produced as close to a comprehensive look at these
                         &quot;institutions of democracy&quot; as is possible. Intensely readable,
                         interspersing a wide-ranging synthesis (part-time rough-and-tumble body
                         to full-time, professional institution) with highly specific anecdotes, <hi

                    <p><hi rend="i">Our Lincoln</hi> is a collection of eleven essays viewing
                         Lincoln in the historical context of his times. The essays, written by
                         leading scholars of Lincoln and the nineteenth century, demonstrate that
                         there remain fascinating areas for inquiry into the life of this complex
                         American icon. In the introduction, Eric Foner identifies the theme that
                         links all the essays to Lin- <pb n="109" id="VAA4025-106-1-117"/>
                         coin&apos;s contemporary environment. Each author seeks to explain an
                         aspect of the &quot;complex interrelationship between the man and the
                         times in which he lived&quot; (p. 11). It should be expected in an essay
                         collection that some will have a stronger connection to the general theme
                         than others, but all the essayists have made an effort to tie their
                         respective subjects to the world that surrounded Lincoln.</p>
                    <p>The essays by James McPherson and Mark Neely provide a synthesis, with some
                         new perspectives, of their larger book-length treatments of Lincoln as
                         commander in chief and Lincoln&apos;s use of presidential power. In
                         another essay, Sean Wilentz proposes that Lincoln accepted many of the
                         political ideas of the Jacksonian Democrats. Lincoln&apos;s commitment to a
                         strong central government reflects, according to Wilentz, the nationalis
                         tic views of both Jackson and Lincoln. The idea that Lincoln would abandon
                         his strong Whiggish opinions may seem a bit of a stretch, but Wilentz does
                         place Lincoln in the political environment of the first half of the
                         nineteenth century, and from that perspective the essay is
                         worthwhile.</p>
                    <p>Lincoln&apos;s family is the subject of Catherine Clinton&apos;s essay.
                         Clinton provides a straightforward narrative describing the generally
                         accepted story of the Lincoln family relationships and shows Lincoln in
                         the traditional nineteenth-century domestic environment. Two other essays
                         by Andrew Delbanco and Richard Carwardine also emphasize the personal
                         side of Lincoln. Carwardine&apos;s thorough analysis of Lincoln&apos;s
                         religion provides an insightful and valuable interpretation of
                         Lincoln&apos;s spirituality. A number of books, including Douglas
                         Wilson&apos;s <hi rend="i">Lincoln&apos;s Sword</hi> (2006), have examined
                         Lincoln&apos;s use of language, but Delbanco takes a different look,
                         emphasizing the sacramental content.</p>
                    <p>Eric Foner&apos;s essay is a careful examination of the African colo
                         nization movement and Lincoln&apos;s engagement with this widely accepted
                         nineteenth-century solution to <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country></placeName>&apos;s racial dilemma. James Oakes
                         also addresses the racial tensions that confronted both Lincoln and the
                         nation when he discusses states&apos; rights and the rights of
                         citizens.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="i">Our Lincoln</hi> contains a collection of worthwhile essays that
                         enrich our understanding of Lincoln&apos;s relationship to the world in
                         which he lived and the people he influenced. Lincoln&apos;s character was
                         certainly influenced by the social fabric of the early and mid-nineteenth
                         century. These essays contribute to our understanding of the atmosphere
                         and the political and social institutions of the period. <hi rend="i">Our

                    <p>This is a modest, clearly written, and successful book, with a somewhat mis
                         leading title, but many wonderful photographs. The goal of the book is to
                         reveal how <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007253" reg="Iowa">Iowa</region></placeName> farmers adapted to the post-World War II revolution in
                         agricultural productivity, a revolution largely tied to new chemicals and
                         new machines. Based on survey and census data, and interviews with
                         farmers, Anderson provides a terse, brief survey of how new fertilizers,
                         insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and new harvesting machines more
                         than doubled the output of corn, soybeans, small grains, and hay. He also
                         traces the early impact of growth-inducing antibiotics and hormones on
                         livestock production (poultry excluded). He describes the very gradual
                         shift to extremely large confinement facilities (factories) for hogs and
                         huge feed lots for beef cattle, with the attendant problems of manure
                         disposal. His focus is on the individual farmers -- on the hard choices
                         they had to make to remain competitive and, at the same time, to adjust to
                         an increasing array of environmental regulations. Over half of the farmers
                         did not compete successfully, and left agriculture. Anderson does not
                         survey the fate of these displaced farmers, or describe the role of federal
                         agricultural policies in making possible, or even in some cases, forcing
                         such a revolution.</p>


                    <p>Contrary to what one might have expected, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007253" reg="Iowa">Iowa</region></placeName> farmers rarely led the way in
                         many of these shifts. They were very cautious in adopting new chemicals or
                         expensive new machines. In the case of increased fertilizer use,
                         particularly nitrogen fertilizers, they lagged behind farmers in most
                         neighboring states, perhaps because they were still enjoying the wealth of
                         plant nutrients stored up in the state&apos;s long-grass prairies. In con
                         finement dairy farming, they lagged far behind <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007157" reg="California">California</region></placeName>, and in hog fac
                         tories behind <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007709" reg="North Carolina">North Carolina</region></placeName>. But by 1972 -- the rather arbitrary end point
                         of this book -- scientifically informed, mechanized, and chemically sup
                         ported agriculture was victorious in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007253" reg="Iowa">Iowa</region></placeName>.</p>
                    <p>The care with which Anderson adheres to his inclusive dates will frustrate
                         many readers. At times one needs more understanding of pre- 1945
                         agricultural innovations and policies. About half of his stories of
                         innovation abruptly close down in 1972, before the most significant peri
                         ods of adaptation or controversy, as in the case of new environmental con
                         straints. Anderson&apos;s account seems at times to be the first half of an
                         ongoing story. Only in a final paragraph does he mention organic farmers
                         and thus hint at another untold story -- the considerable number of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007253" reg="Iowa">Iowa</region></placeName>
                         farmers <pb n="111" id="VAA4025-106-1-119"/> who rejected the new
                         industrialized agriculture, and who joined various organizations to support
                         a sustainable type of farming. Finally, in his focus upon farmers on the
                         ground, Anderson has to assume a good bit of background knowledge about
                         the politics of farming and the crucial role of governmental polices
                         (rarely noting, for example, the role of government subsidies). Despite
                         these caveats, this is a well-researched and informative book.</p>

                              American Agriculture since 1929</hi><lb/> By Paul K. Conkin<lb/>

                    <p>The history of twentieth-century American agriculture is the story of rapid
                         technological and scientific change, bountiful production, and farm
                         population decline. It also is the story of changing agricultural policy,
                         labor problems, and racism. It is a complicated story of the interaction of
                         rural men, women, and children whose lives often were influenced by
                         national and international developments beyond their control and
                         knowledge. In this study, Paul Conkin emphasizes the transformation of
                         agriculture since the onset of the Great Depression by stressing tech
                         nological change and federal agricultural policy. He also reflects about
                         his childhood on a farm in east <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007825" reg="Tennessee">Tennessee</region></placeName> and ventures into the
                         twenty-first century regarding policy matters related to the environment
                         and public health.</p>
                    <p>Conkin provides a good survey of technological change. He correctly
                         contends that the gasoline-powered tractor became the most important
                         hardware technology on a national scale, but does not give enough emphasis
                         to the significance of the mechanical cotton picker as the major regional
                         technology, given its unintended consequences. Conkin provides an excellent
                         analysis of agricultural policy beginning with the presidential
                         administration of Herbert Hoover. His survey of New Deal agricultural
                         policy is succinct, clear, and informative. Occasionally, additional
                         information would clarify discussions of policy matters, for example, the
                         importance of non-recourse loans for maintaining farm income and reducing
                         risk in production. Conkin&apos;s discussion of the chemical revolution
                         is thorough, his analysis of its effects on public health timely, and his
                         survey of sustainable agriculture and organic farming useful.</p>

                    <p>The author&apos;s most significant contribution, however, is his personal
                         reflection about farm life in east <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007825" reg="Tennessee">Tennessee</region></placeName> and <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007710" reg="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</region></placeName>. Here, Conkin
                         cogently describes agricultural life with particular attention to changes
                         wrought by the world beyond farmyard and fields. Conkin writes about lost
                         American country life -- the necessity for farm women to establish
                         reputations with local merchants as makers of high-quality butter, the way
                         to determine whether hens remain productive layers or merit the chopping
                         block, the memory of early spring as farm families&apos;
                         &quot;hungry&quot; time when cellars ran low of preserved fruits and
                         vegetables, and the hardscrabble need to pick wild fruits and nuts to help
                         meet family food needs. He discusses the life-altering importance of
                         electrification, which made hot water and indoor toilets a farm reality
                         and which brought a new and enduring term into rural households -- the
                         light bill. He contrasts the farming in east <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007825" reg="Tennessee">Tennessee</region></placeName> with that
                         practiced by his sister and brother-in-law in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007710" reg="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</region></placeName> and shows that
                         farm problems are common across regions and that differences often are
                         merely matters of scale.</p>


                    <p>Conkin does not survey American agricultural history in a national context
                         other than to discuss technology and policy, which necessarily limited
                         his research base, and historians will find the notes rather thin. Still,
                         he tells a great deal by using numbers, without losing the reader in
                         minutia or deadly prose. Conkin is not particularly sympathetic to farm
                         ers who lost their land during the 1980s farm crisis, but he sees the agri
                         cultural policy of the twenty-first century clearly linked to the
                         Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, contrary to the opinion of some
                         younger social scientists writing about contemporary farm policy. Overall,
                         this study merits the attention of anyone interested in American
                         agricultural history as well as those who should deal with contemporary
                         scientific, environmental, and agricultural issues in <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">U.S.</country></placeName> history

                         small African American population -- nearly seven percent in 1960 (p. 3) --
                         retained voting rights even after black residents of other southern states
                         were disfranchised; but <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region></placeName>&apos;s segregated economy and Jim Crow
                         laws evidenced an environment of racial oppression and prejudice that
                         limited African American opportunities and necessitated the fight against
                         discrimination and exclusion. The stories of activism compiled in <hi
                              rend="i">Freedom on the Border</hi> reveal the variability of
                         discriminatory practices in towns and cities across the state,
                         highlighting the ways that location shaped the strategies, agendas, and
                         outcomes of local struggles and reminding readers of the array of campaigns
                         subsumed within the larger civil rights movement.</p>
                    <p>The interviews in this publication come from the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region></placeName> Civil Rights Oral
                         History Project, an initiative of the state&apos;s Oral History Com
                         mission (KOHC). Starting in 1998, the KOHC conducted interviews with civil
                         rights activists and identified interviews already in archival collec
                         tions that related to the topic. The commission sought to document the
                         breadth of the movement, and the interviews edited for this book include
                         those of elected officials, organizational leaders and foot soldiers;
                         black and white women and men; those who joined campaigns as children and
                         students and those who work for universities and state government.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="i">Freedom on the Border</hi> is well organized, with thematic
                         chapters focused on desegregation of public accommodations, schools,
                         housing, political representation, jobs, and cultural expression. Each
                         chapter opens with a contextual essay before presenting approximately two
                         dozen interview excerpts, ranging from one paragraph to two pages in
                         length. Brief biographies of the narrators appear later in the book. The
                         format allows many voices and perspectives to be included and provides
                         corroboration and comparison, but the brevity of excerpts often makes it
                         hard to get a handle on specifics of campaigns or to assess the impact on
                         individuals. Many of the stories seem strangely impersonal as a result,
                         devoid of personal reflections. Five longer narratives interspersed
                         throughout the book, by contrast, allow for the telling of fuller stories
                         that illuminate how activists now <pb n="114" id="VAA4025-106-1-122"/>
                         understand their choices and motivations, thereby linking the personal
                         and the political, as well as the past and the present.</p>
                    <p>A strong conclusion anchors the book, synthesizing the interviews and pulling
                         divergent stories into a larger whole. This conclusion offers valuable
                         insights into the construction of activists&apos; memories and the
                         relationship of individual memories to a larger narrative of the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">U.S.</country></placeName>
                         civil rights movement. Contrasting <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region></placeName> stories with those from the
                         Deep South, <hi rend="i">Freedom on the Border</hi> notes the distinct form
                         of the movement in the Blue Grass state, including the relatively minor
                         role of the church and of black political organizations. &quot; [W]hat is
                         striking,&quot; the editors write, &quot;is the extent to which stories
                         focus on the individual&apos;s actions without associating them with a
                         larger movement,&quot; an observation worth considering in other
                         contexts (p. 255).</p>
                    <p><hi rend="i">Freedom on the Border</hi> succeeds in calling renewed attention
                         to the influence of location on understandings of civil rights activism,
                         however, the geographical focus also becomes the book&apos;s weakness.
                         Given the very local nature of many of the campaigns described in the book
                         and the variety of tactics and organizational structures employed, the
                         relevance of a statewide examination of the movement becomes unclear. It
                         is hard to know what unites these narratives, other than their common
                         origin in an oral history project. Still, the book offers important
                         evidence that race-based discrimination was not limited to the Deep South
                         and neither were campaigns for social change. Reminding readers that the
                         civil rights movement was neither unified nor homogenous, <hi rend="i"
                              >Freedom on the Border</hi> presents a strong challenge to prevalent
                         narratives of the black freedom movement.</p>

                    <p>These books have some common origins and themes, and a shared focus on
                         presenting the voices, personal stories, and observations of contemporary
                         Native Americans. Their connecting thread is the work of Rita Kohn, an
                         adjunct professor of Journalism at Indiana University- Purdue
                         University, <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>, who became deeply involved in these projects in
                         the early 1990s. Numerous other people collaborated and supported what
                         was clearly a labor of love to make these volumes possible.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="i">Always a People</hi> first appeared in 1997 and was reprinted in
                         2008 to appear in tandem with <hi rend="i">Long Journey Home</hi>, which is
                         discussed below. Its oral histories, recorded in the 1990s, reflect the
                         thoughts and life experiences of forty individuals, largely (but not
                         exclusively) of Algonquian heritage and with northeastern and mid
                         western tribal roots. They range in length from a few to a dozen pages
                         (surely many of the originals were longer; editing has tidied and focused
                         these texts to an extent that is rather hard to gauge). The voices come
                         from members of eleven Woodland nations. More than half of those inter
                         viewed are from <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007707" reg="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</region></placeName>, and their diversity reflects the diversity of
                         Indi an peoples removed at various times to that &quot;Indian
                         Territory&quot;: Delaware, Miami, Ottawa, Peoria, Sauk/Fox, Shawnee. Five
                         Potawatomis are represented, all <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007520" reg="Michigan">Michigan</region></placeName>-based. The Delaware people
                         exhibit the widest dispersal, seven being based in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007707" reg="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</region></placeName>, and three in
                         <placeName><region type="province" key="tgn_7013154" reg="Ontario">Ontario</region></placeName>, <placeName><country key="tgn_7005685" reg="Canada">Canada</country></placeName>. The range is completed by two Chippewas (<placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007922" reg="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</region></placeName>), one

Several speakers are of
                         mixed ancestry, both Native and non- Native, but identify through kin ties
                         and community and cultural experi ence with a particular tribal group.</p>
                    <p>The texts appear in alphabetical order by surname, with tribal identities
                         supplied in individual entries. This choice lends support to the gen
                         eralized concept of &quot;Woodland Nations&quot; advanced in the preface,
                         but also means that readers interested in retrieving, say, the Delawares or
                         Potawatomis as a group have to search for them. Given that tribal
                         identities have clearly remained <pb n="116" id="VAA4025-106-1-124"/>
                         important to the individuals involved, grouping them under those headings
                         would have been helpful for people interested in tracing distinctiveness
                         and enduring significance. But one thrust of the book is to highlight com
                         monalities, and in that it succeeds. Commentaries about childhood,
                         experiences of racism, language loss, survival, the importance of grand
                         parents and other kin, and success in various occupations and Native lead
                         ership roles echo time and again through these verbal self-portraits. As
                         for portraits, a remarkable feature of the book is its reproduction in
                         color of the fine oil portraits, done by Evelyn J. Ritter, of almost all
                         of the speakers. Overall, the book provides a rich overview of Woodland
                         Indian leaders and thinkers reflecting on their personal histories,
                         lives, and situations in a decade in which their families&apos; and
                         communities&apos; trials and losses across the centuries culminated in the
                         revival of identity and pride at the end of the twentieth century.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="i">LongJourney Home</hi> came about as readers of the first volume
                         became aware of how much Delaware history was based in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>. The
                         editors and others worked over four years to gather interviews with the
                         descen- dants of the White River (<placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>) Delawares whose homeland had

                         torical context. The book opens with a short introduction, &quot;Historical
                         Information about the Lenape,&quot; by Deborah Nichols-Ledermann and James
                         A. Rementer; it briefly but vividly portrays how a people once based in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007565" reg="New Jersey">New Jersey</region></placeName> and parts of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007568" reg="New York">New York</region></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007710" reg="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</region></placeName>, and <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007239" reg="Delaware">Delaware</region></placeName> became so widely
                         dispersed across areas ranging from <placeName><region type="province" key="tgn_7013154" reg="Ontario">Ontario</region></placeName> to <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007707" reg="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</region></placeName>. Part 1 brings
                         forward older Delaware voices with <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> roots by means of printing ten
                         interview transcripts recorded in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007707" reg="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</region></placeName> in 1937-38 under a Works
                         Progress Administration writers&apos; project grant. Part 2 presents three
                         edited interviews conducted in 1968 by Katherine Red Corn. Part 3
                         contributes two further interviews done in 1995, and Part 4 offers
                         thirty-one &quot;Contemporary Interviews&quot; done for this project.</p>
                    <p>The book closes with an <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> focus, offering a &quot;Roundtable Dis
                         cussion on the Lenape Program at Conner Prairie Living Museum, <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031804" reg="Fishers">Fishers</settlement></placeName>,
                         <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>,&quot; in which those involved with the museum reflect on the con
                         tent and significance of the museum&apos;s Delaware educational and
                         cultural work with schoolchildren and the general public. Their
                         contribution builds on the fact that several of the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007707" reg="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</region></placeName> Delawares
                         interviewed in the book refer to the museum, having visited it to help in
                         the programming and rebuild historical connections, and for their own
                         interest. Another public offering related to this book should be
                         mentioned; in 2003, a video documentary entitled <hi rend="i">Long Journey
                              Home</hi> was created and shown widely on public television.</p>
                    <p>These two books, taken together, fulfill their goals very well and <pb

                         ences and views of current generations of Native Americans from the
                         Midwest to <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007707" reg="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</region></placeName>. <hi rend="i">Long Joumrney Home</hi>, with its
                         sharpened focus on Delaware people, moves beyond the construct of
                         &quot;Woodland Nations&quot; to show that while Delawares have inter
                         married widely with others and are kin to many, a distinct tribal identity
                         endures at the core of people&apos;s lives, through a strong historical
                         sense and cultural awareness transmitted through families from ancestors
                         and grandparents, and often retrieved through renewed community bonds that
                         may reach across long distances. The editors say that their intent
                         throughout &quot;has been to bring honor to all indigenous people while
                         enabling one group to emerge as a multi-dimensional, multi-facted soci
                         ety&quot; (p. xvii). Similar volumes might well be done for each of the
                         other &quot;Woodland Nations&quot; whose voices speak in <hi rend="i"
