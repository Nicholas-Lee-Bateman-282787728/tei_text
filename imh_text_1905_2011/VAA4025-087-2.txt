            Moral Choices: Two Indiana Quaker Communities and the Abolitionist Movement

            In the last public utterance of his life, John C. Calhoun told the nation that it was held together
                    by cords of union, cords that were being severed one by one by the rise of the abolitionist movement
                    in the North. One of these cords was religious, straining as the great national
                    denominations—Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist—developed sectional fissures or
                    split, North versus South. These divisions would have a profound impact on the future of American
                    Protestantism, with consequences even to this day.1
            
            Such divisiveness was not limited to the "mainline" denominations, nor did it occur
                    solely along sectional lines. The movement for immediate, unconditional abolition of slavery also
                    splintered churches in the North. Many denominations looked on the immediate abolition movement that
                    rose in the early 1830s as dangerous and heterodox, tied to deism and infidelity and challenging
                    both Scriptural Christianity and the peace of the churches. Abolitionists responded with
                    "come-outer" movements in which they sought to free themselves of ties with
                    spurious Christians implicated in the sin of slavery. Thus new denominations were born.2

            Surprisingly, among the groups that found themselves embroiled in controversy in the 1830s and 1840s
                    was the Society of Friends, or Quakers. Friends were no strangers to theological dispute; they had
                    split into Hicksite and Orthodox factions in a bitter confrontation in the 1820s, and in the 1840s
                    new divisions were brewing. But unlike many other denominations, Quakerism had a long antislavery
                    heritage that had put it in the vanguard of the abolitionist movement. By 1784, the various yearly
                    meetings of Friends in the 
                        United States
                     had ruled that no member could own slaves and that those who were slaveowners were to
                    give slaves their freedom. Some Quakers chose to leave the society rather than embrace emancipation,
                    but most submitted to the demand for manumission. Not a few Indiana Quakers in the 1840s were
                    children or grandchildren of former slaveholders. Thus, Indiana Friends should have been spared
                    contention on the subject.3
            
            That, however, was not to be the case. The antislavery movement in the 
                        United States
                     and Great Britain took a new turn in the late 1820s and early 1830s, culminating in the
                    formation of the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1833. The keynotes of the new movement were the
                    insistence that slaveholding was a sin and the call for its end through immediate emancipation. This
                    position set abolitionists apart from earlier antislavery efforts, including Quaker ones, which had
                    called for gradual emancipation, often linked to the forced colonization of freed slaves overseas.
                    Abolitionism was also distinguished by its missionary zeal for organizing auxiliaries and flooding
                    the country with antislavery literature. By striking at the "cords of union," it
                    encountered ferocious opposition, both in the North and South. The Quaker attitude toward the new
                    abolitionist movement was complex. Some Friends, to be sure, embraced it; about a third of the
                    founding members of the American

                            Some explanation is necessary about the organizational structure and components of the
                                Society of Friends in the nineteenth century: (1) The lowest rung on the Quaker
                                organizational ladder was the indulged or preparative meeting, often referred to simply
                                as a meeting. It can best be thought of as an individual congregation. One or more
                                meetings made up a (2) monthly meeting, which was the basic unit of Quaker organization.
                                It had the power to receive and disown members, to hold property, and to solemnize
                                marriages. Two or more monthly meetings made up a (3) quarterly meeting. The quarterly
                                meeting dealt with problems—usually of doctrine and
                                organization—deemed too important to be left to monthly meetings. Finally,
                                several quarterly meetings made up a (4) yearly meeting. Until 1902, the yearly meeting
                                was the ultimate authority for all Orthodox Friends living within its bounds. It made
                                decisions on both doctrine and discipline and served as a court of final appeal. Each
                                yearly meeting was independent of all others, but the Orthodox yearly meetings were tied
                                closely together by an intricate system of correspondence. See Thomas D. Hamm, The Transformation of American Quakerism: Orthodox Friends,
                                    1800–1907 (
                                    Bloomington
                                , 1988), xvi.
                        
               
                     Anti-Slavery Society were Quakers, and Friends such as John
                    Greenleaf Whittier, Abby Kelley, and Sarah and Angelina Grimke were among the new
                    movement's best-known proponents. But such men and women were exceptional, even among
                    Quakers. As Thomas E. Drake noted a generation ago, the few vocal and radical abolitionists among
                    Friends in the East soon found themselves isolated and, in some cases, purged.4
            
            Indiana, however, seemed to offer hope to abolitionists. By the late 1830s, Indiana Yearly Meeting of
                    Orthodox Friends was one of the largest in the world, growing steadily through migration, especially
                    from 
                        North Carolina
                    . Indiana Quakers had formed a solid phalanx to keep slavery out of the state, and they
                    had vigorously protested against enactment of the notoriously racist Indiana Black Laws in 1831. In
                    1836 the yearly meeting had warned its members against joining any association that advocated
                    colonization, which the yearly meeting condemned as "the unrighteous work of
                    expatriation." In the same year and in 1837, it issued statements that hailed the growth of
                    "a lively sense of the iniquity and horrors of Slavery." At the same time,
                    however, it cautioned against joining "with others not of our society," lest the
                    standing of Friends as a "peculiar people," separate from "the
                    world," be compromised.5
            
            In 1839 the situation in Indiana changed dramatically. The catalyst was the arrival of Arnold Buffum,
                    who came from 
                        New England
                     as the duly accredited agent of the American Anti-Slavery Society. A state antislavery
                    society had been formed in Indiana a year earlier but had made slow progress, and Buffum was charged
                    with organizing new affiliates in the state. Buffum targeted the Quaker communities of east-central
                    Indiana, especially those in 
                        Wayne
                    , 
                        Union
                    , 
                        Randolph

                        Henry
                    , and 
                        Grant
                     counties. He established his headquarters in 
                        Newport
                     (now 
                        Fountain City
                    ) in 
                        Wayne County
                    , where he edited an abolitionist journal, the Protectionist, and from
                    which he periodically mounted lecture and organizing tours. Buffum won many converts, and soon

                            instead of the "pagan" names for the days of the week and the months of
                            the year.
               
                     appeared in all of the counties in which he labored. Other
                    Friends, however, looked on him with fear and mistrust. Buffum, after all, had been a Friend but had
                    been disowned (the Quaker term for excommunicated) in the East and had come west pursued by letters
                    and traveling Quaker ministers warning against him as an infidel and deceiver.6
            
            Buffum's success created fears at the highest level of Indiana Yearly Meeting. In 1840 the
                    Meeting for Sufferings, the yearly meeting's equivalent of an executive committee, issued a
                    statement condemning membership in antislavery societies, and a year later it advised that local
                    meetinghouses be closed to antislavery gatherings. In the fall of 1842, it took the final step of
                    removing from the Meeting for Sufferings eight members with abolitionist sympathies and ordered that
                    no one who identified himself or herself as an abolitionist could hold any position of
                    responsibility in the society. Thus repudiated and in their own minds driven beyond endurance, the
                    abolitionist Friends separated to form the Indiana Yearly Meeting of Anti-Slavery Friends.
                    Ultimately perhaps two thousand people, or about a tenth of the yearly meeting's
                    membership, separated.7
            
            While the events of the separation are not in dispute, its causes are. At the time, there was no lack
                    of explanations. Anti-Slavery Friends saw themselves upholding traditional Quaker testimony against
                    slavery, while their opponents had abandoned it. Their opponents, meanwhile, fond of
                    non-Friends' applause, prosperous because of economic ties with the South, and committed to
                    the Whig party (Henry Clay himself had been in 
                        Richmond
                    , Indiana, where the yearly meeting was held, on the very day that the abolitionists
                    were purged from the Meeting for Sufferings and had been warmly received by leading Friends), looked
                    on abolition "as calculated to deprive them of the means of amassing wealth."
                    "Body" Friends, as conservative opponents of abolition became known, responded
                    that Anti-Slavery Friends were abandoning Quaker tradition to ally themselves with non-Friends, many
                    of whom were infidels leading notoriously immoral lives, thus endangering traditions of peculiarity
                    and separation from the world that characterized true Quakers. Abolition, with its mob scenes,

                     placed Friends in situations in which they might violate the
                    peace testimony. Finally, by ignoring the advice of the yearly meeting and then complaining and
                    protesting when it removed them from important posts because of their actions, the abolitionists
                    showed a regard for self and a contempt for the yearly meeting that was incompatible with the
                    humility characteristic of solid Friends.8
            
            Subsequent scholarly analysis has not advanced much farther. No historian has accepted the argument
                    of Anti-Slavery Friends that the "Body" was indifferent to slavery. Separatists
                    were able to point to the statements of a few individual Friends who supported colonization or
                    questioned aiding fugitive slaves, but these were positions that the "Body"
                    continued to condemn. The old yearly meeting, moreover, opposed the annexation of 
                        Texas
                    , continued to protest the legalized racism of Indiana law, and expanded its efforts to
                    aid free blacks. Instead, two lines of historical analysis have emerged. One, set forth most fully
                    by Ruth Anna Ketring in her 1937 biography of Charles Osborn, elder statesman and minister of
                    Anti-Slavery Friends, argued that the separation was a split between conservative Quakers who
                    "considered it little short of criminal for Friends to associate with
                    ‘worldly’ people," and progressives, "who saw no objection
                    to mingling with other people." The implication clearly was that Anti-Slavery Friends were
                    more open to outside influences. The other theory was advanced by Drake in his 1950 monograph, Quakers and Slavery in America. Drake emphasized social and economic factors;
                    because Indiana Yearly Meeting was the "melting pot" of American Quakerism, the
                    split was the result of the wide gulf between democratic, radical abolitionist Friends in the
                    countryside and the more conservative Quakers of the towns and cities, with their economic ties to
                    the South. Subsequent accounts have generally accepted these analyses.9.
            Both historical interpretations, however, have their problems. Ketring's
                    "pro-outsider"—"anti-outsider" dichotomy runs aground
                    on facts pointed out by Anti-Slavery Friends at the time; the "Body" might condemn
                    "mixed" antislavery societies, but many of

                     its stalwarts were involved in comparable temperance,
                    education, and moral reform groups, not to mention political parties and business enterprises.
                    Theologically, it is easier to find clear signs of outside influences, mostly evangelical, in the
                    religious thought of anti-abolitionists such as Elijah Coffin, the clerk of the yearly meeting, and
                    Jeremiah Hubbard, its leading minister, than among Anti-Slavery Friends such as Osborn, who was
                    adamantly opposed to all doctrinal innovation. As for the second interpretation, economic
                    differences may have played a role, but a town versus countryside explanation of the split faces the
                    reality that nearly all Indiana Quakers in this period were rural. Indeed, although Indiana Yearly
                    Meeting's bounds in 1842 stretched from the vicinity of Mansfield, 
                        Ohio
                    , west to 
                        Iowa
                    , there were only three meetings in any town with a population over one thousand.10
            
            There is, however, another model for analyzing the split using the techniques of quantitative
                    history: identifying the individuals on either side, looking at their characteristics, and learning
                    what they had in common. This model has been used extensively with considerable success for one
                    previous split, the Hicksite separation of 1827–1828, and to a lesser extent to identify
                    characteristics of Friends in other periods. Utilizing this technique will not only offer more
                    understanding of Quaker history, it will also help shed much-needed light on a neglected
                    subject—the failure of the organized antislavery movement in Indiana. In the words of one
                    contemporary, Indiana was a "hard place" for antislavery, Racism was firmly
                    embedded in state laws and in the attitudes of most Hoosiers. Organized abolition had come later to
                    Indiana than to almost any other northern state, and the historical consensus is that it was weaker
                    here than in any other free state. Both Whigs and Democrats condemned it, and it was popular sport
                    to break up antislavery meetings with rocks and rotten eggs. Before 1848, one editor claimed, the
                    abolitionist movement in Indiana was dominated largely by Wayne and 
                        Henry County
                     Quakers. When these Friends split over the movement, it was even further weakened.11

            Ultimately, the decisions that Hoosier Quakers made are best explained not in terms of social and
                    economic factors—wealth, occupation, former residence—but in less tangible
                    terms of religious commitment and moral choice. Such conclusions are based on analysis of the
                    separation in two Quaker communities in 
                        Henry County
                    , 
                        Duck Creek

                        Spiceland
                     monthly meetings. Both were typical of Indiana Quakerism in the 1840s. 
                        Duck Creek
                    's boundaries were extensive, taking in Quakers in 
                        Greensboro
                    , 
                        Harrison

                        Fall Creek
                    , and part of 
                        Wayne
                     townships, along with a few Quaker families in the eastern portions of Hancock and 
                        Madison
                     counties. 
                        Spiceland
                     was more compact, embracing most of Wayne and the western half of 
                        Franklin
                     townships, with the northern edge of 
                        Rush County
                    . The first Friends at 
                        Duck Creek
                     had settled there in 1818, while 
                        Spiceland
                     had been pioneered in 1824. 
                        Duck Creek
                     Monthly Meeting was made up of two meetings, 
                        Duck Creek
                     at the edge of the village of Greensboro and Clear Spring at the southeast corner of 
                        Harrison
                     Township. Three meetings comprised 
                        Spiceland
                     Monthly Meeting—the largest in the village of 
                        Spiceland
                    , with smaller ones to the west on Blue River at 
                        Elm Grove
                     and 
                        Raysville

            Statistically, 
                        Duck Creek
                     Monthly Meeting had a membership of 645 in October, 1842: 128 adult men, 144 adult
                    women, and 373 children or youths unmarried and under twenty-one. It represented at least 115
                    families. 
                        Spiceland
                     was slightly larger—760 members—consisting of 137 adult men, 161
                    adult women, and 462 children, comprising at least 127 families. The overwhelming majority of adults
                    in both communities, as will be seen, had roots in the South, especially in 
                        North Carolina
                    , although a minority was born in 
                        Pennsylvania
                     or 
                        New Jersey
                    . These families were mobile—the average adult had lived in at least three
                    other Quaker communities before arriving in 
                        Spiceland
                     or 
                        Duck Creek
                    ; close to half had resided for a time in 
                        Ohio
                    . Nearly all were landowners. Although occupational data are difficult to obtain, it

                     nearly all adult men were farmers, along with a few
                    craftsmen—carpenters, blacksmiths, shoemakers, and millers—who also farmed.
                    There was also a handful of shopkeepers. Only two professional men have been
                    identified—Robert Harrison, an English-born schoolmaster at 
                        Spiceland
                    , and Dr. Vierling Kersey, a physician at 
                        Raysville
                    .13
            
            Two considerations dictated the choice of these communities for study. First and foremost, material
                    from both is abundant. The records of both monthly meetings—consisting of books of
                    births, deaths, and marriages; and the minutes of the men's and women's monthly
                    meeting, with their records of business matters, removals and transfers of membership, reception and
                    disownment of members, and appointment of officers and committee members—are virtually
                    complete. Thus it was possible not only to identify virtually every Friend living in both
                    communities in 1842, but also such characteristics as age, place of birth, previous residence, time
                    of arrival in the community, family connections, appointment to offices, and relationships with the
                    meeting. Of equal significance is the 1842 tax duplicate for 
                        Henry County
                    , which includes the value of all real and personal property for each resident as well
                    as the location of landholdings, making it possible to measure wealth (or lack of it) and to plot
                    places of residence. Also of interest are the records of the 
                        Henry County
                     Female Anti-Slavery Society—the only known records of any female antislavery
                    organization in the state—which permit comparisons of rates of participation in
                    abolitionist organizations before and after the separation. Finally, there are some scattered
                    manuscript correspondence, a few comments in the diaries of visiting Friends, some hints in
                    reminiscences, and one contemporary chronicle, A History of the Separation in Indiana

                        Spiceland

                  13 Indiana Quakers did not compile precise statistics on membership until
                        the 1860s. Membership of the monthly meetings was calculated using the abstracts of records
                        (births, deaths, and marriages) and minutes of business meetings in Willard C. Heiss, ed., Abstracts of the Records of the Society of Friends in Indiana (7 vols., 
                            Indianapolis
                        , 1962–1977), IV, 153–326. These records were used to trace
                        movements, along with William Wade Hinshaw, ed., Encyclopedia of American Quaker
                            Genealogy (6 vols.,

            Both communities, moreover, were deeply involved in the split. 
                        Spiceland
                     was the home both of George Evans, assistant clerk of the yearly meeting and one of the
                    most thoughtful and articulate critics of abolitionists, and of Walter and Rebecca (Cox) Edgerton,
                    the clerks, or presiding officers, of the Anti-Slavery yearly meeting. Greensboro, the center of 
                        Duck Creek
                     Monthly Meeting, had a national reputation in the 1840s as a center of radical reform
                    activities, only "a little less notorious than 
                        Newport
                    " in 
                        Wayne County
                    , the home of Levi Coffin of Underground Railroad fame. The leader of 
                        Duck Creek
                     abolitionists, Seth Hinshaw, was in fact much more advanced in his reform views than
                    anyone in 
                        Newport
                    . The two communities also offered, however, an opportunity for comparison and contrast.
                    Although both were split, 
                        Duck Creek
                     had the reputation of being far more radical in its abolitionist views than 
                        Spiceland
                    .15
            
            Unfortunately, details about the process of the separation at 
                        Duck Creek
                     and 
                        Spiceland
                     are sketchy. It is known that when county male and female antislavery societies were
                    formed in 1841, 
                        Spiceland
                     and 
                        Duck Creek
                     Friends dominated them. The yearly meeting's pronouncements, however,
                    apparently had deleterious effects on the groups. For example, while traveling with Charles Osborn
                    in 
                        New England
                     and 
                        New York
                     in 1840, George Evans of 
                        Spiceland
                     had condemned antiabolitionist sentiment among Friends there; he is also one of the few 
                        Henry County
                     Quakers for whom historians have indisputable evidence of aiding fugitive slaves. Yet
                    when the yearly meeting in Indiana acted, he became an outspoken antiabolitionist. It is also known
                    that at least nineteen 
                        Spiceland
                     women who remained with the "Body" who previously were active in the 
                        Henry County
                     Female Anti-Slavery Society withdrew from it after 1842. It seems likely that some of
                    the future 
                        Duck Creek
                     and 
                        Spiceland
                     Anti-Slavery Friends were present at the critical yearly meeting in October, 1842,
                    since yearly meeting always drew thousands of Friends to 
                        Richmond
                     from surrounding counties, and Henry Clay's visit had further swelled the
                    number of visitors. Doubtless they witnessed firsthand the events that abolitionist Friends found so
                    offensive. After the yearly meeting, conferences of Anti-Slavery Friends were held in various
                    places, including the convention in 
                        Newport
                     in February, 1843, that officially formed Indiana Yearly Meeting of Anti-Slavery

                        Duck Creek
                    , took part. Just when these Friends formed new meetings is also unknown, since their
                    records before 1849 are lost, but it was probably in February or March of 1843, because old monthly
                    meetings did not begin disowning the separatists until September, 1843. Some Friends wavered between
                    the two groups—Nathan and Jane (Wilson) Macy and Nathan's sister Anna Macy, for
                    example, alternated meetings before finally deciding to remain with the "Body."
                    The last disownment of separatists by the "Body" did not take place until spring,
                    1845. Ultimately, forty-one adults with sixty children separated at 
                        Duck Creek
                     (15.6 percent of the total membership of the old monthly meeting, or 17.7 percent of
                    its adult membership), while at 
                        Spiceland
                     twenty-two adults with sixty-three children left (11.1 percent of the total membership,
                    or 8.3 percent of the adults). The two groups of Anti-Slavery Friends combined to form 
                        Duck Creek
                     Monthly Meeting of Anti-Slavery Friends. Those around Greensboro built a new
                    meetinghouse in the village, while those who had been members of 
                        Spiceland
                     Monthly Meeting reached an uneasy agreement with the "Body" and
                    continued to use the Elm Grove Meetinghouse.16
            
            With this knowledge and these records, the question arose: what made abolitionist Friends, those who
                    felt so strongly about the antislavery cause that they were willing to organize a new yearly meeting
                    and break venerable ties, different from those Quakers who were more conservative and stood aloof
                    from abolition? Seven variables were tested:
            (1) Economics. Two theories, mutually exclusive, offered possible explanations. The
                    first was that conservative antiabolitionists were well-to-do. These Friends, presumably involved in
                    marketing their crops through downriver trade with 
                        New Orleans
                    , would have been wary of any force that made for sectional tension. 
                  
                     16 Anti-Slavery Friends were identified from disownments by the two
                            original monthly meetings as recorded in their minutes. For the formation of the new yearly

                     And, in the nature of the upper classes throughout history,
                    they would have been fearful of any kind of radicalism. In contrast, poorer Friends, subsistence
                    farmers who did not perceive any threat to their livelihood in abolition, were more open to a force
                    that extended the traditional testimony against slavery.17
            
            Conversely, there is a growing body of historical literature suggesting just the opposite. Some
                    historians have argued that the key to reform activism was leisure. Wealth, they maintain, provided
                    the surplus to subscribe to antislavery journals and to have hired girls and hands to mind children
                    and work fields while husbands and wives went off to reform meetings. Poorer Friends, in contrast,
                    were so occupied with trying to scratch out a living that they could not spare the time (nor the
                    money) to become involved in antislavery. Thus, any significant differences in wealth and property
                    between the two sides were carefully analyzed.18
            
            (2) Residence Patterns. The tax duplicate made it possible to map the residences of
                    most of the Friends in both communities. Could it be that the separation was one that pitted
                    neighborhood against neighborhood, suggesting deeper cleavages about whose nature one can only
                    speculate?
            (3) Place of Origin. The overwhelming majority of both 
                        Spiceland
                     and 
                        Duck Creek
                     Quakers came from the South, especially from 
                        North Carolina
                    —among adults 226 of 272 at 
                        Duck Creek
                    , 208 of 298 at 
                        Spiceland
                    . There is a growing body of research on southern Quakerism suggesting that southern
                    Friends were divided in their views on slavery—that abolition was far more popular in
                    Quaker communities of the piedmont and back-country, where slaveholding was relatively rare, than
                    among Quakers of eastern 
                        North Carolina
                    , where it had been far more common among Friends. Could it be that the divisions among
                    the 
                        North Carolina
                     Friends of 
                        Spiceland
                     and 
                        Duck Creek
                     reflected cleavages that went back generations? Or could it be that the Friends from
                    eastern 
                        North Carolina
                     in the two monthly meetings were more radical in 
                  
                     17 For a contemporary exposition of this argument, see Edgerton, History of the Separation, 39. For such a conclusion by a modern historian
                            concentrating on the Northeast, see Edward V. Magdol, The Antislavery Rank and
                                File: A Social Profile of the Abolitionists' Constituency (
                                Westport
                            , Conn., 1986), 64. Magdol found that the members of antislavery societies and
                            signers of antislavery petitions "tended to be the most mobile, least propertied,
                            and most economically expectant." Ibid., 63–64, 75,
                            139–40.
                  
                     18 For one such analysis, see Kathleen Smith Kutolowski,
                            "Antimasonry Reconsidered: Social Bases of the Grassroots Party," Journal of American History, LXXXI (September, 1984), 280. The importance
                            of leisure time has been especially emphasized as an important factor in the involvement of
                            women in antebellum reform movements. See, for example, Ronald G. Walters, American Reformers, 1815–1860 (
                                New York
                            , 1978), 102–104.
               
                     their antislavery views than their neighbors in their old homes
                    and had come north for that reason?19
            
            (4) Timing of Migration. The monthly meeting minutes pinpointed when almost every
                    individual arrived in the North (as distinct from 
                        Spiceland
                     or 
                        Duck Creek
                    , since many had sojourned in 
                        Ohio
                     or other parts of Indiana before coming to 
                        Henry County
                    ); perhaps the timing of migration might help explain the split. Could it be, for
                    example, that Quakers who had only recently left the South were less open to a movement that made
                    for sectional discord, splitting them from old friends and family there, while those who had lived
                    longer in the North were more open to it? Or could it be that Friends who had arrived in the North
                    after 1830 had seen the hardening of proslavery sentiment in the South after Nat Turner's
                    Rebellion in 1831, and thus were convinced that only radical action would bring about abolition,
                    while older settlers remembered a less intransigent South and still put their faith in gradualism
                    and moderation?20
            
            (5) Age. Sociologists have long noted that the young are the most likely to be open
                    to new ideas, while conservatism tends to increase with age. Historians of antebellum reform have
                    noted as well that in the 1830s and 1840s reform was an activity of the young. Could it be that the
                    separation was one that pitted young against old?21
            
            (6) Family Ties. Any Quaker community involved intricate tangles of kinship, given
                    the large size of families and the tendency of Friends, reinforced by the requirements of the
                    Discipline, to marry only within the society.22 Could it be that family ties and
                    connections, or perhaps even family feuds, were behind the separation?
            (7) Power and Status within the Society. The final question concerned the
                    relationship of individual Friends to the meeting and to the society. Other historians examining
                    periods of stress among Quakers have discovered struggles for power, with the
                    "outs" separating from the "ins" from frustration over not being

                     22 The Discipline was, in its narrowest sense, the collection of the
                            rules, regulations, and traditions under which Friends lived. For that in force at the time
                            of the separation, see Discipline of the Society of Friends of Indiana Yearly
                                Meeting (
                                Cincinnati
                            , 1839).
               
                     allowed to hold positions of influence within the group. These
                    positions included officers such as minister (not pastoral, but rather a recognition of a gift of
                    speaking in meetings), elder (one charged with regulating the ministry), overseer (one who reported
                    violations of the Discipline to the meeting and worked with offenders to bring them to repentance),
                    and clerk (the presiding officer of a meeting for business). Could a power struggle have been the
                    case in 
                        Henry County
                    , or could it be that families who separated had long had problems with the strict code
                    of behavior required of Friends under the Discipline, and, influenced by those of other faiths,
                    wanted to liberalize the society? Thus, did the separation pit unruly Friends against the pillars of
                    the meetings, those with troubled pasts against the more observant and faithful, unlikely to
                    question established ways? To gauge this possibility, the minutes of both meetings were examined,
                    noting for each adult the number of committee appointments and offices held (a reliable indicator of
                    the influence, or weight, to use the favorite Quaker term) as well as any
                    violations of the Discipline.23
            
            What, then, divided these Friends? The examination of these seven questions suggests that, with one
                    exception, quantifiable social characteristics are not critical in explaining the separation.
            Statistics in tables 1 and 2 show that when patterns of wealth and property holding are compared, no
                    clear pattern is discernible. In 
                        Duck Creek
                     Monthly Meeting, the average wealth of Anti-Slavery families was considerably higher
                    than that of "Body" Friends—$1,509.79 to
                    $1,121.66. This average is misleading, however, because it is skewed by the wealth of two
                    men among the abolitionists—Seth Hinshaw at about $5,000 and John Swain at
                    over $7,600—who together accounted for two-thirds of all of the property owned
                    by the

                     separatists. When a distribution of the wealth of the two groups is plotted, however,
                    it shows that more "Body" Friends had wealth of over $1,000 than was
                    the case with Anti-Slavery Friends. Thus a clear pattern is difficult to discern. In 
                        Spiceland
                    , the average wealth of Anti-Slavery families was also higher than that of the
                    "Body"—$1,577.72 to $1,471.52. Plotting the
                    distribution of wealth shows that again Anti-Slavery Friends tended to be more
                    prosperous—over half possessed property worth at least $2,000, while only
                    about one-fifth of the "Body" Friends could claim the same. But there were also
                    Anti-Slavery Friends whose property holdings were minimal. Thus, an economic explanation of the
                    separation does not appear to hold true in these two communities because both sides were diverse in
                    total wealth. Prosperity may have made it possible for the families of William Macy, Walter
                    Edgerton, Seth Hinshaw, and John Swain to become

                involved in reform, but lack of it did not prevent Friends like Vierling Kersey and Isaac
                    and Charity (Willits) Pitts of Greensboro from becoming abolitionists.
            As the map shows, plotting the residences of members of the two monthly meetings revealed some
                    interesting patterns. Assuming that 
                        Spiceland
                     and Greensboro were the centers of their monthly meetings, most Anti-Slavery Friends
                    lived on the fringes. The Swains, for example, were the only Quakers in 
                        Fall Creek
                     Township, while the Wrights and the family of Solomon Cox, all separatists, accounted
                    for all but one of the Quaker families in 
                    
                        Prairie
                     Township. Among the members of 
                        Spiceland
                     Monthly Meeting, a majority of Anti-Slavery Friends lived on the western edge of the
                    monthly meeting's bounds in the vicinity of Elm Grove Meetinghouse. This might lead one to
                    think that Anti-Slavery Friends were isolated and deprived of opportunities for full participation
                    in the affairs of the society, but as will be seen later the monthly meeting minutes show this not
                    to be the case.
            One of the striking results of mapping residences is to show the tendency of Anti-Slavery Friends to
                    cluster, a tendency especially noticeable in the case of the 
                        Spiceland
                     group, where a majority lived on contiguous farms along Blue
                    River. For the most part, however, this grouping probably reflects the tendency of
                    families to settle near each other. In fact Anti-Slavery Friends on Blue River
                    consisted of three sibling pairs, all first cousins, while the clusters to the north were members of
                    the Wright and Hinshaw families.
            A consideration of the third possible explanation, place of origin, also showed some possibly
                    significant patterns. (See table 3.) One explanation suggests that older conflicts, previously
                    discussed, between coastal and piedmont Friends in 
                        North Carolina
                     may have carried over into these communities. The monthly meetings of Friends in
                    eastern 
                        North Carolina
                     had sent sixty-eight adults to 
                        Duck Creek
                     and 
                        Spiceland
                    ; only two joined Anti-Slavery Friends. Quakers from 
                        Virginia
                    , and those from eastern 
                        Ohio
                    , whose family ties often were with 
                        Virginia
                     or eastern 
                        North Carolina
                    , showed an equal antipathy for abolition. No Friend from 
                        Virginia
                     joined Anti-Slavery Friends, and of the forty-six adults in the two monthly meetings
                    who had lived in eastern 
                        Ohio
                    , only Walter and Rebecca (Cox) Edgerton and Mary (Pennington) White went with the
                    separatists. Also notable is the fact that none of the Friends born in 
                        New Jersey
                     or 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , with the exception of James Gause of 
                        Spiceland
                    , "came out," which ties in with another striking fact: while about a
                    quarter (129) of the adults in the two monthly meetings who remained with the
                    "Body" were born in the North, only six of the sixty-three adults who separated
                    were northern born.
            In contrast, certain patterns were also significant among the separatists. Most Anti-Slavery Friends
                    at 
                        Spiceland
                     had at some time been members of New Garden Monthly Meeting in 
                  Guilford County, North
                        Carolina
               —sixteen of the twenty-two adults, in fact, had lived in 
                        Guilford County
                    , the heart of piedmont 
                        North Carolina
                     Quakerism. In 
                        Duck Creek
                    , half of the Anti-Slavery Friends had roots in two monthly meetings: Marlborough in
                            
                  Randolph County, North Carolina
                (bordering Guilford), and New Hope in
                            
                  Greene County, Tennessee
               . Indeed, half of the Quakers in the two monthly
                    meetings who had lived in 
                        Tennessee
                     joined the separatists. Here it was tempting to make a connection with earlier cases

                     of antislavery activism: 
                        Guilford County
                     had long been the center of antislavery sentiment among 
                        North Carolina
                     Friends. It had been settled in the 1750s largely by relatives of the famous Quaker
                    abolitionist John Woolman, and they were leaders in moving 
                        North Carolina
                     Friends toward a clear antislavery stance. Later, in the 1810s and 1820s, 
                        Guilford County
                     had been the heart of organized antislavery activity in the state.
                            
                  Greene County, Tennessee
               , was notable for similar activities at the same
                    time. And at least some Anti-Slavery Friends, such as Enoch Macy of 
                        Spiceland
                     and John Swain of 
                        Duck Creek
                    , had been active in these groups.24
            
            Such a conclusion, however, faced two difficulties. First, the Friends from east 
                        Tennessee
                     in the two monthly meetings consisted almost entirely of two extended families, and
                    such a sample is probably too small to be a basis for generalization. As for Friends with origins in 
                        Guilford County
                    , they were numerous in both monthly meetings, and in fact most of those from 
                        Guilford County
                     did not become abolitionists: they were 135 of 231 adults in the
                    "Body" at 
                        Duck Creek
                    , and 101 of 298 at 
                        Spiceland
                    . Ties to antislavery activities in 
                        North Carolina
                     and 
                        Tennessee
                     are also not especially meaningful. The 
                        North Carolina
                     Manumission Society (the state's antislavery organization, formed in 1816) and
                    its related organization in 
                        Tennessee
                     were gradualist groups that embraced colonization—in short, their attitudes
                    were closer to the ideas of the most conservative of the Indiana "Body" in the
                    1840s. It is not surprising that the 
                        North Carolina
                     Manumission Society included among its members men like Elijah Coffin, the clerk of
                    Indiana Yearly Meeting, and the prominent minister Jeremiah Hubbard, who were both inveterate
                    opponents of abolition with colonization sympathies.25
            
            Thus it is difficult to find any clear relationship between previous residence and antislavery
                    principles. It may have been a sine qua non for Anti-Slavery Friends to have had
                    some firsthand knowledge of slavery; virtually all of the abolitionists had roots in piedmont 
                        North Carolina
                     or east 
                        Tennessee
                    . But then so did most of those who remained with the "Body." And
                    certain groups—Friends from eastern 
                        North Carolina
                    , 
                        Virginia
                    , and eastern 
                        Ohio
                     and those born in the North—found little that was attractive in the
                    abolitionist movement.

            The timing of migration, the fourth social factor tested, also revealed little, as statistics in
                    table 4 show. At 
                        Duck Creek
                    , there was some indication that timing was important: of forty-one adult Anti-Slavery
                    Friends, thirty, or about 75 percent, had come north after 1831. In contrast, almost 90 percent of
                    the "Body" Friends had arrived before 1831. It is possible that the Hinshaw and
                    Wright families who, as will be seen, made up most of the membership of the Anti-Slavery group, had
                    witnessed the reaction to Nat Turner's Rebellion, which may have played a part in their
                    radicalization. But in 
                        Spiceland
                    , the timing of migration was remarkably similar for both groups—about three
                    quarters of each had come north before 1830.
            Closely related was age at the time of the move north; could it be that direct contact with slavery,
                    or the memory of it, was crucial in motivating Anti-Slavery Friends, and that
                    "Body" Friends lacked such memories? Again, Anti-Slavery Friends had had such
                    contact—findings in table 5 show that the overwhelming majority had lived in the South
                    long enough to be conscious of the institution. Yet this is also true of a majority of
                    "Body" Friends. It is equally valid to say that the overwhelming majority of
                    Friends in the two monthly meetings with memories of the South did not become abolitionists.
            The fifth variable, age, proved more helpful in explaining the separation. Certain patterns did
                    emerge, showing that abolition appealed most to young and least to older Friends. At 
                        Spiceland
                    , the oldest of Anti-Slavery Friends, Elias Jessup, was forty-eight in 1842. The rest of
                    the 
                        Spiceland
                     separatists were rather evenly distributed from age twenty to forty-five. (See table
                    6.) The situation at 
                        Duck Creek
                     was slightly different. Some older Friends did separate; the eldest, Jesse Wright, Sr.,
                    was seventy-three at the time of separation. But there, as at 
                        Spiceland
                    , the overwhelming majority of Anti-Slavery Friends was under age
                    forty-five—at least thirty-one of forty-two. Overall, however, the age distribution of
                    Anti-Slavery Friends reflects the age distribution of the two meetings, and in every age group, the
                    overwhelming majority chose to remain with the "Body."
            Family ties, the sixth variable, did produce some notable patterns in both communities and at first
                    glance seemed to explain some of the patterns of separation. As statistics in tables 7 and 8 show,
                    family ties and a high degree of kinship solidarity were striking among both
                    "Body" and Anti-Slavery Friends. In the 
                        Spiceland
                     "Body," about 7 percent (twenty adults) consisted of the families of
                    the brothers Eli and Nathan Gause with their spouses and children. Another 7 percent (nineteen
                    adults) was made up of the families of Stephen Macy, Sr., and his brother Thaddeus, who had died in 
                        North Carolina
                     but whose widow and children had come to Indiana. One of the largest kinship networks

                     monthly meeting consisted of descendants of the matriarch
                    Charity (Williams) Hiatt, who had sat at the head of the 
                        Spiceland
                     meeting until her death in 1840 at the age of nearly ninety. Her son Joel Hiatt,
                    daughters Rachel Kersey and Rebecca Unthank, and grandchildren John Hiatt, Anna (Hiatt) Unthank,
                    Anna (Kersey) Boone, and Mary (Kersey) Sheridan, along with their families, made up 24 of the 276
                    "Body" adults. The family of old Charity's younger sister Ruth (Williams)
                    Gordon accounted for another fourteen. Of all the Gordon and Hiatt descendants in the meeting, only
                    one joined Anti-Slavery Friends, Combining these four kinship groups with Smalls, Sheridans, Whites,
                    and Hodsons accounts for almost half of the "Body" membership.26
            
            Many 
                        Spiceland
                     "Body" Friends, moreover, had family ties to high officials of the
                    yearly meeting outside 
                        Spiceland
                    . George Evans, probably the leading antiabolitionist in either community, was not only
                    the assistant clerk of the yearly meeting but the brother of Thomas Evans, the clerk of the Meeting
                    for Sufferings. John Hiatt and Anna (Hiatt) Unthank were siblings of Naomi (Hiatt) Coffin, the wife
                    of Elijah Coffin, while Joel Hiatt and Rebecca (Hiatt) Unthank were Naomi's aunt and uncle.
                    Richard J. Hubbard, who appears to have been the single most active member of 
                        Spiceland
                     Monthly Meeting, was the son of eminent minister Jeremiah Hubbard, whose name was a
                    byword among Indiana abolitionists because of his support of colonization. William B. Unthank, the
                    husband of Rebecca and another "weighty" 
                        Spiceland
                     Friend, was the stepson of William Hobbs, a fervent proponent of disciplinary action
                    against the abolitionists and an influential member of the Meeting for Sufferings.27
            
            Similar ties bound 
                        Duck Creek
                     "Body" Friends. Of the 231 adult conservatives, 29 were the families
                    of three Presnall brothers, Stephen (1772–1822), John (1778–1856), and Daniel
                    (1786–1870). If Dempsey Reese, the illegitimate son of Stephen Presnall's wife
                    Hannah is included in this kinship group, it accounts for about 13 percent of the monthly
                    meeting's membership after the separation. The wife of Daniel Presnall was Pleasant Modlin,
                    whose aged mother Ann (Newby) Modlin was the oldest person in either community at the time of
                    separation and whose descendants included another thirteen 
                        Duck Creek
                     Friends. Twenty-two of the 
                        Duck Creek
                     "Body" consisted of a triangle of Ratliff first cousins. The mother
                    of most Ratliffs, Elizabeth (Pearson) Ratliff, was a half-sister of Nathan Pearson, whose wife was
                    Huldah (Lamb) Pearson. Huldah's sister was the weighty Friend Rebecca Ratliff, 
                  
                     26These relationships were determined from 
                                Spiceland
                             Monthly Meeting records in Heiss, Abstracts, and the
                            abstracts of 
                                North Carolina

                     widow of one member of the Ratliff triangle. These four family
                    networks—Presnalls, Ratliffs, Pearsons, and Lambs—accounted for about 40
                    percent of "Body" adults after the separation. When three more families are
                    added—Hiatts, Stanleys, and Pickerings—the total comes to almost two-thirds of
                    the monthly meeting's membership after the split. These kinship networks produced only
                    three Anti-Slavery Friends.28
            
            There were similar patterns among Anti-Slavery Friends. At 
                        Spiceland
                    , a majority of abolitionists consisted of three pairs of brothers and
                    families—Elias Jessup (1794–1868) and Tydemon Jessup (1800–1866),
                    Enoch Macy (1797–1870) and William Macy (1799–1872), and Jesse White (born
                    1805) and the family of his brother Isaac White (1798–1840). The six men were first
                    cousins, grandsons of Isaac and Catherine (Stanton) White. Family connections may explain how they
                    were originally drawn into abolition, since the Whites' sister Catherine was the wife of
                    Levi Coffin of 
                        Newport
                    . Of the 
                        Spiceland
                     separatists, only Vierling Kersey, James and Rachel (Johnson) Gause, Walter and Rebecca
                    (Cox) Edgerton, and Peter Pearson left all of their relatives behind to embrace Anti-Slavery
                    Friends. At 
                        Duck Creek
                    , thirteen of the twenty-four families or parts of families among Anti-Slavery Friends
                    were those of the brothers Benjamin Hinshaw (1782–1866) and Seth Hinshaw
                    (1787–1865) and their children and Jesse and Ann (Clearwater) Wright and their children.
                    Three more were Willitts sisters and their husbands; the sisters' mother was a First cousin
                    of the Hinshaw brothers. 
                        Duck Creek
                     Anti-Slavery Friends may also have been influenced by kinship ties beyond the monthly
                    meeting, One Wright sister was married to a son of Charles Osborn, the best-known minister among
                    Anti-Slavery Friends. Seth Hinshaw's first wife, Hannah Beeson, had died before he left 
                        North Carolina
                    , but he had maintained close ties with her brothers, who were pillars of Anti-Slavery
                    Friends in adjacent 
                        Wayne County
                    . John Swain, another 
                        Duck Creek
                     abolitionist, was the brother of Elihu Swain, a 
                        Wayne County
                     Anti-Slavery Friend who was married to a sister of Daniel Worth, the president of the
                    Indiana State Anti-Slavery Society.29
            
            Thus the separation in both communities was characterized by a rather high degree of kinship
                    solidarity. The Hinshaws and Wrights went out almost as a unit, leaving behind in the case of 
                  
                     28See note 26.
                  
                     29These relationships were determined through the abstracts of 
                                Duck Creek
                             Monthly Meeting records in Heiss, Abstracts, and Hinshaw, Encyclopedia. For Seth Hinshaw's relations with the Beeson
                            family, see Seth Hinshaw to Isaac W. Beeson, 6th Mo. 21, 1849, and n.d., box 1, Isaac W. and
                            Benjamin B. Beeson Papers (Indiana Division). For the Swains, see Heiss, Abstracts, II, 175; and Thomas D. Hamm, "Daniel Worth: Persistent
                            Abolitionist" (Senior Honors Thesis, Department of History, Butler University,
                            1979), 5.
               
                     the former, two sons who had married into weighty
                    "Body" families and in the case of the latter two daughters whose husbands were
                    not Friends. Only the Bowmans were fractured by the separation of their sister Annis Hinshaw, the
                    wife of Benjamin, along with two Wilson brothers who took opposing sides and three Willits sisters
                    who left behind their father and stepmother. (One wonders if this might somehow be related to the
                    fact that their stepmother had been a Stanley.) At 
                        Spiceland
                    , only the Macy and Stanton White families were badly fractured; the other seven largest
                    family groups, accounting for 119 adults, produced only 4 Anti-Slavery Friends.
            The nature of this kinship solidarity, however, was complex, not lending itself either to patriarchal
                    or matriarchal characterizations. At 
                        Duck Creek
                    , of the twenty-four families or parts, all but three were related to other Anti-Slavery
                    Friends there. In ten cases this connection was through the husband, in ten through the wife, and in
                    one through both. 
                        Spiceland
                     Anti-Slavery families were a bit more lopsided in their ties. Of the fifteen families
                    or parts there, four had no ties to other Anti-Slavery Friends, while in the case of seven it was
                    through the husband and but four through the wife. But it would be wrong to see this community as a
                    patriarchal world in which women were left with no choices except those made for them by male
                    relatives. The wives of Elias Jessup, Vierling Kersey, and Peter Pearson at 
                        Spiceland
                     all remained with the "Body" when their husbands joined Anti-Slavery
                    Friends. It is reasonable to think that the decisions of Benedict and William R. Macy, the two adult
                    sons of Enoch and Nancy Macy, to remain with the "Body" were affected by the
                    prominence of their wives' families, the Gordons and Dickses, among the
                    "Body." The same sorts of influences may explain why John and Cyrus Hinshaw, the
                    sons of Benjamin and Annis at 
                        Duck Creek
                    , remained with the "Body": their wives were daughters of Rebecca
                    (Lamb) Ratliff and Cadwallader Pitts, respectively, both elders among "Body"
                    Friends. A striking case of a woman who made up her own mind was Miriam (Macy) Baldwin, the widowed,
                    childless aunt of William, Enoch, and Nathan Macy. She made her home with Nathan and Jane (Wilson)
                    Macy while they leaned toward joining Anti-Slavery Friends and attended their meetings. In poor
                    health, she had no way of going to meeting unless her nephew took her in a wagon, which forced her
                    to meet with separatists. Yet sure that the leaders of the "Body" were the
                    ultimate repository of religious wisdom, she refused to join Anti-Slavery Friends. In addition,
                    there were apparent cases of men being drawn to Anti-Slavery Friends by their wives. The only child
                    of Benjamin and Annis Hinshaw to separate with them was their daughter Ann with her husband Thomas
                    Cox. At least three daughters of Jesse Wright, Sr., with their husbands followed their parents.
                    James L. Presnall at 
                        Duck Creek
                    
                     was apparently led to break with the rest of his family by his
                    courtship of Martha P. Bales of 
                        Westfield
                     in 
                        Hamilton County
                    , whose parents and siblings were pillars of Anti-Slavery Friends there. And at least
                    two daughters of William and Phebe Macy brought their husbands out of the "Body"
                    after 1842, marrying them in the Anti-Slavery meeting and thus forcing them to face disownment by
                    the "Body."30
            
            While these sorts of family connections must mean something, they do not explain everything. Take for
                    example William and Enoch Macy—their brothers Nathan and Solomon remained behind with the
                    "Body," as did their sister Anna after considerable soul searching; the two were
                    step-brothers of Elijah Coffin himself. None of Enoch Macy's adult children separated with
                    him and, as has been shown, even the wives of three 
                        Spiceland
                     separatists did not join their husbands. Walter and Rebecca Edgerton's family
                    ties all should have inclined them toward the "Body." Walter's brother
                    Joseph was not only one of the most influential ministers in 
                        Ohio
                     Yearly Meeting but also one of its foremost opponents of the abolitionist movement,
                    characterizing it as an "overactive, restless spirit" that "like the
                    locust, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar" was "ready to eat up every green
                    thing." One of the weapons that the Meeting for Sufferings had used in its attack on
                    abolition in 1841 was the printing and distribution of an essay by the 
                        Ohio
                     minister. Rebecca (Cox) Edgerton was the daughter of Joseph Cox, one of the yearly
                    meeting's weightiest elders and one of the most influential members of the Meeting for
                        Sufferings.31
            
            Family, then, played a role in the decisions of at least some of these Quakers in how to respond to
                    the Anti-Slavery split. But it does not explain the decisions of all. The ultimate answer to the
                    question of motive lies in an examination of the relationship of the two sides with their meetings
                    and their attitudes toward the Discipline that defined what Quakerism was.
            Anti-Slavery Friends rhetoric provides an important clue. Antebellum Indiana Quakers lived in a world
                    circumscribed by the elaborate body of custom and tradition embodied in the Discipline. Aside from
                    their insistence on joining antislavery societies, no one 
                  
                     30 Heiss and Hinshaw abstracts were used to determine these
                            relationships. For Miriam Baldwin, see Miriam Baldwin to Jesse Baldwin, 9th Mo. 29, 1844,

                     31 These relationships were determined through the use of the Heiss
                            and Hinshaw abstracts. For Joseph Edgerton, see Eunice Thomasson, comp., Some
                                Account of the Life and Religious Services of Joseph Edgerton, a Minister of the Gospel

                                Philadelphia

                     ever accused Anti-Slavery Friends of seeking to weaken that
                    Discipline. Indeed, few defenders were more rigorous in its application or in devotion to it. After
                    the separation, Anti-Slavery Friends continued to use the old Indiana Yearly Meeting Discipline with
                    but two changes—no one under complaint was to take part in business meetings, and no
                    Friend was to vote for a slaveholder. Anti-Slavery Friends had no desire to live outside its
                    guidance. As Huldah Wickersham, a young Friend in another 
                        Henry County
                     meeting wrote, "Our anti-slavery principles had not destroyed our love for
                    religious society, nor our desire to watch over one another for good; but seeing we were altogether
                    denied religious privileges, there was no other alternative left us." In other words, one
                    could not be a true Friend without participating in the affairs of the society, and the actions of
                    the yearly meeting made that impossible. Charles Osborn exhorted the separatists in 1842:
                    "Let all our Friends who are virtually cut off from the communion and fellowship of Society
                    … still bear in mind that they are acting in strict accordance with the spirit of the
                    Discipline and with the Gospel of Christ, and that they ought not to be terrified and driven back
                    because of church censure."32
            
            Moreover, Anti-Slavery Friends saw the very purity of the Society of Friends threatened. As the
                    conference that founded the new society proclaimed, there was "a universal liability in all
                    associations, both civil and religious, to deterioration and corruption." Declension was
                    the only possible explanation for the actions of Indiana Yearly Meeting against the abolitionists.
                    Now a "reformation" was necessary, but, with the loss of their positions and right
                    to participate effectively in business meetings, there was no hope for success. So their sole choice
                    was to separate and to hope that as a separate body they could lead Friends back to the Light.
                    Paradoxically, in order to uphold the whole of the Discipline, these Quakers violated part of its
                        letter.33
            
            In this urge toward reformation, these Friends had precedents from the Quaker past. In the 1750s and
                    1760s the favorite prophet of Anti-Slavery Friends, John Woolman, had helped to lead a reformation
                    movement that had tightened the Discipline and given it the form that molded the lives of Indiana
                    Quakers. Again, in the 1820s, other Friends, this time led by Elias Hicks, had seen corruption and
                    outside influences creeping anew into the society and so had sought to purge the society of them. In
                    the first case, the reformers were successful and permanently changed the course of Quaker history.
                    The second had led its proponents, the Hicksites,

                     toward separation. Although Anti-Slavery separatists in Indiana
                    would have spurned any comparison or affiliation with the Hicksites, their courses were similar.34
            
            Thus, one would expect to find that Anti-Slavery Friends at 
                        Duck Creek
                     and 
                        Spiceland
                     were Friends concerned about upholding the rigor of the Discipline, active in the
                    affairs of the society, and skeptical about the encroachment of outside forces, all of which were
                    confirmed. An examination of the minutes of the two monthly meetings showed that the backdrop to the
                    separation at 
                        Duck Creek
                     was a bitter controversy from 1834 to 1837 over the proper understanding of Quaker
                    doctrine. It also demonstrated that Anti-Slavery Friends were not powerless and disfranchised before
                    the separation—they held offices and were active in the society out of proportion to
                    their numbers. Indeed, close study of the records suggested that Anti-Slavery Friends were, as a
                    group, more devoted to strict observance of the Discipline than were members of the
                    "Body."
            The separation at 
                        Duck Creek
                     took place in a monthly meeting with an almost uniquely troubled history. It had been
                    badly split by the Hicksite separation in 1828; one member left declaring that "Elias Hicks
                    [the leader of the Hicksites] is as good a man as Jesus Christ and that a certain approved minister
                    aught to be killed off." In the mid-1830s, new difficulties festered. Their source is
                    obscure, but hints suggest that the controversy pitted primitivists opposed to innovation against
                    Friends in sympathy with the yearly meeting's leadership, which was moving in an
                    increasingly evangelical direction that emphasized points of agreement with other denominations and
                    deemphasized Quaker peculiarities. In the fall of 1835, a proposal to set up a Sunday School, or
                    "First Day School for Scriptural Instruction," as Friends referred to it, died
                    because of lack of unity in the monthly meeting. A year later, the monthly meeting's
                    committee on education reported that it was so badly divided that it was impossible to keep up the
                    monthly meeting's school in 
                        Greensboro
                    . At the same time, the routine matter of appointing a new overseer dragged on for four
                    months, stalled by disagreement over the right person. Doctrine was also an issue. A quarterly
                    meeting committee of weighty Friends reported late in the summer of 1837 that the ministers and
                    elders of the monthly meeting were "in unity" with the yearly meeting, but that
                    "a number of the members … stood opposed to the order of our society."
                    At issue was a controversy over the nature of the resurrection (traditionalist Friends said that it
                    was purely spiritual, while evangelical Quakers were coming to argue that physical bodies would be

                     raised up at the Last Day) that a visit by Joseph John Gurney,
                    a prominent English Quaker minister, aggravated. In August, 1837, Whitewater Quarterly Meeting
                    ordered that 
                        Duck Creek
                     Monthly Meeting be "laid down" or dissolved and that its members be
                    joined to 
                        Spiceland
                     Monthly Meeting.35
            
            The significance of this struggle is that the losers appear to have been those who five years later
                    became Anti-Slavery Friends. The most notable was Seth Hinshaw, the monthly meeting treasurer. He
                    had not only been vocal in the doctrinal controversy, but when the monthly meeting was laid down, he
                    responded by circulating a manuscript that 
                        Spiceland
                     Monthly Meeting considered "defamatory … and instrumental in
                    exciting disunity and discord among Friends." Hinshaw backed down, but another 
                        Duck Creek
                     Friend of similar views, Mathew Symons, was disowned. Cast out at the same time was
                    Henry Lamb, who, over the "repeated objections" of the elders and overseers, had
                    been preaching in Clear Spring Meeting. Lamb had close ties with Seth Hinshaw—they came
                    from the same Quaker community in 
                        North Carolina
                    , Lamb's daughter Mary had married Hinshaw's only son Jabez, and the
                    two had had business dealings both in 
                        North Carolina
                     and Indiana.36 When 
                        Duck Creek
                     Monthly Meeting was reestablished in 1840, its members quickly went back to their old
                    ways. Attempts to establish First Day and monthly meeting schools failed. Then in the fall of 1842
                    the monthly meeting found itself split again over a complaint that Eli Stafford, an overseer and
                    active Friend, was guilty of "defamation and detraction." Once more, the quarterly
                    meeting intervened. The case was still under deliberation when the separation began.37
            
            Closer examination of the lives of 
                        Duck Creek
                     Friends reveals, however, that this sort of disciplinary disorder was more
                    characteristic of "Body" Friends than of separatists. One striking difference
                    between the two groups was their experience of the Discipline. Over a third of
                    "Body" families (thirty-nine of ninety-one) at

                     contained a husband or wife who was not a member. Of these
                    thirty-nine, thirteen had a husband or wife who had never been a Friend, while sixteen contained
                    ex-Quakers who had been disowned after the marriage, suggesting that these were families in which
                    abiding by the judgment of the meeting was not a special concern. Typical was Thomas Newby, whose
                    wife Sarah was active in the monthly meeting's affairs. He had been read out of Back Creek
                    Monthly Meeting in 
                  Randolph County, North Carolina
               , in 1825 for shooting a neighbor's
                    cow and stubbornly refusing to pay any compensation. When, after coming to Indiana, he had requested
                    that his membership be restored, Back Creek had refused its permission after finding that he had
                    left behind not only bad debts but a generally un-Friendly reputation. The rest of the thirty-nine
                    consisted of families in which a husband or wife had "married contrary to
                    discipline," meaning that they were Friends married in a non-Quaker ceremony and, unlike
                    their spouses, had been unwilling to "condemn their misconduct" or make an apology
                    to the monthly meeting.38
            
            Overall, about 30 percent (72 of 231) of the adults in 
                        Duck Creek
                    's "Body" had faced disciplinary action at some point in
                    their lives. In most cases (60 of 72) it was for common marriage offenses. But others who were still
                    members in 1842 had records that might be described as "colorful." Richard
                    Ratliff, Jr., formerly an elder and one of the meeting's most active members, had actually
                    been disowned in 1837 for fathering an illegitimate child, although he had regained his membership
                    three years later. Daniel Presnall had feuded with the monthly meeting for two years over the poor
                    committee's treatment of his stepmother. Charges of slander, profanity, and drunkenness
                    were proffered against him in response. His brother John was pulled in as well, accused of
                    "vague testimony," "slanderous accusation," contradictory
                    statements, and making threats. John Presnall's son-in-law Henry Lewelling (a nephew of
                    Thomas Newby the cowkiller) was at the same time forced to acknowledge his "malicious and
                    unchristian disposition toward one of his neighbors" and "use of an expression
                    shocking to Christian feelings." And, of course, when the separation took place still
                    another influential "Body" Friend, Eli Stafford, was "under
                        dealing."39
            
            In contrast, the record of Anti-Slavery Friends suggests significantly less in the way of such
                    confrontation. Of the twenty-two

                     married couples, only five had not been married in meeting, and
                    there were only three adults among them whose spouse was not a member. Only two Anti-Slavery
                    Friends, Seth Hinshaw and Mathew Symons, had ever been in any other kind of disciplinary difficulty
                    while at 
                        Duck Creek
                    , and they, of course, were on the losing end of a tangled theological dispute. The only
                    other Friend who had faced disciplinary proceedings was old Jesse Wright, Sr., who had been disowned
                    in 
                        Tennessee
                     in 1820 on the rather vague charge of "denying his own assertion." He
                    regained his membership in 1835. In short,

                     Anti-Slavery Friends appear to have been more consistent in adherence to traditional
                    principles and practices of Friends than those who remained with the "Body."40

                    , in contrast, had not known the conflict and division 
                        Duck Creek
                     had faced. Its minutes and the accounts of various visiting Friends suggest a world of
                    relative harmony and scrupulous adherence to the Discipline. A much lower percentage of its members,
                    about 20 percent, had married out of meeting, and, in contrast to 
                        Duck Creek
                    , only a seventh of the "Body" families included a husband or wife who
                    had been disowned or were never members. Of the fifty-two adults in the 
                        Spiceland
                     "Body" who had been disciplined, only four were involved in any sort
                    of moral transgression—theft, premarital sex, making a "lewd
                    proposition," fathering an illegitimate child. 
                        Spiceland
                    , in short, offered few attractions for the unruly sorts of Friends who found a more
                    congenial home a few miles north along the banks of 
                        Duck Creek

                        Spiceland
                     "Body" was a straitlaced group, however, Anti-Slavery Friends were
                    even more so. Every married couple among them had been married in meeting, and, so far as can be
                    determined from existing records, not one had been the subject of any disciplinary action before the
                        separation.42
            
            As for influence and power, or "weight," in the two monthly meetings before the
                    separation Anti-Slavery Friends were hardly

                             Friends were more lax in the administration of the Discipline. It seems
                            unlikely that so many

                             Friends would have filled important positions in the yearly meeting if their

                            1833–1842, Indiana Yearly Meeting Archives. John M. Macy, who arrived in 
                                Spiceland
                             just as the separation was beginning, is not included in this count. Although
                            he received no appontments before 1843, he received so many afterwards from the
                            "Body" that it would be misleading to label him as lacking weight.
               
                     shut out. In the case of 
                        Duck Creek
                    , John and Ann (Lewis) Swain had been elders in 
                        Tennessee
                    , and at 
                        Duck Creek
                     they were overseers, as were Obediah and Armelia (Hinshaw) Elliott and Abigail (Rees)
                    Wright. Seth and Benjamin Hinshaw had been overseers in 
                        North Carolina
                    , and at 
                        Duck Creek
                     Seth Hinshaw served as the monthly meeting treasurer. His son Jabez was the monthly
                    meeting librarian. And if one measures weight by frequency of committee appointments, reference to
                    statistics in tables 9 and 10 shows that the number received by Anti-Slavery Friends was comparable
                    to those received by "Body" members. Only four men and three women in the monthly
                    meeting, for example, received more than Seth Hinshaw, the leader of the radical abolitionists.43
            
            The situation was even more striking at 
                        Spiceland
                    . Anti-Slavery Friends there had filled offices out of all proportion to their numbers.
                    Rebecca (Cox) Edgerton had been clerk not only of the women's monthly meeting but of the
                    quarterly and yearly meetings as well before she was thirty-five. Both Phebe (Hiatt) Macy and her
                    brother-in-law Enoch Macy had been elders in the monthly meeting, and both Louisa (Bundren) White,
                    the widow of Isaac, and Nancy (Rayl) Macy, the wife of Enoch, had been overseers. Isaac White, who
                    died in 1840, had been an elder, clerk of the quarterly meeting, and a member of the Meeting for
                    Sufferings. His younger brother Jesse White had been 
                        Spiceland
                     Monthly Meeting's first assistant clerk. In terms of committee appointments,
                    Anti-Slavery Friends at 
                        Spiceland
                     were more active than the average for the monthly meeting. While about 55 percent of
                    "Body" adults had never received any kind of appointment, only 28 percent of
                    Anti-Slavery Friends could so claim. Walter Edgerton was one of the three most active members of the
                    monthly meeting, while no one received more appointments than Louisa (Bundren) White. Of the twelve 
                        Spiceland
                     women who had an average of four or more appointments a year, four—Louisa
                    (Bundren) White, Phebe (Hiatt) Macy, Diana (Hinshaw) Macy, and Rebecca (Cox)
                    Edgerton—became Anti-Slavery Friends.44
            
            At its most basic level, of course, discord was a contest over power. Anti-Slavery Friends justified
                    separation because they had lost their positions of influence, which, they said, would hinder their
                    effectiveness in fighting slavery. But they did not become abolitionists because they were excluded
                    and isolated; they became

                     excluded and isolated because they had made the decision to
                    become abolitionists, and most of the yearly meeting found that threatening.
            What, then, do the experiences of these communities reveal about the abolitionist movement,
                    especially in Indiana, and about Quakerism? The experiences show us that among these Friends, at
                    least, the decision to become an abolitionist was not a function of wealth or
                    property—economically, Anti-Slavery Friends were a cross section of their communities.
                    Nor was abolition a function of previous residence or length of time in 
                        Spiceland
                     or 
                        Duck Creek
                    . Age does seem to have been a factor; abolition apparently held little appeal for
                    Friends born before 1795. Complex kinship ties connected abolitionist families, but there were
                    numerous exceptions to this rule. What quantitative work does show is that, by and large,
                    Anti-Slavery Friends were those who were committed to strict observance of the Discipline,
                    regulating their lives by the peculiarities of Quakerism, defending the traditional doctrines of
                    Friends against change.
            Such observance was a matter of individual conscience, and thus one is drawn to something that
                    historians can never hope to recapture completely—moral choice. Scholars can reconstruct
                    many of the elements of the environment in which these Quakers lived and can look at the
                    declarations in which they corporately explained their behavior; in a few cases, they can even
                    examine personal statements. But chroniclers of the past cannot recapture the individual conscience
                    of each Friend, and even if they could somehow question each individually, it is difficult to see
                    whether the feat would reveal much more. True, the upbringing of all as Quakers no doubt predisposed
                    them to antislavery, and moral values are undoubtedly shaped in large part by family; but
                    environment cannot be seen as a major causative factor. Decisions about separation are explicable
                    ultimately only by individual conscience.

                        Spiceland
                     were, of course, but two Quaker communities in Indiana that the separation affected.
                    Therefore, any conclusions based on these areas need comparison with the results of studies of other
                    Quakers that the separation also touched. But unless the experience of these 
                        Henry County
                     Friends was completely atypical, it constitutes a warning against attempting to explain
                    all religious behavior through quantifiable characteristics and forgetting the element of moral
                    choice in human response to all moral issues.
         
         
         
            Abraham Lincoln's Indiana and the Spirit of Mortal
            Douglas L. Wilson∗
            
            Abraham Lincoln was fond of poetry. As a young man, he memorized and recited the best-known poems of
                    Robert Burns, admired Lord Byron, and cultivated a taste for William Shakespeare that would last
                    throughout his life. Perhaps more than any other president, the self-educated Lincoln invoked his
                    familiarity with English verse, particularly the plays of Shakespeare, as a means of dealing with
                    the pressures and burdens of office. But his favorite poem, which he would recite alongside passages
                    from Hamlet, was so obscure that until the last months of his life he never knew
                    it in an authoritative text or even knew the name of its author.
            "Mortality" by the Scottish poet William Knox is better known by its first line,
                    "O why should the spirit of mortal be proud?" but it is safe to say it is only
                    known or remembered at all in association with Abraham Lincoln. This was true even in
                    Lincoln's life-time, when he was himself sometimes identified as the poem's
                    author, an attribution he found flattering. "Beyond all question, I am not the
                    author," he wrote to a correspondent. "I would give all I am worth, and go in
                    debt, to be able to write so fine a piece as I think that is."1 Judging
                    by the number of times he is reported to have praised it, recited it, and dictated or copied it out
                    for friends during the last twenty years of his life, it seems reasonable to conclude with David C.
                    Mearns that this obscure poem "had a special meaning for Abraham Lincoln."2

            Lincoln's recitation of "Mortality" must have been extremely effective, to
                    judge by the reactions of witnesses. One of the most revealing accounts is provided by Francis B.
                    Carpenter, who engaged Lincoln in literary conversation while painting his portrait in the White
                    House. Carpenter described an evening spent with Lincoln in his study, where the president began
                    talking about Shakespeare and then read several of his favorite passages, something he did often and
                    with great effect. "Relapsing into a sadder strain," Carpenter wrote, "he
                    laid the book aside, and leaning back in his chair, said, ‘There is a poem that has been
                    a great favorite with me for years, to which my attention was first called when a young man, by a
                    friend, and which I afterward saw and cut from a newspaper, and carried in my pocket, till by
                    frequent reading I had it by heart. I would give a great deal,’ he added, ‘to
                    know who wrote it, but I never could ascertain.’ Then, half closing his eyes, he repeated
                    the poem, ‘Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?’"3 Carpenter's reaction was typical of Lincoln's listeners: he
                    was surprised and delighted, and he asked for a copy of the text.
            Unlike the special meaning of "Mortality" for Abraham Lincoln, the poem's
                    meanings are not at all obscure. Its basic theme—that life is fleeting and death
                    inevitable—is modulated in each of its fourteen quatrains and is accented by the framing
                    question of the first and last lines:
                        O why should the spirit of mortal be proud! Like a swift flying meteor—a fast
                            flying cloud— A flash of the lightning—a break of the wave, He passeth
                            from life to his rest in the grave.
                         The leaves of the Oak, and the Willow shall fade, Be scattered around, and together be laid.
                            And the young and the old, and the low and the high, Shall moulder to dust, and together
                            shall lie.
                        The infant a mother attended and loved— The mother that infant's
                            affection who proved The husband that mother and infant who blest, Each—all are
                            away to their dwellings of rest.
                        The maid on whose brow, on whose cheek, in whose eye Shone beauty and pleasure—her
                            triumphs are by; And alike from the memory of the living erased And the memory of mortals,
                            who loved her and praised—
                        The hand of the King, that the scepter hath borne, The brow of the priest that the mitre hath
                            worn, The eye of the Sage, and the heart of the Brave, Are hidden, and lost in the depth of
                            the grave—

                        The saint who enjoyed the communion of Heaven, The sinner who dared to remain unforgiven; The
                            wise and the foolish, the gentle and just, Have quietly mingled their bones in the
                            dust—
                        The peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap. The herdsman who climbed with his goats up the
                            steep, The beggar who wandered in search of his bread, Have faded away like the grass that
                            we tread.
                        So the multitude goes like the flower or weed, That withers away to let other succeed, So the
                            multitude comes, even those we behold, To repeat every tale that has often been told.
                        For we are the same our fathers have been, We see the same sights our fathers have seen, We
                            drink the same stream, and view the same sun, And run the same course our fathers have
                            run—
                        The thoughts we are thinking our fathers would think, From the death we are shrinking our
                            fathers would shrink; To the life we are clinging they also would cling, But it speeds from
                            us all like a bird on the wing—
                        They loved, but the story we can not unfold, The scorned, but the heart of the haughty is
                            cold, They grieved, but no wail from their slumber will come, They joyed, but the tongue of
                            their gladness is dumb—
                        They died! Aye, they died. We things that are now— That walk on the turf that lies
                            over their brow, And make in their dwellings a transient abode, Meet the things that they
                            met on their pilgrimage road.
                        Yea, hope and despondency, pleasure and pain, Are mingled together in sun shine and
                            rain— And the smile, and the tear, and the song, and the dirge, Still follow each
                            other like surge upon surge—
                        Tis the wink of an eye, tis the draught of a breath From the blossom of health to the
                            paleness of death— From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud—
                            O why should the spirit of mortal be proud?4

                            the poem in the extremely rare collected edition of Knox's poetry (1847), which is

                            stanza 7; the version dictated to Francis B. Carpenter lacked stanzas 4 and 7. The earliest

                            it and its OBJECTS and INHABITANTS AROUSED FEELINGS in ME which WERE CERTAINLY POETRY."

                            .
                Intended by the poet as a recapitulation of the third chapter of Job and the first chapter
                    of Ecclesiastes, its Old Testament fatalism is unremitting and notably unrelieved by any suggestion
                    of an after-life. The fate of humankind—low or high, young or old—is that of
                    the leaves: both "shall moulder to dust." Human joy and grief, love and scorn, are
                    all mere repetitions of one's forebears and come to nothing. The predominant fact of life
                    is death. Pride in so transient a thing as a mortal is obviously misplaced.
            There can be little doubt that there was a connection between Lincoln's affinity for
                    "Mortality" and his recurrent melancholy. Indeed, one of the most conspicuous
                    features of Lincoln's personal demeanor was his frequent lapses into moods of profound
                    depression. He seems to have been subject to these spells from an early date, though he probably
                    attempted to disguise them at first. He told a fellow legislator in his 
                  New Salem, Illinois
               , days "that although he appeared to enjoy life rapturusly[,]
                    Still he was the victim of terrible melancholly. He sought Company and indulged in fun and hilarity
                    without restraint, or Stint as to time[.] Still when by himself, he told me that he was so overcome
                    with mental depression, that he never dare carry a knife in his pocket."5 Albert J. Beveridge noted that those who rode the circuit with Lincoln all referred to these
                    moods. "Everybody observed his absymal sadness. His gloom was not periodical and succeeded
                    by weeks of brightness, but was made manifest every day, yet interwoven with hours 
                  
                     5 Robert L. Wilson to William H. Herndon, February 10, 1866,
                            Herndon-Weik Collection (Manuscript Division, Library of Congress, 
                                Washington, D. C.
                            ).
               
                     of abnormal gayety—black despondency and boisterous
                    humor following one another like cloud and sunshine in a day of doubtful storm."6 Jesse W. Weik thought these reports must be exaggerated, so he made a point of
                    questioning those who knew Lincoln best: John T. Stuart, James H. Matheny, James C. Conkling, Samuel
                    H. Treat, David Davis, Leonard Swett, Henry C. Whitney, and others. Their responses convinced Weik
                    "that men who never saw him could scarcely realize this tendency to
                        melancholy."7
            
            Whether Lincoln was seriously suicidal when he told Robert Wilson that he dared not carry a
                    pocketknife is not certain, but the association of his despondent moods with the contemplation of
                    death would eventually become evident. His closest friends were concerned for his safety as well as
                    his sanity when he lapsed into despondency after the death of Ann Rutledge. And the agony of his
                    emotional crisis over his engagement to Mary Todd caused him to contemplate death and possibly even
                    suicide as a remedy. But his temporary moods were more than tinged with morbidity; as Beveridge has
                    pointed out, they were "strongly colored by apprehension of personal disaster.
                    ‘Billy, I fear that I shall meet with some terrible end,’ he said to his
                    partner William H. Herndon upon coming out of one of these fits of dejection."8
            
            What is notable here is that these moods or spells were often associated with a recurrence to poetry.
                    Though Lincoln's stories were known for their humor, his favorite poems were most often
                    sad. His attraction for Oliver Wendell Holmes's "The Last Leaf" was such
                    that some regarded it as his favorite, particularly the fourth stanza:
                        The mossy marbles rest On lips that he has pressed In their bloom; And the names he loved to
                            hear Have been carved for many a year On the tomb.
                     Lincoln told Carpenter: "For pure pathos, in my judgment, there is nothing finer
                    than those six lines in the English language!"9 He also evinced a
                    partiality for Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven," which

                            Several people mention Lincoln's fondness for this poem, but Henry Clay Whitney
                            singles it out as Lincoln's "all the year round" favorite. Henry

                     he often recited. "The music of Lincoln's
                    thought," wrote John G. Nicolay, "was always in a minor key."10
            
            But the poem most closely associated with Lincoln's melancholy by those who knew him was
                    Knox's "Mortality," a title so little recognized that the poem is almost
                    always referred to by its first line, "O why should the spirit of mortal be
                    proud?" Harriet Chapman, who lived with the Lincolns in 
                        Springfield
                     for a time, remarked on his spells and the fact they would sometimes "be
                    broken by a quotation from a favorite poem like ‘Mortality,’ ‘The
                    Last Leaf,’ or ‘The burrial of Sir Tom [John] Moore.’"11 Judge Lawrence Weldon, who as a young man traveled with Lincoln on the
                    circuit, described Lincoln's habit of rising early before the other lawyers and seating
                    himself before the fire. There the others would find him, "his mind apparently concentrated
                    on some subject, and with the saddest expression I have ever seen in a human being's
                        eyes."12 Weldon remembered that on one of these occasions Lincoln
                    "quoted aloud and at length the poem called
                        ‘Immortality.’"13 During his presidency,
                    Lincoln recited and praised the poem so often that it was sometimes reprinted and attributed to him.
                    By then it had taken on a special importance for Lincoln, for he is reported to have told a group of
                    friends that the poem was his "constant companion; indeed, I may say it is continually
                    present with me, as it crosses my mind whenever I have relief from anxiety."14
            
            Lincoln's law partner and biographer, William H. Herndon, thought he had discovered the
                    special meaning that "Mortality" held for Lincoln. In gathering information on the
                    early years in 
                        New Salem
                    , Herndon unexpectedly came across the story of Lincoln's tragic love affair
                    with Ann Rutledge, something he had previously known nothing about. From two dozen informants
                    Herndon gathered overwhelming testimony that Lincoln not only courted and became engaged to Rutledge
                    but that he became temporarily deranged with grief after her death in 1835.15
                    When he further discovered that Lincoln had known Jason Duncan, the man who

                    first showed Lincoln the poem, in 
                        New Salem
                    , Herndon conceived a bold hypothesis. "I've found out the history of
                    the poem called ‘Immortality,’" Herndon wrote to a friend.
                    "The facts which I shall reveal, for the first time in the world, throw a footlight on Mr.
                    Lincoln's sad life …."16
            
            The footlight came in a lecture Herndon delivered in 
                        Springfield
                     on November 16, 1866, which he had printed for distribution in advance and entitled "Abraham Lincoln. Miss Ann Rutledge. 
                            New Salem
                        . Pioneering, and THE Poem." In a "pre-Raphaelite"
                    mode of address as eccentric as his title, Herndon speculated that Lincoln's famous
                    melancholy was precipitated by the death of Ann Rutledge and that "O why should the spirit
                    of mortal be proud?" shown to him at the time, became fixed in his mind and was thereafter
                    recited in memoriam of Ann, the only woman he ever loved. This hypothesis and other aspects of the
                    lecture offended the Lincoln family and much of his nine-teenth-century audience and consequently
                    earned Herndon a name for irresponsible speculation that continues to this day. As John Y. Simon has
                    put it, Herndon had "grossly mishandled a major incident in the Lincoln story,"
                    from which "neither [his] reputation nor that of Ann Rutledge ever recovered."17
            
            In his biography, published twenty-three years later, Herndon put forward a more moderate version of
                    his theory: "It was shortly after this [Lincoln's derangement at the death of Ann
                    Rutledge] that Dr. Jason Duncan placed in Lincoln's hands a poem called
                    ‘Immortality.’ … He committed these lines to memory, and any
                    reference to or mention of Miss Rutledge would suggest them, as if ‘to celebrate a grief
                    which lay with continual heaviness on his heart.’ There is no question that from this
                    time forward Mr. Lincoln's spells of melancholy became more intense than ever."18 Herndon had thus satisfied himself that the significance of
                    Lincoln's favorite poem and his peculiar affinity for it lay deep in his great
                    partner's psyche, that it bore a direct relationship to the traumatic death of his first
                    love, Ann Rutledge, and that the poem's hold on Lincoln was therefore datable from shortly
                    after her

                            believed Lincoln's melancholy was hereditary and "part of his
                            nature." See Weik, The Real Lincoln, 113.
               
                     death. Herndon's conjecture is intriguing, and he had
                    collected reliable testimony that lent it credence. The most telling was Isaac Cogdal's
                    reported conversation with Lincoln in 1860–1861 in which the president-elect admitted not
                    only that he had loved Ann dearly but that he still thought of her often.19 As
                    David C. Mearns allowed, if we can accept the reality of Lincoln's romance with Ann
                    Rutledge, Lincoln's attachment to the poem is thus "perfectly
                        explained."20
            
            But even though recent scholarship has demonstrated that basic elements of the Rutledge romance can
                    be confidently accepted, there are other factual difficulties that make Herndon's theory
                    altogether unlikely. His biographer, David Donald, thought Herndon had no reason to think that
                    Lincoln had known "Mortality" at 
                        New Salem
                    , but he was mistaken.21 The key to Herndon's theory is the
                    role of Jason Duncan, the man that Lincoln had identified as the person who first showed him the
                    poem as a young man.22 Herndon had no idea who Duncan was or how or 
                    when he was acquainted with Lincoln, but by a persistence that was characteristic of his
                    investigations, Herndon tracked Duncan down late in 1866 and subsequently corresponded with him.23 Only one letter from Duncan survives in the Herndon-Weik Collection, a rather
                    full reminiscence of his nearly three years in 
                        New Salem
                     as a close personal friend of Lincoln's. No mention is made, however, of the
                    thing Herndon was most interested in, namely, the Knox poem. Moreover, while Duncan volunteered that
                    he "knew [Lincoln] had great partialities for Miss Ann Rutledge," he reported that
                    he left 
                        New Salem
                     in the autumn of 1834 and says nothing about the love affair or Ann's death,
                    which occurred a year later.24

                  24 Undated statement, Herndon-Weik Collection. Duncan says that he came to 
                            New Salem
                         at the same time Lincoln did and lodged with him for some time. For confirmation of
                        the friendship of Duncan and Lincoln, see the statement of J. Gaines Green, October 5, 1866, ibid.
               
            
            
            In his 1866 lecture, Herndon said Lincoln had been shown the poem in September, 1833, and that he
                    then took it up two years later at the time of Ann's death. What evidence Herndon had for
                    this is not apparent, but in his biography, as seen, he changed the time of Lincoln's first
                    acquaintance with the poem to after Rutledge's death in 1835.25 None of
                    the surviving documentation supports either conclusion. Nor does there seem to be any testimony to
                    support Herndon's contention in his lecture that Lincoln began reciting the poem to his
                    friends at this time. Often abused for taking positions that subsequently proved to be fully
                    warranted, Herndon's strong intuition about Lincoln's attachment to "THE
                    POEM" seems here to have caused him to overreach his evidence.
            A series of letters that Herndon may never have seen puts "Mortality" and
                    Lincoln's attraction for it in a different light. In 1846 and 1847 Lincoln sent four
                    letters to a lawyer and political associate, Andrew Johnston of 
                        Quincy
                    , 
                        Illinois
                    , enclosing some poetry in each of them.26 In the first letter,
                    dated February 24, 1846, Lincoln included the text of "Mortality," which Johnston
                    had previously requested. But Lincoln seems to have had a further motive for writing. "By
                    the way," he asked Johnston, "how would you like to see a piece of poetry of my
                    own making?"27 Johnston must have expressed interest, for each of the
                    next three letters contained what Lincoln described as a separate division or canto of a longer poem
                    written by himself.28
            
            Lincoln had been something of a poet much of his life. In a provocative essay, "Lincoln and
                    the Riddle of Death," Robert V. Bruce has called attention to some verses written in
                    Lincoln's commonplace book of 1824–1826: 
                        Time what an emty vaper tis and days how swift they are swift as an indian arrow fly on like
                            a shooting star the present moment Just is here then slides away in haste that we can never
                            say they're ours but only say they're past.
                    
                    
                  
                     25 In a manuscript that may have been prepared for the use of his
                            collaborator, Jesse W. Weik, Herndon first wrote, "Some years before this Doct
                            Jason Duncan placed in his hands a poem …" but subsequently changed this
                            to "Some year after …." See undated manuscript, "Miss
                            Rutledge & Lincoln," Herndon-Weik Collection.
                  
                     26 These four letters to Andrew Johnston were all first published
                            after Herndon's death. See Collected Works, I, 366–70,

                     28 In addition to the first canto discussed here, Beveridge notes an
                            interesting phenomenon in connection with Lincoln's poetry: "More than
                            once after a successful political contest he indulged in the making of verses. Lincoln did
                            this when Hardin withdrew from the fight for the congressional nomination, and again when he
                            had beaten Cartwright at the polls." Beveridge, Abraham Lincoln,
                            I, 383. One might add to this the light-hearted quatrain he got off after Lee's
                            defeat at 
                                Gettysburg

                     Bruce suggests that "Lincoln may have composed those
                    lines; he was known as a versifier in those days, and the spelling and grammar are certainly
                        original."29 Lincoln was indeed known as such in his boyhood in
                    Indiana, and these verses sound what would become, with the mature Lincoln, a very familiar theme.
                    Lincoln himself recited some of his Indiana verses to his friends in 
                        New Salem
                     in the 1830s,30 and Herndon discovered that there were old friends
                    in Indiana who could still remember and recite some of his verses thirty-five years after he had
                    moved away.31
            
            Though very little of Lincoln's verse survives, Gibson Harris testified that when he was a
                    clerk in Lincoln's law office between 1845 and 1847, he found in a drawer a substantial
                    manuscript of what appeared to be original poetry in Lincoln's hand. As he remembered,
                    these "stanzaed effusions … were all, or nearly all, iambics and pensive in
                    tone." Lincoln would not discuss them, but Herndon told Harris, "Yes, he has
                    sometimes scribbled verses, I believe, but he seems unwilling to have it known."32 Lincoln's letters to Johnston of this same period seem to represent
                    a cautious venturing in another direction.
            
            In the second letter to Johnston, dated April 18, 1846, Lincoln combined an explanation of what he
                    knew about "Mortality" with an account of the circumstances in which he was led to
                    compose the original canto he was sending to Johnston. After denying authorship of
                    "Mortality," he told Johnston: "I met it in a straggling form in a
                    newspaper last summer, and I remember to have seen it once before, about fifteen years ago, and this
                    is all I know about it."33 "About fifteen years ago"
                    would put his first acquaintance with the poem at about the time he first arrived in 
                        New Salem
                     in 1831, within a month of when Jason Duncan arrived. The letter then turned
                    immediately to the poem Lincoln was including: "The piece of poetry of my own

                            was 1825 I have seen the poetry it was charmingly good I thought he was well pleased with
                            his effort himself." Presumably this refers to Lincoln's Indiana period,
                            judging from the date Greene gives it, but there was a Noah Gordon in the 
                                New Salem
                             neighborhood when Lincoln lived there.

                     33 Lincoln to Andrew Johnston, April 18, 1846, Collected
                                Works, I, 378.
               
                     which I alluded to, I was led to write under the following
                    circumstances. In the fall of 1844, thinking I might aid some to carry the State of Indiana for Mr.
                    Clay, I went into the neighborhood in that State in which I was raised, where my mother and only
                    sister were buried, and from which I had been absent about fifteen years. That part of the country
                    is, within itself, as unpoetical as any spot of earth; but still, seeing it and its objects and
                    inhabitants aroused feelings in me which were certainly poetry; though whether my expression of
                    those feeling is poetry is quite another question."34 The original
                    verses thus described constitute a forty-line poem beginning "My childhood's home
                    I see again."35
            
            The association of "Mortality" with his own poem about his return to southwest
                    Indiana can hardly have been accidental. Lincoln's poem begins with the pleasures of memory
                    and moves toward a dramatic recognition of death as the principal force in the passage of time.
                    Memory, the poem says, purifies and transforms the past:
                        And, freed from all that's earthly vile, Seem hallowed, pure, and bright, Like
                            scenes in some enchanted isle All bathed in liquid light.36
                  
                     But to come to terms with the reality of the present, the poet is forced to acknowledge the
                    overwhelming presence of death.
                        The friends I left that parting day, How changed, as time has sped! Young childhood grown,
                            strong manhood gray, And half of all are dead.
                        I hear the loved survivors tell How nought from death could save, Till every sound appears a
                            knell, And every spot a grave.
                    
            
            The swiftness of time and the all-conquering grave are, of course, the predominating motifs of
                    "Mortality," the poem that Lincoln 
                  
                            34
                            Ibid.
                        
                  
                     35
                            Ibid., 378–79. Lincoln subsequently sent two more cantos: the
                            first was a description of the madness and pitiable condition of an Indiana contemporary,
                            Matthew Gentry; the other, a description of a frontier bear hunt. Though separate and
                            sufficiently distinct from "My childhood home I see again," both of these
                            pieces were apparently conceived as parts of a retrospective poem about Indiana, which may
                            never have been completed.
                  
                     36
                            Ibid., 378. The text exists in two slightly different versions. The one
                            given here was printed in the Quincy Whig, May 5, 1847, and is presumed by
                            the editors of the Collected Works to represent a revision of the
                            manuscript version in Lincoln's hand in the Library of Congress. The anonymous
                            editors of The Collected Poetry of Abraham Lincoln (
                                Springfield
                            , Ill., 1971) presume the opposite.
               
                     says he had first seen some fifteen years previously.37 Though his characterization of the poem as appearing in "a
                    straggling form" may mean that he remembered its proper form from his previous acquaintance
                    with it, the implication of what Lincoln told Johnston seems to be that he had taken little
                    cognizance of the poem in the fifteen intervening years. Herndon convinced himself that Lincoln
                    recited it frequently from the time of Ann Rutledge's death, though Lincoln's
                    closest friend of the ensuing years, Joshua F. Speed, may not even have recognized it.38 But the second time around, in the summer of 1845, there is no question that
                    "Mortality" made a profound impression on Lincoln. Gibson Harris remembered that
                    in his two years at Lincoln's law office, which began in September, 1845, it was
                    Lincoln's "favorite of favorites." "Many a time at the office
                    did he recite this poem, in whole or in part; for a while I actually thought he had written it, so
                    nearly did it resemble, in tone and meter, one of several compositions of his own that I had found
                    in the office desk."39
            
            
            The electioneering trip to his unpoetical childhood neighborhood in Indiana in October, 1844, is an
                    obscure event in Lincoln biography, and very little is known of what transpired, except that he gave
                    some speeches and renewed old friendships.40 But something important seems to
                    have come out of the Indiana experience, and the rediscovery of the poem
                    "Mortality" the following summer may have crystalized it in Lincoln's
                    mind and given it expression. He had come very far in the world since leaving Indiana in 1830. From
                    his hardscrabble beginnings with nothing to encourage education, he had risen to surprising heights.
                    He had become educated; he had gained a profession; and he had achieved, by his political efforts, a
                    measure of recognition. As Benjamin Thomas observes: "He had been disciplined by marriage
                    and family responsibilities and by four years of association with Stephen T. Logan. He had regained
                    his mental balance after the fiasco of 
                  
                     37 Though only an approximation, this estimate of fifteen years
                            clearly places the date well before the death of Ann Rutledge, which would have been only
                            ten years prior to Lincoln's rediscovery of the poem in the summer of 1845.
                  
                     38 Herndon seems to have raised the question of where Lincoln learned
                            "Mortality" with Speed at the time he was looking for Duncan and bearing
                            down on the Ann Rutledge affair. See J. F. Speed to Herndon, September 13, 1866,
                            Herndon-Weik Collection: "I know nothing of where he learned the Poem alluded
                            to."

                     40 Nathaniel Grigsby, a childhood friend, gave Herndon a brief account
                            of Lincoln's 1844 visit. See Hertz, The Hidden Lincoln, 368. A
                            notice of his speech at 
                                Rockport
                             appears in Collected Works, I, 341–42.
               
                     ‘the fatal first of January.’ Home life
                    and political disappointments had had taught him patience and self-control. He had come to the front
                    in politics against strong and determined rivals."41 Of the man who
                    became his law partner about the time of this trip, Herndon says, "Mr. Lincoln had
                    unbounded and unlimited confidence in his own mental powers, he was himself and wholly self-reliant,
                    asking no man anything."42 What this confident and self-reliant man
                    encountered in his boyhood home in Indiana was probably as unexpected as it was
                    unforgettable—the humbling fact of his own mortality.
            This is not, of course, to say that Lincoln had never confronted the fact or the prospect of death
                    before 1844. He had endured devastating losses through the deaths of his mother, his only sister,
                    and his fiancée Ann Rutledge, and had contemplated self-destruction as a means of
                    escaping his torturous mental depression. But having survived these traumatic events and surmounted
                    the formidable obstacles of poverty, ignorance, and obscurity, his experience in Indiana in 1844
                    seems to have presented him with the reality of his own mortality in a new
                    perspective.
            The profound emotional effect that Lincoln felt on his visit to Indiana calls to mind the plight of
                    one of Lincoln's idols, Thomas Jefferson, when stationed for five years as a diplomat in 
                        Paris
                    . Replying to a correspondent whose letter had reported much local news, including the
                    death of some of his acquaintances, Jefferson conjures up a fate for himself that is almost exactly
                    that of Lincoln's: "Fancy to yourself," he tells his correspondent,
                    "a being who is withdrawn from his connections of blood, of marriage, or friendship, of
                    acquaintance in all their gradations, who for years should hear nothing of what has passed among
                    them, who returns again to see them and finds the one half dead. This strikes him like a pestilence
                    sweeping off the half of mankind. Events which had they come to him one by one and in detail he
                    would have weathered as other people do, when presented to his mind all at once are
                        overwhelming."43
            
            If Lincoln's beguilement with "Mortality" in the summer of 1845 was
                    prompted by what had happened to him on his trip to Indiana the previous fall, his poem "My
                    childhood home I see again" may be regarded as an autobiographical record of that incident.
                    It appears to be an enactment of why the spirit of mortal should not be proud. The poem's
                    most forceful passages are of the boyhood friends he expected to see and the startling changes

                     time had interposed: "Young childhood grown, strong
                    manhood gray, / And half of all are dead." The poem tells how listening to the
                    "survivors" speak of those who have died magnifies the sense of mortality and
                    produces the sensation that every sound is a death knell, "And every spot a
                    grave." To visit old friends and familiar places is hardly to bask in the honors of the
                    present or even relive the pleasures of the past, for the poem ends:
                        I range the fields with pensive tread, And pace the hollow rooms, And feel (companion of the
                            dead) I'm living in the tombs.
                     The former friends and neighbors by whom the moderately triumphant Lincoln had expected to
                    be greeted were greatly changed—and half of all were dead.
            Lincoln became a very different man in the course of the next twenty years, and yet his attachment to
                    "Mortality" remained; if anything, it deepened. One of the things that makes it
                    difficult to fathom this connection is the difference in sensibility between Lincoln's time
                    and today. Lincoln's taste was very much a product of the nineteenth century, with its
                    notorious appetite for sorrow and sentimentality artfully laid on. As a result, the poem that to a
                    twentieth-century reader may seem a "jingle" and a "tedious
                        dirge"44 was to Lincoln a very different thing. The anapestic meter
                    that the twentieth-century reader may regard as artificial and inappropriate to its subject, he
                    seems to have found soothing. Sentiments that may seem to later generations lugubrious or depressing
                    actually consoled him in times of anxiety and grief. Far from sounding trite or bathetic, this poem,
                    Lincoln told a friend, "sounded as much like true poetry as anything he had ever
                        heard."45
            
            What Lincoln got from this poem is not easy to specify, though it is undoubtedly related to his
                    chronic melancholy and his well-established preoccupation with death. By his own testimony, the poem
                    crossed his mind whenever he experienced "relief from anxiety."46 His eulogy on Zachary Taylor in 1850, which he concluded by quoting six stanzas of
                    "Mortality," yields further clues.47 Immediately before
                    quoting these lines Lincoln observed: "The death of the late President may not be without
                    its use, in reminding us, that we, too, must die. Death, abstractly considered, is
                    the same with the high as with the low; but practically, we are not so much aroused to the
                    contemplation of our own mortal natures, by the fall

                     of many undistinguished, as that of one great, and well known, name. By the latter, we are forced to muse, and ponder,
                    sadly: ‘Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud!’48
            
            At the time of his trip to Indiana in 1844, and perhaps in succeeding years as well, the one great
                    name that filled the mind of the inordinately ambitious and self-confident Abraham Lincoln was his
                    own. That half of all the people he had known as a boy (and were thus in a position to appreciate
                    his success) should have been claimed by death was a shock for which, as his autobiographical poem
                    suggests, he was wholly unprepared. As he confessed to his friend Johnston, seeing those things had
                    aroused strong feelings. The experience forced him to see himself not as the returning prodigal but
                    as a "companion of the dead." For a man who had once professed the
                    "doctrine of necessity" and was inclined toward fatalism, this unexpected
                    confrontation with mortality may have resulted in something like a revelation. Death was inevitable.
                    It was not, as his previous experience had led him to think, an unlucky misfortune for the victim or
                    an undeserved affliction for the bereft; it was rather an irreducible fact—the crowning
                    fact of all human striving, no matter how vaunted or satisfying or successful. Such a discovery was
                    not without its consolations, and these would prove even more useful later on. But the
                    prodigal's pride had been misplaced, and his mood was caught by a poem he realized he had
                    been shown fifteen years earlier, soon after leaving his childhood home in Indiana, but whose
                    meaning he had been unprepared by experience to appreciate.
            Seeing the inception of Lincoln's affinity for "Mortality" in this context
                    holds out the possibility of enhancing one's understanding of his development, for it helps
                    to explain how and in what circumstances a touchstone expression became firmly established in his
                    consciousness. From 1845 onwards, "Mortality" served as an emotional tonic for a
                    man subject to recurrent and virtually disabling melancholy. He recited it frequently for his
                    friends and invoked it as a means of relief from anxiety in times of despondency and grief. Its
                    appeal, to be sure, was partly aesthetic, but it must also have been grounded in an identification
                    with the basic imagery of the poem—fathers and sons, time, birth and death, and the
                    earth—imagery that James Hurt has argued is "thematically continuous"
                    in Lincoln's writings from the Lyceum speech of 1838 to the Gettysburg address.49 The poem was undoubtedly related to what

                            object of "ponder," as he believes was Lincoln's intention,
                            rather than as a title for the poem, as the newspaper rendered it.

                     Bruce has aptly characterized as the "haunting sense
                    of human transience and ultimate helplessness—a sense in which all men are indeed
                    equal—[that] deepened [Lincoln's] compassion, forbearance, and ability to
                    comprehend both the extent and the bounds of what was possible in the brevity of life."50 For Abraham Lincoln, Knox's "Mortality" seemed to
                    lay out the facts of life and death in a way that assuaged his anguish, which, as his life unfolded
                    toward greatness, was an anguish that embraced an ever-widening circle of mortality.

            In July, 1923, at the first annual meeting of the Grand Dragons of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in
                            
                  Asheville, North Carolina
               , Daisy Douglas Barr, the only woman on the program,
                    read a poem, "The Soul of America":
                        I am clothed with wisdom's mantle;
                        Age and experience are mine,
                        Yet I am still in the swaddling clothes Of my existence.
                        I am strong beyond my years;
                        My hand typifies strength,
                        And although untrained in cunning
                        Its movements mark the quaking Of the enemies of my country.
                        My eye, though covered, is all-seeing;
                        It penetrates the dark recesses of law violation,
                        Treason, political corruption and injustice,
                        Causing these cowardly culprits to bare their unholy faces In the light of my all-seeing
                            revelations.
                        My vision is so broad
                        That my daily meditations force upon me new problems,
                        New situations and new obligations.
                        My feet are swift to carry the strength of my hand And the penetrations of my all-seeing eye.
                        My nature is serious, righteous and just, And tempered with the love of Christ.
                        My purpose is noble, far-reaching and age-lasting.

            Barr had come a long way to speak in 
                        Asheville
                    , both literally and figuratively. Born Daisy Douglas Brushwiller in 
                        Jonesboro
                    , Indiana, in 1878, she had become an evangelist at the age of sixteen and a recorded
                    Friends minister two years later. This vigorous Hoosier Quaker was active also in Republican
                    politics and became in the early 1920s the first woman to serve as vice-chair of the Indiana
                    Republican party. In 1922, as the state's key figure in women's Ku Klux Klan
                    activity, Barr organized the Queens of the Golden Mask and served as its Imperial Empress.2
            
            Barr's service as pastor of 
                        Muncie
                     Friends Meeting and as organizer of one of the Klan auxiliaries is not as disparate as
                    might be assumed. Rather, her actions form part of one continuum. Her development as a Quaker took
                    place amidst radical change in the Society of Friends, and Barr's life is in many ways
                    symptomatic of that change. Quakerism was becoming more and more a part of evangelical
                    Protestantism, as both pastors and revivals were increasingly accepted. Furthermore, many members,
                    like Barr, were being drawn from non-Quaker backgrounds.3 As for her Klan
                    connections, contrary to the contention of at least one scholar,4 Barr did not
                    follow her husband into the Klan but instead led him. A strong woman in her own right, she did rely
                    upon powerful men as patrons.

            Although Daisy Douglas Brushwiller's grandfather, George Douglas, was a Methodist minister,
                    her father, John W. Brush-willer, joined the Society of Friends after service in the Civil War.5 Her mother, Sarah, who evidently made considerable impression upon her,
                    dedicated Daisy as the seventh child to the ministry. In her early years Daisy attended both
                    Methodist and Friends congregations, but at age eight she received her call to ministry during a

                            the Quakers in Indiana had more enlistments in proportion to their membership than any other
                            denomination in the state. See Hamm, Transformation of American Quakerism,

                    Although Center Friends Meeting in 
                        Grant County
                     was a traditional silent meeting with limited preaching, the style of worship evidently
                    did not make enough of an impact to deflect her from her goal to be a minister. She was much
                    influenced by one member, Sallie Winslow Stephens, a public schoolteacher who had later gone to 
                        India
                     as a missionary.7 It is unclear how much education Daisy received,
                    but it is doubtful that she attended college. She was working as a clerk in a 
                        Jonesboro
                     department store and living with a woman friend before her marriage, although her job
                    also was not to deter her from the ministry. At sixteen she reportedly preached her first sermon,
                    after which she was "saved" at a United Brethren service conducted by a traveling
                    woman evangelist.8
            
            On November 21, 1893, she wed Thomas Dean Barr of 
                        Fairmount
                    . Born in 
                  Saint Clair County, Missouri
               , in 1870, Barr had come to 
                        Fairmount
                     with his mother, Elizabeth Dean Barr, who had relatives in the area, in 1874, shortly
                    after the death of his father. In 
                        Grant County
                     Thomas attended 
                        Fairmount
                     Academy. After his mother's death in 1876 Barr attended Indiana State Normal
                    School at 
                        Terre Haute
                     and then began a twenty-year career as a teacher in 
                        Grant
                     and 
                        Henry
                     counties.9 On December 14, 1895, the couple's only child,
                    Thomas Raymond, was born. At the same time Daisy was becoming more active in Friends meetings. She
                    had transferred her membership from Upland Monthly Meeting to 
                        Marion
                     in August, 1894, and less than a year later was recorded as a minister at the 
                        Marion
                     Monthly Meeting.1
            
            For the next few years Barr apparently followed her husband as he taught in various schools in east
                    central Indiana; frequently she pastored meetings and occasionally acted as a general evangelist for
                    Indiana Yearly Meeting. In 1898, for instance, she held a series of revivals in 
                        Kennard
                    , Indiana, and won a number of converts there. On April 18, 1900, she performed a
                    wedding at

                    commencement was canceled because "the inclemency of the weather compelled her to remain
                    home." Between 1900 and 1903 Barr was pastor of the Friends Meeting in 
                        Lewisville
                     (
                        Henry County
                    ), which was included in 
                        Hopewell
                     Monthly Meeting. In 1903 the Barr family took its membership from 
                        Hopewell
                     to Westland Monthly Meeting, and in 1905 
                        Barr
                     and 
                        Edna Hill
                     of 
                  Wichita, Kansas
               , held a revival in 
                  Fenton, Michigan
               , which
                    reportedly converted fifty people and added twenty new members to the Friends meeting there. In
                    1906, while her husband was principal at Van Buren High School in 
                        Grant County
                    , reports maintain that Barr "healed" a sick person at 
                        Portland
                     during a revival. Thomas Barr served for a time as deputy sheriff but moved on to a
                    succession of jobs, including meat inspector and deputy county clerk. In 1907 the Barrs returned to 
                        Fairmount
                     where Daisy preached and Thomas taught, first at 
                        Fairmount
                     Academy and then at the high school.11 Daisy was active in a
                    variety of reform movements in 
                        Fairmount
                    , usually dealing with temperance, but she also served as secretary of the Indiana Board
                    of Charities and Corrections.12 At twenty-nine, she had already achieved a
                    considerable reputation among Friends and even among social reformers beyond 
                        Grant County
                    .
            Three years later, in 1910, Barr first appeared in 
                        Muncie
                     as the minister of 
                        Muncie
                     Friends Meeting, although Thomas, who had been teaching at 
                        Fairmount
                    , had moved to 
                  Little Rock, Arkansas
               , to engage in business. By 1911,
                    however, he had become deputy auditor of 
                        Grant County
                    , and the family lived together in downtown 
                        Muncie
                     at 215 1/2 West Main Street.13 Daisy Barr's call to the 
                        Muncie
                     congregation was not out of keeping with the history of that meeting in particular or
                    of the Society of Friends in general; recall that Barr had served at least one congregation before.
                    Moreover, from the beginning of the system in Indiana Yearly Meeting women had served as pastors.
                    Esther Frame, for instance, a minister of great power, had exercised considerable influence in the
                    Midwest and in beginning the Friends church in

                  DAISY DOUGLAS BARR is CIRCLED at LEFT
                  
                  Courtesy Indiana Yearly Meeting of Friends Archives, Earlham College 
                                Richmond

                     Furthermore, Quakerism since the 1870s had been increasing its
                    emphasis on social purity, which perfectly suited Barr's growing zeal.
            Barr's role in 
                        Muncie
                     was in reforming the community through prohibition of alcohol, through creation of a
                    Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), and through the formation of a refuge for
                    former prostitutes—all in keeping with Friends testimonies. Yet her vigor, her political
                    savvy, and her considerable organizational talents were gradually deemed excessive. Moreover, the
                    tactics she used to promote her main cause—temperance—were often of
                    questionable legality and bespoke a willingness to use almost any means to achieve the desired end.
            Barr first became prominent in 
                        Muncie
                     in the wet campaign of 1911. After a long struggle, 
                        Muncie
                     had become dry in 1909. Indiana's Proctor Law of 1908 allowed an election to
                    vote on countywide prohibition if 20 percent of the voters signed a petition. Using the liberalized
                    standards, 
                        Delaware County
                     drys not only succeeded in obtaining an election in 1909 but in subsequently
                    overwhelming 
                        Muncie
                    's wets.15
            
            In the spring of 1911, wets counterattacked, circulating a petition for another election and
                    obtaining the requisite number of signatures. Even before the petition was presented, however, the
                    drys had begun to organize in opposition. Foremost among the dry forces was the Dry League, whose
                    president, Joseph A. Goddard, was a member of 
                        Muncie
                     Friends Meeting. As his pastor, Barr announced her intention to organize a group of
                    women supporters whose activities would supplement those of the Dry League.16
            
            The drys used the same strategy that had proven so effective two years earlier—mass
                    meetings with both local and outside speakers and a highly organized campaign to get their message
                    to residents. Barr played a leading role in influencing women. On April 6, she spoke at the Jackson
                    Street Christian Church to an enthusiastic audience of women and got a resolution passed promising
                    that the women would not vote for anyone who supported saloons (since women could not vote, they
                    would presumably influence those who could). Four days later the women drys had organized 
                  and garnered nine thousand new members in Indiana alone, which created a problem for
                            orthodox Quakers because the holiness influence rejected plain dress, silent meetings, and
                            pacifism, adopting a pastoral ministry. The first such meeting in Indiana was in 
                                Muncie
                             in 1878; Esther Frame was pastor. Ibid., 254-57; Hamm, Transformation of American Quakerism, 75-76, 83, 85-86, 100, 124-25, 127;

                     and opened an office next to the Dry League's
                    headquarters and selected Barr as the group's president. Barr organized the voters of the
                    first precinct using the Friends church as her headquarters and brought her sister, Mary McVicker,
                    from 
                        Fairmount
                     to speak at other area churches. She also recruited a former associate, Leora Bogue of 
                        Fairmount
                    , an evangelistic singer, to provide music at prohibition meetings, which were held as
                    often as four times a day. By campaign's end, however, Barr had become the center of
                    attention. The 
                        Muncie
                    
                    Star described Barr as "one of the foremost in the fight against the
                    saloons." On April 23 she attracted sixteen hundred women to a Sunday meeting held at the
                    Wysor Grand, a meeting she choreographed and over which she presided.17
            
            But the wets struck back. On April 27, one of Barr's aides, Carrie D. Hageman, an executive
                    committee member of the Dry League, was taken to city court on charges of libel, based on her
                    statement, "As long as policemen are blind to conditions there will be blind
                    tigers." Hageman's defense was that the statement in question was a general one
                    obtained from Barr, who had used it in a half-dozen cities. The explanation evidently placated the
                    authorities, for Hageman was released.18 Nevertheless, the dry campaign ended
                    with a spectacular parade the Saturday before the election. While Barr was not listed as a parade
                    official (Goddard was in charge), she had a prominent place, riding in a white carriage with Hageman
                    and Reba Richy, chair of the press bureau of the Dry League's auxiliary.19 The day before the election Barr spoke again at the Wysor Grand to her women's
                    group and received a "chautauqua salute" for her stirring call to arms, saying
                        
                        I am in this fight for what I can do for the sake of humanity, for God, for my fellow-man.
                            When the fight opened in 
                                Marion
                            , I went there. I called out against the brewers and saloonists; I called on the
                            soldiers, comrades of my father, to arise to the fight; I called on all who would like to
                            arise. They did arise to it and the town went dry.20
                  
                    
            
            All eyes were on

                     May 2, 1911, the largest city in Indiana ever to have a special local option election.
                    And although both sides were edgy, the election itself was relatively quiet. There were but nine
                    arrests: seven for illegal voting, one for assault and battery, and one for perjury. When the votes

                    precincts south of the railroad tracks won the election.21
            
            The scramble for saloon licenses after the election was as unseemly as the drys had predicted. Among
                    those who applied were William McIlvaine, a police captain and an ex-saloon owner who had joined the
                    force after the 1909 saloon-closing election, and Fred Puckett, another police officer who had
                    several convictions for intoxication and assault and battery.22 Eventually 
                        Muncie
                     had one ward where twenty-five saloons served most of downtown 
                        Muncie
                     and the red-light district.
            In spite of defeat, Barr was still taking a leadership role in the larger community. One result of
                    the dry campaign was formation of an institution for young people that would provide alternatives to
                    the saloon. The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) got the nod, and in the summer of
                    1911 
                        Muncie
                     witnessed a major campaign, led by members of the Ball family, to fund a new YMCA
                    building. The campaign raised two hundred thousand dollars, over half of it donated by the Balls,
                    which culminated in a visit by President William Howard Taft to congratulate the community on its
                    spirited citizens.23 Although there was an effort underway to build a
                    corresponding institution for women, it had accomplished little.
            Barr changed all that. Using the same techniques she had wielded so effectively in the local option
                    election, she held a series of meetings to publicize the YWCA. First named the Young
                    Women's Social and Physical Betterment Association, Barr's group met at the
                    Friends church with the object of "improvement socially and physically of the young women
                    of the city." Any girl in the community over fifteen was eligible to join. By the second
                    meeting, three hundred women had become charter members, and twenty-five directors had been chosen,
                    among them Barr and Elizabeth W. Brady Ball and Bertha Crosley Ball, representing virtually every
                    Protestant church and every social class in 
                        Muncie
                    . Before year's end 
                        Muncie
                     had a YWCA.24

                        Muncie
                     two years later when she had become president of the Humane Society. Although her
                    sympathies lay with the Citizen's party (representing drys) and the Republican party, she
                    had abstained from participation in the exciting municipal campaign. She had, however, been
                    promoting the idea of adding a policewoman to the force and helped arrange a meeting

                     between members of the Humane Society and mayor-elect Rollin G.
                    Bunch to discuss the possibility.25 Barr had pressed for the creation of the
                    post for several years because a policewoman would be, among other things, an instrument in
                    transforming prostitutes into reformed citizens.26 The results of the meeting
                    with Bunch were mixed; he agreed to appoint a woman to the force, but he would not tell his visitors
                    her name. When he did announce his selection, the woman he chose was Alfaretta Hart, wife of a 
                        Muncie
                     glass and automobile manufacturer. Hart, however, was not the kind of woman Barr and
                    the drys wanted—she was Catholic and wet. Furthermore, Hart had supported Bunch in the
                    campaign and, in a fiery speech at the Wysor Grand before the election, had attacked both
                    prohibition and the "corrupt society" that controlled 
                        Muncie
                    . Her appointment was announced two days after Barr and her group met with Bunch,
                    although she would not take office until early January. Before she had a chance to do so, the reform
                    coalition quickly attacked the appointment on two grounds: that the terms of her service made her
                    only a matron in charge of female prisoners and that her appointment should have been made by the
                    Board of Public Works, which was charged with selection and supervision of police, after the receipt
                    of twenty-five recommendations from local residents.27
            
            Barr was not sufficiently disaffected, however, to refuse the invitation of Bunch to offer the
                    invocation at the first meeting of the city council in January, 1914.28 Later
                    that same week the mayor's actions raised the hopes of Barr and fellow reformers. On
                    January 9, police staged huge raids on "blind tigers," on drug stores selling
                    illicit drugs, and on houses of prostitution.29 Barr had also become immediately
                    involved. On the night of the raids, she telephoned members of the police board, offering to speak
                    to the "fallen women." The following night, she chaired a meeting of several
                    reformers, including Reverend Edward Mason and Frank C. Ball. All agreed that a refuge for the women
                    who wished to abandon prostitution was needed. Barr had convinced them that "it was up to
                    the Christian people of 
                        Muncie
                     to prevent the women deprived of home and means of support by the order of the board
                    from being thrown on the streets, either to starve or infect the community with scattered evil
                    instead of a segregated one." The group decided to rent

                     a home in an undisclosed location and name it the
                    "Friendly Inn." Because of Barr's early involvement she became president
                    and Mason became vice-president when the board was organized on January 21. By that time the board
                    had additional resources: Amos Whiteley, a local industrialist, had donated $300; Milford
                    H. Lyon's tablernacle collection had amounted to $175; and the Women's
                    Club, true to its promise, had given $120.30
            
            Despite early monetary support, the Friendly Inn was plagued with difficulties from the start; the
                    board was even unable to hire a full-time matron. More seriously the founders had hoped that former
                    prostitutes would come into the refuge willingly but were soon disappointed. They also knew that
                    there would be temptations to "backslide" on the part of those who did come. But
                    they had hoped to avoid these temptations by hiring a matron to control the home, by placing the
                    refuge in a secret location, and by close police supervision. They were unsuccessful, however. By
                    February 10, the evening newspaper reported that the Friendly Inn was closed while the red-light
                    district was again open.31
            
            Barr did not admit defeat. While the inn was struggling, she had traveled to 
                        Chicago
                     to interview a prospective candidate for matron. When she returned, she learned of the
                    board's action to close the refuge and tried to reverse it. The board's rationale
                    was that since the town's regulation of brothels was lax, the refuge could not succeed
                    because of the temptations offered to its residents. When called upon to explain the opening of the
                    houses, city officials denied that any were open. Bunch even instructed two policemen to visit all
                    the sites raided. They reported back that no house was open.32 Given such
                    reassurance by the mayor, Barr determined to reopen the refuge, although ultimately the inn sank
                    quietly from public view. There is no further mention of it again in newspapers, nor is there
                    evidence that it reformed any prostitutes. The Friendly Inn was one of Barr's least
                    successful endeavors.
            Barr's attention was quickly diverted to another election. On February 7, 1914, the drys
                    presented a petition for a local option election containing thirteen hundred names, one hundred more
                    than required.33 Two weeks later the drys began an intensive campaign, again
                    utilizing the tactics from the previous election.

            In the dry campaign of 1914 Barr's role was much less conspicuous than in 1911. While she
                    spoke at meetings, she no longer was the organizer of women's branches of dry groups.
                    Furthermore, the wets ran a more aggressive campaign. Their most popular speaker was Hart,
                    Barr's former foe in the fight against prohibition. On March 4, Hart filled the Wysor Grand
                    to overflowing, with an additional 350 listeners compelled to sit on stage, hundreds crowding the
                    lobby, and others turned away. She delivered a scathing and sensational attack on the leaders of the
                    drys and accused them of being hypocrites who drank secretly, consorted with prostitutes, and
                    seduced young girls.34
            
            As the election neared, the drys stepped up their campaign, organizing women in various precincts,
                    some to serve coffee and free lunches to those working the polls and others to check voter
                    registration. Poll watching was in response to rumors that wets had imported over one hundred
                    outsiders and settled them in rooming houses to flood the polls.35 The drys also
                    countered the claims of wets that 
                        Muncie
                    's power elite wanted to vote the town dry while still imbibing. Prohibitionist
                    lecturers spoke to employees of Warner Gear and 
                        New York
                     Central, as well as to assembled machinists whose employers had released them for the
                    speeches. Barr spoke at Ball Brothers to what was evidently a hostile audience.36 The situation in 
                        Muncie
                     was complicated by the normal division in law enforcement between a largely wet city
                    police force and a dry county sheriff. Election day was prickly as a near civil war erupted between
                    the two law enforcement agencies. When the election was over, the drys had won, but each side was
                    angry over the other's strongarm tactics.37
            
            Barr was not long in 
                        Muncie
                     to savor the victory; two weeks afterward she entered a sanitarium in
                            
                  Madison, Tennessee
               . According to a cryptic note in the evening paper, Barr was
                    accompanied by a nurse to 
                        Cincinnati
                     where another nurse from the institution escorted her the remainder of the way. The

            On July 22, Barr resigned her 
                        Muncie
                     pastorate, giving poor health as the reason. At the annual meeting of the church board,
                    she indicated that her problems were a weak heart and a general breakdown that prevented her from
                    carrying out church routine. She promised to continue to preach until September 1 but planned to
                    spend most of her time north at her Winona Lake summer home, commuting to 
                        Muncie
                     only on weekends. In the fall she and her son would move back to 
                        Fairmount
                     so that he could continue his education. Her husband, the newspaper reported, was a
                    state accountant and was working in a northern county; presumably, he would join his family at
                        Winona Lake.39 The 
                        Muncie
                     accounts of Barr's leaving commented on her successes in 
                        Muncie
                    , specifically mentioning that she was the only woman member of the ministerial
                    association and that she was a member of the boards of the 
                        Delaware County
                     Children's Home and the Humane Society. They failed to list her work as a dry,
                    however, or as a founder of the YWCA or the Friendly Inn.40
            
            Why had Barr left? Was it really because of ill health? That is difficult to believe; she was only
                    thirty-seven and had been quite active with no hint of illness earlier that year. Furthermore, her
                    later career showed no signs of invalidism, for despite her poor health, Barr had apparently already
                    made future plans. On September 13, she joined Reverend Milford H. Lyon,41 who
                    also had a summer home in Winona Lake, on an evangelical crusade beginning in
                            
                  Chillicothe, Ohio
               . Barr was in charge of the newly created women's
                    department and was quoted as saying that she was well-acquainted with evangelistic work, having
                    begun her career as an evangelist.42 Nevertheless, life on the evangelical trail
                    surely was more strenuous than life in an old manse.
            If illness was not the reason, several explanations are possible. Historian Anne Szopa speculates
                    that Barr's brief association with Democrats (and wets) Bunch and Hart in the aftermath of
                    the prostitutes' arrest may have ruined her credibility with dry leaders. Perhaps there was
                    difficulty with church leaders because of her

                            The community built Lyon a wooden tabernacle near the downtown business area's
                            saloons. Lyon evidently was also a powerful speaker, attracting 87,995 persons into his
                            makeshift auditorium in November alone. Barr had become chair of the daily noon meetings.

                     sponsorship of the refuge for prostitutes, or with business
                    leaders because of her Sabbitarianism.43 Barr herself gave another reason. In
                    her book of sermons she indicated that she had become interested in interdenominational evangelism
                    in unconventional sites— garages, factories, and tabernacles—and had wanted to
                    reenter the field.44 But because her first duty was to her son, she remained in
                    pastoral work. When he went away to college, and with her husband's consent, she felt free
                    to become an evangelist again.45
            
            In spite of her departure, 
                        Muncie
                     was important in Barr's development. There she had learned how to organize
                    women into effective pressure groups, how to align herself with powerful members of the community,
                    and how to cross party lines to coalesce with erstwhile political opponents. Although cognizant of
                    the power of her rhetoric, she had also learned how tough and resilient opposition could be. In one
                    of her later sermons, she noted that politics had a bad name because mayors in some cities had been
                    arrested for bad conduct and had not been impeached by irate citizens. She also claimed that in one
                    city in Indiana four dry workers were slandered and beaten to near death. These are obvious
                    references to the situation in 
                        Muncie
                     where raw force often seemed to carry the day.46
            
            The record of Barr's life for the next few years is unclear. Evidently staying with the Lyon
                    crusade only one year,47 she then traveled extensively on her own evangelical
                    trips, earning the nickname of "Mother" Barr. She is mentioned in the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Star in 1916 in an article on pioneer women of Indiana. By 1917 the Barrs appear
                    to have located to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , where Thomas was employed as an examiner for the state board of accounts.48

                        date the book. The sermons are obviously written after Barr left 
                            Muncie
                        ; one sermon notes that World War I had been in progress for twenty-eight months,
                        which would date it about 1917. There is also a picture of her son in uniform that would date
                        from either 1917 or 1918. On the other hand, the book contains pictures of meetings held in a
                        glass plant that looks like Ball Brothers and a frame tablernacle resembling the one in 
                            Muncie

                         and Barr had said her son would enter the academy. Barr's son later

            By the 1920s Daisy Barr had become a powerful figure in the political life of the state, acquiring
                    two significant positions: president of the Indiana War Mothers, a group whose sons had served in
                    World War I and that was an adjunct to the newly formed American Legion, and vice-chair of the
                    Republican State Committee, the first woman to fill the post. Her husband, meanwhile, had become
                    deputy state bank commissioner.49 And Barr's political activity had not
                    snuffed out her religious career. In July, 1920, she accepted a call to the 
                        New Castle
                     Friends Church, which had been without a pastor for some time. Using her flashy
                    techniques she had considerable success in increasing the size and financial position of the church.
                    She even coined a motto for the church: "The Church for the Family and the Family for the
                    Church." She was pastor for almost two years, retiring on June 19, 1922, in a way quite
                    similar to the manner done in 
                        Muncie
                     ten years earlier. She declared that she had been ill with influenza and that she had
                    never had a real vacation. After leaving 
                        New Castle
                     she planned to tour Europe in July and spend the winter in 
                        Egypt
                    . She then said she would eventually become an evangelist for the Five Years Meeting but
                    would continue to live in 
                        New Castle

            Barr, however, did not "retire" but instead moved more actively into politics. When
                    Indiana Governor Warren T. McCray selected her for vice-chair of the Republican State Committee in
                    1922, he also appointed Lawrence Lyons as state chairman of the Republican party (previously McCray
                    had appointed Lyons to the state highway commission in 1921). In 1923 Lyons and Barr embarrassed
                    McCray and the Republican party when it surfaced that they had joined the Ku Klux Klan; both then
                    resigned their party posts.51

                        Barr's death in 1938 said she moved to

                         fifteen years earlier.

                        residence was said to be 
                            Fairmount

                        that the Barrs kept two residences, one in 
                            Fairmount
                         and one in

                         was Thomas Barr's legal residence. In any case, Barr's crusades
                        probably kept her away from either place much of the time. In fact, while living in 
                            Indianapolis
                        , she apparently preached regularly for a time at the Friends Meeting in

                        probable that Barr's nascent ties with the Ku Klux Klan were the reason for her leaving

            The reasons for Barr's and Lyon's involvement in the KKK lie in the history of the
                    Indiana Klan; Indiana was the first state north of the Ohio River to establish
                    a Klavern, on August 13, 1921,52 after which the Klan spread rapidly through the
                    state. In 1922, 6.4 percent of all Klan members lived in Indiana, 
                        Ohio
                    , and 
                        Illinois
                    ; two years later the percentage was 40.2. The total number of Klan members in Indiana
                    is a matter of dispute; some estimate the total at about 125,000, while others place it at 500,000,
                    one-half the adult male population.53
            
            As it became one of the most powerful political groups in the state, the Indiana Klan soon attracted
                    many drys and minsters to its ranks. Historian John Augustus Davis has indicated that a major
                    attraction was the problem of prohibition enforcement.54 The cooperation between
                    drys and the Klan operated in the state legislature. Edward S. Shumaker, superintendent of the
                    Anti-Saloon League and a dominant force in the Indiana General Assembly in the early 1920s,
                    cooperated with the Klan to push old-time religion and bone-dry prohibition among state
                        legislators.55 The enrollment of ministers was a calculated move by David C.
                    Stephenson, who instructed Kleagles to send him lists of ministers in the community. He would then
                    make them honorary members and tell them that he would require Klan members to attend. If the
                    sermons were favorable, donations would be forthcoming. As a result nine of ten Klan lecturers were
                    introduced as "reverend."56 Because of this emphasis the Klan
                    enrolled many Protestant ministers, particularly Baptists, Methodists, and Disciples of Christ. In
                    turn, notes 
                  Indiana University, 1971), 79–83. Lyons claimed to have only been a member of
                            the Klan for six weeks and announced his resignation from the KKK by a telegram to Tolerance, an anti-Klan newspaper. The circumstances of both leaving were
                            not made public, so the pressure exercised by the Indiana Republican Committee was not
                            measured. George R. Dale,

                            Klansman. Indeed, he was brought out of jail in 1928 to testify as a prosecution witness
                            against Governor Ed Jackson, who was on trial. McCray claimed Jackson offered him ten
                            thousand dollars to appoint a Klan member as county prosecutor and he refused.

                     historian David M. Chalmers, the Protestant pulpits supplied
                    the respectability, the orators, and a good part of the local leadership of the Klan.57 The Klan also succeeded in fundamentalist chapels and tabernacles; one of the centers
                    of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Klan was the Cadle tabernacle.
            Indiana Friends, both pastors and members, were also often deeply involved with the Klan. According
                    to historian Leonard Moore, even 
                        Richmond
                    's large Quaker community, "one of the oldest and most influential in
                    the state, showed no special immunity to the Klan." There, for example, 6.6 percent of the
                    Klan members were Quakers, while they represented 12.2 percent of the Klan members who indicated
                    religious membership.58 The organizer and most significant leader of the Klan in 
                        Wabash
                    , for instance, was Ira C. Dawes, pastor of the 
                        Wabash
                     Friends Church and president of the local Rotary club. Dawes became the pastor in 1921,
                    but resigned in 1923 to go to 
                        Texas
                     to head the KKK's national speaker's bureau.59
            
            The Klan's appeal to Barr is obvious; liquor, political corruption, and prostitution were
                    old enemies. Her Methodist and Quaker heritage and her evangelical experience also must have
                    influenced her. In addition, she had always had a nativist strain, manifest in her sermons, despite
                    showing compassion for foreign workers in her 
                        Muncie
                     pastorate. Apparently, however, her Quaker background did not cause her to reflect upon
                    the Klan's deserved reputation for coercion and intimidation. When it became publicly known
                    that she was a Klan member, Barr was forced to resign from the Indiana War Mothers in early 1923 as
                    well as from her position with the Republican party. In the announcement of her resignation as head
                    of the former no mention is made of her Klan attachment.60 George R. Dale, a
                    Klan-fighting 
                        Muncie
                     editor who disliked Barr, claimed that she had said that her evangelical duties and a
                    planned trip abroad made her too busy, although he believed that opposition to the Klan had forced
                    the move.61
            
            In spite of public reservation, Daisy Douglas Barr deepened her Klan activity. In December, 1922, she
                    apparently joined the Queens of the Golden Mask. Stephenson had organized the women's

                     adjunct to the Klan even before Imperial Headquarters had
                    formed its auxiliary. Barr was one of the charter members, if not the leader, and soon became the
                    Imperial Empress. The Queens of the Golden Mask was quite successful. Officials reported that
                    "women are proving the best supporters of the organization after having suggested their
                    joining." In addition, the Queens formed what Stephenson named his "poison
                    squad," an information network extending across the state staffed by women and used to
                    spread rumors about his opponents.62 On February 24, 1923, Barr signed an
                    agreement with King Kleagle Stephenson in 
                        Indianapolis
                     to form a women's auxiliary under his sponsorship,63
                    although the agreement did not assure her of complete control over all women Klan members in the
                    state, because other Klan members were forming their own women's auxiliaries. Among them
                    were Imperial Wizard Hiram Wesley Evans, whose organization was known as the Women of the Ku Klux
                    Klan, and Grand Dragon William J. Simmons, who called his group the Kamelias.64
            
            By July, 1923, Barr also became head of the Women of the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana, having made an
                    accommodation with Evans. But that was not the limit of her authority. On July 17, 1923, she signed
                    a contract with the Klan to organize Indiana, 
                        Kentucky
                    , 
                        West Virginia
                    , 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , 
                        Ohio
                    , 
                        Michigan
                    , 
                        New Jersey
                    , and 
                        Minnesota
                    . By terms of the contract she would receive one dollar for each woman initiated as a
                    member after July 9, 1923.65 The initiation fee was not her sole reward. Because
                    she headed the Women of the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana she also received four dollars for every member
                    recruited, acquiring the title of "State." In return, she was supposed to act as
                    the conduit for requests for robes sent to national headquarters.66 The sale of
                    robes was a Klan monopoly that provided a considerable portion of the organization's funds.

                        received the same amount that the Kleagle who recruited a member earned. Each candidate paid a
                        $10.00 fee, the Klecktoken. Of that, the Kleagle got $4.00, the King
                        Kleagle of the state received $1.00, the Grand Goblin got 50¢, the
                        Imperial Kleagle got $2.50, and the Grand Dragon $2.00. Elrod,

                        Perhaps she did all the recruiting. The funds earned would be considerable as Kenneth T. Jackson
                        estimates the number of Klanswomen in 
                            Indianapolis

            Barr plunged into her Klan activities with considerable vigor. She was present in 
                        Richmond
                     May 25, 1923, when the Klan sponsored a naturalization ceremony, a march with two
                    hundred women, and an appearance by the 
                        Muncie
                     Girl's Band. On July 25, 1923, she led a march of three hundred Klanswomen
                    through 
                        Kokomo
                    . After the march four hundred women were initiated into the Klan, although Barr
                    lamented that one thousand more members were present but lacked the proper regalia. On August 25,
                    1923, the northern convention of the Klan met in 
                        Marion
                    's Goldthwaite Park, and Barr was present representing the national
                    organzation. Three months later, on November 17, 1923, the Klan held its most spectacular parade in 
                        Wabash
                    ; at its terminus on the courthouse lawn Barr pleaded for women to hold on to their
                    right of equal suffrage and reprimanded a local officer for his uncouth remarks.67 Later that year rumors circulated that 
                        Indianapolis
                     would become the national headquarters of the Women of the Klan. In part, this was a
                    move to boost the claims of Stephenson for ultimate control of the Klan,68 but
                    it also reflected Barr's ambition for greater things.
            The ceremonial aspect of Klandom was not an aberration, nor was Barr's participation new for
                    her. She had learned the value of such performances in 
                        Muncie
                     temperance campaigns. As for the Klan, Moore says, "Ostentatious
                    demonstrations, parades, and holiday celebrations, as well as more mundane social events, were in
                    fact the most frequent activities of individual Klan chapters, the means through which the average
                    member participated in the organization."69 But Barr sometimes
                    overstepped the bounds. At the end of the year, she and four Klansmen, including her son, tried
                    unsuccessfully to crash the annual Ambulance Chair banquet at the 
                        Marion
                     Hotel in 
                        Grant County
                     in order to convert members of that group to the Klan.70 This
                    incident injured her reputation much less than a damage suit filed by a 
                        Muncie
                     woman, Mary Benadum, for defamation of character on January 2, 1924.71 Once more, Hoosiers were treated to a fight by the dynamic minister.
            
               
                        Muncie
                     was a hotbed of Klan activity. Leading businessmen had brought the Klan to town in 1922
                    "to cope with a corrupt Democratic city government."72 Among
                    those who joined the Klan

                     were Clarence Benadum, prosecuting attorney of 
                        Delaware County
                     and a dry, and Mary Benadum his wife, a 
                        Muncie
                     schoolteacher.73 Barr had come to 
                        Muncie
                     in 1923 to address Klanswomen. At a meeting of five hundred members, Klan spokeswomen
                    repeated a charge by Barr that Mary Benadum, who had been organizing Klan activity in 
                        Ohio
                    , had stolen three thousand dollars. Because Mary Benadum was not permitted to answer
                    these charges at the meeting, she called a caucus of her supporters at a local hotel, but the
                    accusers intruded and repeated the charges. Later, when the Women of the Ku Klux Klan met at 
                        Campbell
                    's Auditorium, Barr spoke to the two thousand assembled members and again
                    repeated the claims. When Benadum again was not allowed to speak, she thereupon sued for damages in
                    the amount of fifty thousand dollars.74 Mary Benadum's suit never came
                    to court, even though infighting continued. Clarence Benadum left the county prosecutor's
                    office in January, 1924, to be the Kleagle of 
                  Columbus, Ohio
               , 75 and Mary Benadum went to 
                        Alliance
                    , 
                        Ohio
                    , to continue her Klan organizing early in January. Rival factions of the women tangled
                    in 
                        Alliance
                    , however, and she ended her trip in the hospital suffering from nervous exhaustion.76 Neither she or her husband pursued the matter. On November 14, 1924,
                    Benadum's charges were dismissed after Barr filed an answer of "confession and
                    avoidance," saying the slanders were uttered by Judge James Comer and Imperial Wizard Evans
                    and that she had merely repeated them.77 The charges could have been refiled but
                    were not.
            Soon Barr's charges of stolen money backfired. Dale described her as "a woman
                    Quaker preacher who forsook the pulpit to grab off the blood-drenched, filthy dollars of the Ku Klux
                    Klan," who had gone to visit Imperial Wizard Evans in 
                        Atlanta
                     and had received the title of "Quaker Queen Quince of the Giosticuticus of the
                    Jimpelcute." There, Evans had given her the franchise to sell robes in the realm for
                    $6.50 each, with the understanding that she buy the robes from him. Instead, she
                    contracted with a company in 
                        Anderson
                     to make the regalia for 77¢ and allegedly pocketed the difference. Daisy
                    "Doodle" Barr (Dale's name for her) had, Dale claimed, made over one
                    million dollars and was considering retiring to 
                        Germany
                     after having her diamond reset in platinum.78
            
            The newspapers reported a second suit on June 3, 1924, filed by the Women of the Ku Klux Klan in the Grant-

                            names. He also claimed that she had made a speech in 
                                Wabash
                             where she said that if Christ were on earth, he would be a Klansman.
               
                     Court in 
                        Marion
                    , which claimed Barr had failed to account for one hundred thousand dollars she had
                    obtained in fees from the Klan. According to the suit, Barr had "naturalized" five
                    thousand members, had reported their entry into the Klan, but had failed to pay the Klan its dollar
                    for each. An additional forty thousand members had been enrolled but not reported, adding another
                    forty thousand dollars to the debt. Finally, the Klan estimated Barr owed between fifty-four and
                    sixty-seven thousand dollars for robes that she had supplied from a non-authorized source.79
            
            The news apparently did not trouble Barr; according to friends, she was not "worried the
                    least bit." Although out of state, she said the suit was the result of a dispute over
                        leadership.80 The news did delight Barr's foe, Dale, who composed a
                    poem for the occasion, "Daisy kept the Nighty Money":
                        Daisy Doodle's sued again By Hi this time and and not by Ben. Perhaps you think that
                            Daisy's flighty But she's got it all at ten per nighty. A million bucks
                            she got, tis said And gave the wizard nary a red. So the goblins cussed and the dragons
                            swore They'd get the dough or a bucket of gore.
                     Dale philosophized that "Whenever one klucker or one kluckeress begins to make a
                    lot of dough the rest of 'em gang up on him, or her, as the case may be, and try to get it
                    away from him, or her."81 Three weeks later, Dale reported that Barr
                    was again in trouble. Under a headline entitled "Dizzy Daisy Barr and Mrs. Shinn Grabbed
                    the Korn," he recounted how Josephine Shinn of

                  Zanesville, Ohio
               . Later the Queens discovered their treasury was missing. As a
                    result, a grand jury indicted the two principals for embezzling the funds.82
            
            As the Klan's fortunes in Indiana and the Midwest ebbed, so did Barr's, who soon
                    slipped from the public limelight. Her husband became state bank commissioner in 1925, appointed to
                    that position by Governor Ed Jackson, who reputedly had Klan connections.83

                        Indianapolis
                    , Barr left Indiana sometime after her legal difficulties and went to 
                        Florida
                     where she apparently ran for Congress in 1926.84 She soon returned
                    to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , however.
            Barr died April 3, 1938, of a broken neck suffered in an automobile accident on U.S. Highway 31,
                    between Speed and Memphis, while riding to 
                        Indianapolis
                     with a family friend, William E. Rider, a 
                        Waynetown
                     banker. She was sixty years old and died the day before she was to serve as hostess of
                    a silver tea of the Meridian Women's Christian Temperance Union at the Banner-Whitehill
                    Auditorium. She was buried at her hometown of 
                        Fairmount
                    .85
            
            A woman in a man's world, Daisy Douglas Barr consistently allied herself with the rich and
                    powerful: Frank C. Ball, Joseph Goddard, Milford H. Lyon, Warren T. McCray, David C. Stephenson,
                    Hiram Wesley Evans. At the same time, there was no doubt that she was her own woman. While men aided
                    her in gaining the public forum she needed, her success was in large part due to her skill as an
                    adroit organizer, an eloquent orator, and a symbol manipulator. Her major concerns were always the
                    same: ending the liquor traffic and protecting and nurturing young women. These concerns came from a
                    genuine religious conviction, not just from her Friends background but also from her Methodist
                    heritage. How much she was corrupted by materialism in her later career is a moot question. Like
                    some twentieth-century television evangelists, she claimed she became rich through God's
                    efforts. Furthermore, her Klan episode is not as startling as it appears at first glance. The
                    Klan's emphasis upon prohibition and on social purity, though mocked by actual practice,
                    must have appealed to Barr's own ideals. The nativism espoused by the Klan also struck a
                    familiar chord in Barr. Even the tactics—the public marches, the torchlight parades, the
                    mass meetings, the coercion, and the violence—had been anticipated by the dry campaigns
                    in

                        again. He and Luther F. Symons, the bank commissioner, were indicted by a 
                            Howard County
                         grand jury in 
                            Kokomo
                         on charges of negligence in connection with the failure of the American Trust
                        Company. The grand jury claimed Barr and Symons knew the bank was insolvent in March, 1924, but
                        did nothing about it. Ibid., December 27, 1927. Symons was a Quaker and a
                        banker from Lewisville, where Daisy had been pastor from 1900 to 1903.

                        negligence, he was unavailable for comment because the family was vacationing in

            Ultimately the qualities that made Barr a success also caused her to fail. Her conviction, her
                    ego-strength, and her willingness to use almost any means to achieve her goals led her to an
                    intolerance that was the antithesis of her Quaker faith. That she failed to see and understand this
                    cannot completely erase her genuine achievements in social reform.

            Alvin Nugent "Bo" McMillin seemed like the real thing. During a time when
                    journalists were trying to manufacture heroes for a hero-hungry public, Bo McMillin appeared to be
                    the genuine article. In 1921, before Bo was even out of college, Ralph Delahaye Paine, a popular
                    author of adolescent adventure and sports stories, wrote First Down 
                            Kentucky
                        , a story based on the exploits of Bo McMillin. It was an inspirational novel
                    in which its hero, Bowman McMurray (Bo McMillin), is wounded when a German torpedo hits his ship
                    during the Great War, still manages to save his shipmates, recovers from his serious injuries, and
                    returns to America to lead his small 
                        Kentucky
                     college to thrilling gridiron victories—all very stirring stuff for young
                    minds. That same year, the real  Bo, who had only served in the 
                        United States
                     Naval Reserves during the war, went Paine one better. On October 29, 1921, before
                    forty-five thousand spectators in 
                        Harvard
                    's stadium, Bo scored the only touchdown in Centre College's 6 to 0
                    upset of Harvard College, thus ending a Crimson winning streak that stretched back to 1916.
                    Reminiscing on the game fifty years later, the 
                        New York
                    
                    Times judged Centre's victory "football's upset of the
                    century."
            Charles W. Akers's and John W. Carter's Bo McMillin attempts to
                    separate man and legend—a difficult task considering that Bo consciously nursed and then
                    tried to live his own legend. As if their biographical assignment were not difficult enough, Akers
                    and Carter consider several other weighty issues. They maintain that McMillin's life
                    "offers a major illustration of the complex way in which football became an integrated
                    component of American society" (pp. xii-xiii). "Beyond the internal history of
                    football," they assert, "the life of this unique man raises and illuminates some
                    of the perennial questions about the place of sport in American society: the influence of coaches
                    over their players, athletics as a tool of colleges in attracting students and raising endowments,
                    the connection between sport and religion, society's need for heroes, and the symbiotic
                    relationship of the press to the athletic programs of schools" (p. xiii). This is a great
                    deal of ground to cover in a slim volume, but it is to the authors' credit that they at
                    least attempt to link McMillin's life to the larger issues that swirled around him.
            Bo's playing career is covered in the first third of the book and is an interesting story.
                    Here especially Akers and Carter do a fine job of separating fact from fancy. In Bo's
                    history of himself his life was a parable: a poverty-plagued, wild, criminal boyhood redeemed by the
                    saving graces of football. In fact, Bo was not as poor as he often indicated; nor was he as bad. But
                    football was important to him from the time he was an adolescent to the day he died. After a very
                    successful high school career in Fort Worth, 
                        Texas
                    , in 1917 at the age of twenty-two he enrolled at Centre College. A small Presbyterian
                    school, Centre prided itself on its fine academic program and its distinguished alumni. Perhaps Bo
                    was interested in becoming one of the latter, but he was certainly not interested in the benefits of
                    the former. Bo's total lack of interest in academics, however, did not seem to bother
                    either Centre's administration or faculty. President William A. Ganfield consciously used
                    football to raise Centre's enrollment and endowment. For the next five years, then, Centre
                    and Bo used each other to achieve their different but not mutually exclusive ends.
            It was at Centre that the essential Bo became evident; he became a classic hypocrite. As Akers and
                    Carter note, "the rigors of his boyhood had deeply embedded another strain in his
                    character, revealed in his urging others to study while neglecting his own  classes, in his remaining an inveterate gambler while eschewing other
                    vices…" (p. 50). Bo, who had spent several summers working on the Chautauqua
                    circuit, spoke with great passion about loyalty, duty, and sacrifice. But he did not live those
                    ideas. Rather, he was always in search of the next, best deal. He probably would have left Centre
                    before the famous Harvard game if a professional team would have offered him enough money. And as a
                    coach he jumped from one school to the next—from Centenary College to 
                        Geneva
                     College to 
                        Kansas
                     State Agricultural College to Indiana University and finally to 
                        Detroit
                     and 
                        Philadelphia
                     in the professional ranks.
            Throughout Bo McMillin Akers and Carter show Bo's strengths as well as his
                    weaknesses, his successes as well as his failures. But the authors do not fall under Bo's
                    legendary charm. The end result is a satisfying short biography. Particularly noteworthy is their
                    treatment of Bo's years as a player at Centre College and as a coach at Indiana University.
                    Although the book has no footnotes or bibliography, it appears to be based on interviews, newspapers
                    and magazine articles, and college and university archival records. Finally, Bo
                        McMillin is thoughtfully written.

            Frederick C. Luebke's latest contribution to the field of German-American and immigration
                    history is a collection of ten essays exploring aspects of immigration historiography and German
                    immigration to America and 
                        Brazil
                    . Luebke offers several reasons historians have until recently neglected German
                    immigration, including the vagueness of the label "German," the size and diversity
                    of this population, and the cultural amnesia brought on by two world wars. His essays suggest that
                    not only historians but also German-Americans themselves encountered these problems.
            The essays cover three major themes: polarization and conflict in 
                        Brazil
                    , assimilation and conflict in the 
                        United States
                    , and immigration historiography. The three Brazilian essays examine the history of
                    Germans in that country and the extreme repression they suffered during World War I, adding
                    comparisons to the situation in the 
                        United States
                    . The "Teuto-Brazilians" remained an isolated minority, a domestic
                    wartime target for the host society. In 
                        Brazil
                     the nightmare of the war included the total prohibition of any publication,
                    instruction, or public usage of the German language.
            
            The five American essays are centered on identity and assimilation. For German immigrants and their
                    children identity meant maintenance of their language and religious institutions. Luebke admits that
                    his "own interest in the history of Germans in America was originally generated by a desire
                    to understand the segment of immigrant society" from which he sprang (p. xiii). The
                    remaining essays in this theme examine the issues and failures of German-American leadership in the
                    political arena. Except for battling the Know Nothing threat of the 1850s, very few political causes
                    or issues, including Sabbatarianism, prohibition, women's suffrage, and restrictive school
                    legislation, united the large and diverse German immigrant group already divided by religion and
                    class. Catholics, Free Thinkers, Lutherans, and Pietists held "differing views about the
                    role of government in questions of morality" (p. 85). Luebke also analyzes the attitudes of
                    German-American voters and the frustration of ethnic leaders in the post-World War I period.
            Two of the essays discuss German-American and immigration historiography. Luebke chronologically
                    examines the development of immigration history from Frederick Jackson Turner through Oscar Handlin
                    to its current stage of "social analysis of ethnopolitical history" (p. xix),
                    which explores the relationships between ethnicity and class. "Three Centuries of Germans
                    in America" provides a brief synopsis of German-American history and traces the evolution
                    of the field, which was once awash in filiopietism and ethnic cultural chauvinism. In the last
                    twenty-five years, however, German-American history has come of age, borrowing methods from
                    sociologists, anthropologists, linguists, cultural geographers, and folklorists. Luebke concludes
                    that German ethnic behaviors and attitudes, unidentified or submerged, remain in
                    "middle-class America—especially in the states of the Midwest" (p.
                    180).
            The Midwest figures prominently in all but three of the essays. Conspicuously absent from the
                    excellent bibliography is Frances H. Ellis's work on German language instruction in the
                    public schools of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , published by this journal in 1954. Luebke is a pioneer in the field of German-American
                    studies; this volume is a valuable contribution to the field and to midwestern and immigration
                    history. He poses a number of questions that need to be addressed and can be answered using Indiana
                    subjects and sources. Indiana Germans are ripe for study and investigation.

                country stores and suburban malls, suffragists and civil rights
                    protesters—should skip this book. It is strictly for graduate students and professors of
                    history trying to keep abreast of the historiography of the Midwest. The book—really a
                    long essay—has a lofty title and a rather narrower focus. There is little analysis of the
                    multiple dimensions of regionalism as an analytic tool. The focus is narrowly on the economic basis
                    and ideological foundations of politics from 1800 to 1900, with considerable stress on the
                    territorial period. The approach is not behavioral (no voting statistics here, or statistics of any
                    sort), but rather postmodern cultural critique. Much is made of migration, industrialization,
                    communities, markets, labor unions, abolitionists, commercial elites, the idea of progress,
                    pluralism, and the tension between working-class and bourgeois culture. Every chapter excoriates
                    Frederick Jackson Turner and his notion that the Midwest was the seedbed for political democracy;
                    that myth was a rationalization created by a group that briefly controlled the region, the
                    entrepreneurs and bourgeois (very few of whom were French, despite the terminology).
            The authors lack an adequate theoretical framework to critique effectively the historians they
                    discuss. While they move beyond the old Progressive idea that economic interests cause political
                    behavior, they seem to believe that economic structure causes political behavior. They do not
                    discuss the weaknesses of that theory or show why it is more useful than the alternative notions
                    that cultural groups cause political behavior, or that shared political ideas supersede both
                    economic and cultural structures. Their exact beliefs are not always clear. They cite studies that
                    use the modernization paradigm but carefully avoid the term (modernization is currently not
                    "politically correct"). They refer to ethno-cultural groups but do not directly
                    challenge the ethnocultural model of political behavior. It is disconcerting indeed to encounter a
                    book of historiography that deliberately neglects every historian before 1970 (except for Turner),
                    thus leaving a false impression of  what is worth reading and
                    worth knowing. On the other hand, if the goal is to concentrate on recent ideas, it is a disservice
                    to the graduate student audience not to alert it to the highly influential behavioral theories of
                    political history that include the "
                        Michigan
                    " model, party systems, rational choice theory, retrospective voting, and
                    realignment/critical election theory. The authors' attempt to engage the historians of the
                    1970s and 1980s will trouble readers who have the old-fashioned view that history books ought to be
                    about the past.

               The Enduring Indians of 
                            Kansas
                        : A Century and a Half of Acculturation. By Joseph B. Herring. (

            Since H. Craig Miner's and William E. Unrau's The End of Indian 
                            Kansas
                        
                (1978), historians have published a surprising number of fine studies on the
                    Indians of 
                        Kansas
                    . The Enduring Indians of 
                            Kansas
                        
                continues the trend, especially complementing the Miner and Unrau volume and
                    the author's earlier biography of the Ver-million Kickapoo leader, Kenekuk. Joseph B.
                    Herring begins The Enduring Indians by tracing how the eastern Indians came to 
                        Kansas
                    . He notes that the first groups arrived soon after the War of 1812 and introduced
                    various elements of white culture, most notably disease and whiskey, to local tribes. The author
                    then deftly summarizes the Jacksonian removals that brought many more eastern Indians to 
                        Kansas
                     and the white expansion in the 1850s that resulted in a second removal of most groups
                    to Indian Territory.

                            Topeka
                        .
            
            The main body of Herring's book deals with the fate of the Kickapoos, Potawatomis,
                    Chippe-was, Munsees, Iowas, Sacs, and others who remained in 
                        Kansas
                     after the second removal. Although the various tribes responded differently to white
                    settlement, Herring argues that most "acculturated on their own terms" (p. 2). He
                    points out, for example, that removed Indians had already adapted many elements of Plains culture,
                    including buffalo hunting, tepees, and ceremonies. As white settlement developed, the Indians
                    shifted to taking local game, small-scale farming, sales of products, and day labor.
                    Herring's discussion indicates that white settlers were probably less a threat than
                    missionaries, federal officials, and corrupt Indian leaders. The strategy of adaptation brought
                    mixed results. After a long struggle, troops moved Mokohoko's band of Sacs to Indian
                    Territory. The Prairie Potawatomis avoided removal but submitted to land allotment. Whether
                    successful or unsuccessful, however, the 
                        Kansas
                     Indians avoided the catastrophe of armed resistance. In the final chapter, Herring
                    discusses continuing adaptations during the twentieth century. Although economic necessity after
                    1929 forced many to leave their communities for urban jobs, Herring emphasizes that 
                        Kansas
                     Indians still retain several cultural and religious practices.
            Herring's book deserves high marks on several counts. He organizes his material well, writes
                    clearly, and provides strong insights. His footnotes indicate a mastery of secondary sources and
                    sizable research in archival materials. Most impressive, Herring goes beyond the official aspects of
                    Indian-white relations and provides a good understanding of Indians' perceptions and
                    behavior as they responded to changes.
            Those interested in what happened to the native peoples of Indiana after their removal to 
                        Kansas
                     will find Herring's treatment very informative.

               Bull Threshers and Bindlestiffs: Harvesting and Threshing on the North American

                    , 1990. Pp. xiii, 248. Illustrations, figures, tables, notes, index. $29.95.)
            Thomas D. Isern has done it again. Just as his Custom Combining on the Great Plains
                    (1981) filled a significant gap in regional agricultural history, so this volume dealing with
                    harvesting "before the combine" fills another part of the engaging story of
                    technology, capital, labor, culture, and lore of the plains of the 
                        United States
                     and 
                        Canada
                    . Like the earlier study, this one is an admirable combination of thorough research,
                    finely crafted narrative, and instructive illustrations. It meets the standards of professional
                    historians and appeals to the larger public's abiding fascination with threshing machines.
            The history of harvesting technology and detailed explanations of how equipment was used, including
                    power and labor, provide the background for harvesting and threshing practices on the plains. Prior
                    to the development of the combine, which combined both tasks, harvesting referred
                    to the cutting of the crop and storing in shocks or stacks, and threshing was the separation of the
                    grain from the straw and chaff. Some readers, especially collectors and those who follow the
                    antique-threshing-show circuit, will wish for more specific details on name-brand equipment (which
                    is available in other places but could have been incorporated here). The later chapter on combines
                    provides more of this type of information for those machines than is included regarding earlier
                    binders, headers, separators, and engines.
            Isern is at his best when describing the workings of threshing crews and the variety of practices
                    related by participants. The division of labor and duties of everyone (including engineers,
                    separator men, water monkeys, firemen, drivers, bindlestiffs, grain  haulers, and cooks) are enhanced with stories and illustrations. The
                    details about the huge migratory labor force involved in harvesting and threshing on the plains
                    include workers, ethnic groups, recruiting, travel, wages, food, lodging, and labor organizations.
            Isern is a keen student of the Great Plains, and he provides regional interpretation that reaches
                    different conclusions than J. Sanford Rikoon's Threshing in the Midwest
                    (1988). Plains farmers and threshermen adapted readily to changing technology, at least in part
                    because of the chronic shortage of local laborers. The plains environment produced subregional
                    variations, such as winter wheat on the southern and central plains and spring wheat on the northern
                    plains, which affected equipment choices and harvesting practices, such as binders or headers. The
                    adoption of the combine on the Great Plains produced a revolution in wheat farming. Bull Threshers and Bindlestiffs stands alone as a scholarly study; it also provides
                    relevant background for the "sequel" that was published first, Custom
                        Combining on the Great Plains.

            This book, although impressive in many ways, delivers less than its title promises. It is a study of
                    the ecclesiastical politics of the American Home Missionary Society, one of the central elements of
                    the evangelical "Benevolent Empire" in the antebellum 
                        United States
                    , from the Old School-New School split among Presbyterians to the onset of the Civil
                    War. Conscience and Slavery is admirable in its extensive research and attention
                    to personalities and detail. But when Victor B. Howard attempts to explicate the significance of
                    these events in the context of the times, his central argument is less impressive.
            The outline of Howard's story is familiar to scholars of antislavery and American religion.
                    The American Home Missionary Society was one of the groups, composed largely of

                     Presbyterians and adherents farther west, that attempted to save the 
                        United States
                     from the rising tide of barbarism it perceived outside 
                        New England
                     and 
                        New York
                     after the War of 1812. Central to its mission was a post-millennial vision of reform in
                    which the Kingdom of God would dawn in the 
                        United States
                    . To that end, Christians had to take the  lead in
                    banishing sin from the land. From the 1830s onward, two groups struggled for control of the society,
                    one convinced that slavery was the worst of sins and thus had to be attacked as a sin while the
                    society broke all ties with slaveholders save as sinners to be converted, the other convinced that
                    antislavery had to be subordinated to missionary work in the South—missionary work in
                    which Christian slaveholders would play an important role. Howard shows how the abolitionist view
                    gradually came to prevail, reflecting, he argues, the conversion of the northern public to views of
                    a dangerous "Slave Power Conspiracy" that climaxed with the Republican victory in
                    the election of 1860 and the consequent secession of slave states.
            The strength of Howard's work lies in its massive research base, involving work in the
                    records of dozens of Presbyterian synods and presbyteries and Congregational associations, not to
                    mention an extensive reading of the church and secular press. He provides an impressive account of
                    the people and events that gradually moved certain evangelicals, including Presbyterians in Indiana,
                    toward an antislavery position. What many readers will find unconvincing is his interpretation of
                    the significance of these events, his insistence for example that "The action of
                    abolitionists in criticizing the northern church was less effective in purifying the moral outlook
                    of the northern church than it was in strengthening the proslavery stance of the southern
                    church" (p. 189). At best, Howard's argument that true Christians could have
                    resolved the problem of slavery through compromise is unconvincing after a generation of scholarship
                    on abolition and slavery to the contrary. Still, however, historians of abolition and American
                    religion can learn much from this book.

               Civil Wars: Women and the Crisis of Southern Nationalism. By George C. Rable. (

                    $29.95.)
            Scholars have generally ignored Mary Elizabeth Massey's call of nearly thirty years ago for
                    studies of the Civil War home front. Now George C. Rable's finely crafted volume casts new
                    light on the ways in which warfare transformed the lives of southern white women who both supported
                    and ultimately undermined southern nationalism and the war effort.
            Comprehensively quoting southern white women of all classes, Rable intensely dramatizes the heroism
                    and heartache they faced during the Civil War. He recreates this intensity with such persuasive  clarity and urgency that the reader almost hopes to encounter a
                    happier ending, even though despair prevails. Rable relies on traditional literary sources and
                    admits an elite bias in his examination of southern economic and social structure. The neglect of
                    African-American women from this analysis is unfortunate. Nevertheless, the amount of research is
                    voluminous; the analysis insightful. Even the notes are marvelous syntheses of the literature.
            From his first quote, about the safety and shelter of a woman's life, to his last, about the
                    hardship of factory life, Rable follows changes wrought on the home front. He investigates
                    women's reaction to their society's definitions of woman's place and the
                    extent to which the Civil War affected their social identity, their view of themselves, their world.
                    His interpretation of various of the war's paradoxes are discerning and astute. He
                    discusses, for instance, the dual role of religion as simultaneously encouraging female
                    submissiveness and public activity.
            Rable's description of class tensions among whites is a theme throughout the book.
                    Increasing social friction resulted when the wealthy used the legal and political process to their
                    own advantage. Yeomen were galled by the disparity of sacrifice. Rable concludes that families from
                    all economic classes were impoverished by the war, but that some of the wealthy continued to live
                    well and did not bear their fair share of the war effort. He also contends that historians have
                    erred in overemphasizing white women's antislavery sentiments, that their race and class
                    prevented any understanding of the slave's plight. He concludes that racism intensified as
                    slavery disintegrated. In a departure from white sources, Rable uses testimony from former slaves to
                    discuss white women's treatment of their slaves.
            Rable argues that plantation (and to a lesser extent, farming) women generally accepted their
                    assigned places in the economic, social, and familial order. He analyzes the few economic
                    opportunities for women and is a little too patronizing in his analysis that women preferred
                    security rather than "a harshly competitive economic and social order." One of the
                    opportunities open to women was nursing. Rable praises women's hospital work; in hospitals
                    run by women, the mortality rate (5 percent) was half that of hospitals run by men (10 percent
                    mortality).
            Rable finds that by mid-1862 survival outranked patriotism as a motivating factor. Letters to the
                    Confederate government discussed hunger, high prices, and shortages, and with the desperation of the
                    starving, women encouraged their menfolk to desert. Rable's portrayal of this quiet, angry
                    desperation is very moving.
            Rable summarizes that new demands on women were met differently by the many individuals affected, but
                    "most lived from day to day, much as their mothers and grandmothers had done, praying for
                    their families, perhaps hoping for better days, but seldom 
                    expecting miracles." He concludes that the dichotomy of continuity or change is too
                    simplistic, the Civil War wrought "Change without change" (p. 288).
                    Rable's book is an excellent overview of crucial issues: survival, the Confederate home
                    front, white women, patriarchy and paternalism, class tensions, patriotism, desertion, and more. It
                    is a must for anyone interested in Civil War history or the American South.

               Religion and the Radical Republican Movement, 1860–1870. By Victor B.
                    Howard. (
                        Lexington
                    : University Press of 
                        Kentucky
                    , 1990. Pp. x, 297. Notes, bibliography, index. $32.00.)
            The relationship between religion and politics during the Civil War era has only recently attracted
                    the attention of historians. Those who examine the southern experience have taken the topic with
                    great seriousness, as the works of James W. Silver, Samuel S. Hill, W. Harrison Daniel, and the
                    authors of Why the South Lost the Civil War demonstrate. Except for major
                    contributions by James Moorhead and John R. McKivigan, however, religion's role in northern
                    decision making has not been adequately treated. Fortunately, Victor B. Howard's study of
                    religious influences on Radical Republicanism helps fill that void.
            Howard's purpose is to analyze "the interplay of religion and politics"
                    (p. ix) during the war and its aftermath. He focuses on the church's involvement in
                    slavery, emancipation, and black suffrage, and especially on the manner in which the pulpit and the
                    sectarian press called on people "to carry their religion into politics" (p. 59).
                    Using an exceptional arsenal of primary sources, Howard points to the centrality of religion in the
                    shaping of Radical Republicanism. Indeed, northern Protestant churches, particularly those of
                    evangelical persuasion, were "the conscience of the Republican party" (p. 1); many
                    of that party's Radicals were prominent figures in the major denominations and joined their
                    clergy in espousing "pulpit politics" (p. 66). These Christians saw emancipation
                    as the essential step toward cleansing the nation of its most flagrant sin. Thus, with abolition and
                    black justice as their primary cause, they viewed the Civil War as a Christian jihad.
            
            In explaining precisely how radical Christians influenced northern decision making, Howard
                    investigates the church's role in the era's major issues. Particularly noteworthy
                    is his treatment of Christians' reactions to Abraham Lincoln's handling of the
                    emancipation question, including their chagrin over the president's repudiation of Generals
                    John C. Frémont and David Hunter for their premature proclamations in 
                        Missouri
                     and the Department of  the South. Likewise,
                    Howard's analyses of the church's role in the adoption of constitutional
                    amendments and of the Johnson impeachment proceedings are insightful.
            The author has mined the field well, uncovering an impressive array of sources. It is unfortunate,
                    then, that the book contains some questionable and often inadequately supported conclusions.
                    Frequently, Howard assumes that a politician's connection with a specific religious
                    tradition is satisfactory evidence for designating him a "radical Christian." For
                    instance, Benjamin Wade fits the category because he "traveled in religious
                    circles" (p. 17), while General Hunter belongs since he was a Presbyterian whose father was
                    an army chaplain (p. 28). These, and many other examples, cause the reader to wonder whether mere
                    affiliation is ample proof that a politician's voting record or rhetoric directly flowed
                    from religion. Furthermore, numerous conclusions lack solid support, such as Howard's
                    statements that "radical Christian sentiment… was overwhelming in its
                    intensity" in prompting Lincoln to sign the Emancipation Proclamation (p. 50) and that
                    conservatives seceded from northwestern churches because of "the
                    fierceness and passion" of radical evangelical views (pp. 66–67). Finally, the
                    book suffers from a rather tedious and encyclopedic style, with quotes from clergy, conventions, and
                    journals being strung together in a seemingly endless pattern.
            Yet, Howard has done yeoman's work in this book, unearthing material upon which further
                    studies can be undertaken; this alone makes it a priceless contribution to one's knowledge
                    of religion's political role during the nation's greatest crisis.

               American Narrow Gauge Railroads. By George W. Hilton. (
                  Stanford, Calif.
               : Stanford University Press, 1990. Pp. xiii, 580. Maps, Illustrations,
                    notes, tables, index. $60,00.)
            A major contribution to railroad history, George W. Hilton's work incisively examines and
                    analyzes an important phase that most rail historians have overlooked. Because standard gauge of 4
                    feet 8½ inches is now universal, it will amaze many to learn that narrow gauge, mostly 3
                    feet, was significant in the nation's rail development. These lines spread through
                    forty-four states and totaled 18,529 miles and accounted for as much as 35 percent of new mileage in
                    the peak year. Ultimately most were converted or abandoned.
            Hilton's book, which is divided into two sections, first digs deeply into narrow gauge
                    origins in 
                        England
                     and supports the legend  that standard gauge by
                    happenstance duplicated the distance between Roman chariot wheels. An economist, Hilton discusses in
                    depth the slim gauge movement and the lengthy, complex cost controversy that surrounded it.
                    Proponents claimed construction savings and lower operating and financing costs. Opponents,
                    meanwhile, countered that savings were minimal—that more trains were required because of
                    smaller capacity cars, which translated into higher train crew expense. They also maintained that
                    costs of transshipment to the proliferating standard gauge network minimized any savings. Hilton
                    examines the narrow gauge fever that resulted in two national conventions and traces the
                    movement's lingering death following collapse of the Grand Narrow Gauge Trunk in 1883 after
                    it had nearly completed a line from 
                  Toledo, Ohio
               , to 
                        Laredo
                    , 
                        Texas
                    , on the Mexican border. Other chapters deal with locomotives, cars, physical plant, the
                    incompatability problem, and industry decline. Each reflects exhaustive research, well-organized
                    writing, and knowledgable interpretation. The second half of the book, an incomparable resource,
                    lists a biography of every known company, arranged by states.
            Indiana had strong ties to the narrow gauge industry. Hilton credits Colonel Edward Hulbert, who
                    managed a southern Indiana road and retired to a 
                        Pike County
                     farm, as one of two men responsible for the movement's strength in America.
                    Indiana's six lines included the 
                        Toledo
                    -
                        Frankfort
                    -
                        St. Louis
                     road that became the Norfolk and Western, a section of the Monon (now CSX) between
                    Rennselaer and Delphi, and, strangely, a nine-mile 
                        Huntington
                    -Markle predecessor of the Erie, which began as a six-foot gauge. The 
                        Toledo
                    -
                        Frankfort
                     line, part of the Grand Narrow Gauge Trunk, made history in 1887 when the 206 miles
                    east of 
                        St. Louis
                     were converted in ten hours.
            Hilton's book, done to high research, organization, and printing standards, is a monumental
                    work in its field.

            The eleven essays in this volume stem from a three-year project entitled "Re-Visioning
                    America: Religion and the Life of the Nation," funded by the Lilly Endowment and
                    cosponsored by the Department of Religious Studies and the Center for American Studies of Indiana
                    University, 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Editor Rowland A. Sherrill has added an introduction that urges the reader to
                    recognize  the inextricable entanglement of religion and culture
                    and to search for what seems to be an almost Tillichian "dimension of depth" in
                    all cultural expressions.
            As is usually the case in such collections, the authors gamely fit the results of their research on
                    particular people, movements, or issues to the overall theme, but the essays will be of interest
                    chiefly to students of those people, movements, or issues. For this reason, a review can best serve
                    potential readers by describing the individual pieces, which are organized in reverse chronological
                    order.
            To begin, Edward Linenthal demonstrates how, in responding to the possibilities of nuclear war and
                    nuclear disarmament, both the Committee on Present Danger on the right and the Physicians for Social
                    Responsibility on the left felt compelled to go beyond secular arguments by constructing a
                    mythological appeal to American exceptionalism. Albert Raboteau then describes Martin Luther King,
                    Jr.'s progression from a position that insisted on American exceptionalism to a stance that
                    called for "allegiances and loyalties … which go beyond our nation's
                    self-defined goals …" (p. 60). Charles Reagan Wilson argues that the distinctive
                    civil religion of the South can contribute to the transformation of American civil religion recently
                    called for by Robert Bellah. Ronald Delattre offers an insightful account of "supply-side
                    spirituality" and its relation to the culture of abundance that gave it birth. L. Shannon
                    Jung contends that the traditional Judeo-Christian "stewardship ethic" could not
                    resist the forces that led American agriculture to become American agribusiness. Joel
                    Carpenter's account of the rise of Youth for Christ in the late 1940s demonstrates how
                    evangelicals had to compromise their distinctive theological positions in order to gain acceptance
                    in American public life. Jonathan Sarna perceptively describes the frustrations encountered by both
                    "accommodationist" and "rejectionist" Jews in distinguishing the
                    Christmas of American civil religion from the Christmas of Christians. Taking his cue from Alexis de
                    Tocqueville and Bellah, John Roth explores the concept of individualism in George Santayana,
                    Reinhold Niebuhr, and John Dewey. Richard Hughes traces the fortunes of
                    restorationism—the effort "to recover the primordial past that stood behind the
                    historical past" (p. 194)—in nineteenth-century America. Amanda Porterfield
                    argues that the story of the Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenkswatawa teaches people to distinguish
                    between a constructive reliance on mythic vision to shape political reality and a destructive
                    reliance on supernatural power to solve political problems. Finally, James Moseley invites scholars
                    to see in John Winthrop's Journal the prototypical development of
                    "a new, more characteristically American religiousness" (p. 239).
            BAIRD TIPSON, provost and professor of religion at 
                        Gettysburg
                     College, Gettysburg, 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , is working on a study of Samuel Stone's "Whole Body of
                    Divinity," the first Protestant systematic theology written in North America.
         
         
         
            News from the Indiana State Archives
            State Archivist F. Gerald Handfield, Jr., director of the Commission on Public Records, reorganized
                    the commission into four consolidated divisions during 1990. The State Archives and Records Center,
                    headed by Justin E. Walsh, constitutes one division. Forms Management and Records Management
                    constitute another, known as the Records Systems Design division and headed by Ron Terry. The
                    Conservation Lab and Micrographics constitute a third, the new Records Preservation division, headed
                    by Deputy-Director Marta O'Neill. A fourth division, the new Records Automation and
                    Innovation Lab (GRAIL), is headed by Sam Helm. This division will coordinate automation of the
                    commission and formulate a statewide strategy for the use of optical disks to improve records
                    administration for all levels of state and local government in Indiana. The GRAIL office is also
                    spearheading an interagency Paperwork Reduction Task Force for the office of Governor Evan Bayh.
            Recent acquisitions of the State Archives include:
            RECORDS OF THE INDIANA SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND, 1847–1947; 70 cubic feet; unrestricted
                    access; finding aid being prepared.
            This is one of the most significant collections acquired in 1990. The records date from the opening
                    of the school in 1847 and include minutes, pupil registers, financial ledgers, and instructional
                    materials. The collection also includes sixty bound volumes comprising a nearly complete set of
                    annual reports from institutions for the blind throughout the 
                        United States
                    . These date from the beginning of the formation of benevolent institutions in the 1840s
                    through 1905. Taken together, the two parts of the collection provide a rich resource for research
                    on nineteenth-century policy toward the visually handicapped, not only in Indiana but nationwide.
            STATE FAIR COLLECTION, 1890–1960s; 50 cubic feet; unrestricted access except motion
                    picture film; itemized inventory of blueprints and photographs.
            This extensive collection includes minutes of the Indiana State Fair Board, financial records, more
                    than three hundred blueprints of buildings on the state fairgounds, plus programs, premium lists,
                    and scrapbooks. A rich collection of photographs and motion picture film dating from the 1920s
                    through the 1950s documents the history of the fair.

                    required that county clerks "shall record the name, age, description, place of birth and
                    residence" of all African-American residents for the purpose of prohibiting further black
                    settlement in Indiana. The
