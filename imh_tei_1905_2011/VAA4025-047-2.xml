            <head>Historical Background of the Restrictions Against State Debt in the Indiana Constitution of 1851</head>
            <byline>Donald F. Cannony∗</byline>
            <p>One of the more significant provisions of the present constitution of Indiana is Section 5 of Article
                    10: "No law shall authorize any debt to be contracted, on behalf of the State, except in
                    the following cases: To meet casual deficits in the revenue; to pay interest on the State debt; to
                    repel invasion, suppress insurrection, or, if hostilities be threatened, provide for public
                        defense."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These restrictions are probably unwise but their inclusion in the Constitution of 1851 stemmed
                    directly from Indiana's experience with the Internal Improvements System of 1836 and the
                    catastrophic fiscal consequences which resulted therefrom. Such limitations on state legislatures
                    are characteristic of the state constitutions formed at mid-century under the spell of Jacksonian
                        Democracy.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Indiana's experience with her internal improvements

            <p>We are conditioned to thinking in terms of millions of dollars when viewing state finances and of
                    billions when considering federal revenues and expenditures. This makes it almost impossible for us
                    to comprehend the limited expenditures and revenues required to support the territorial and early
                    state government. The total cost of the territorial government, during the sixteen years from its
                    establishment, in 1800, until statehood in 1816, averaged less than ten thousand dollars yearly and
                    approximately two-thirds of this amount was provided directly from the federal treasury.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> During the first decade of statehood it cost about twenty-five thousand
                    dollars annually to operate the state government, while the average yearly cost increased to about
                    one hundred twenty thousand dollars by the mid-thirties, including expenditures arising from the
                    sales of land received from the federal government as subsidies for various purposes. The annual
                    reports of the state treasurer have not been carefully analyzed and tabulated for the mid-thirties
                    but it is roughly estimated that the "ordinary" expenses of the state government
                    which were provided by landholders and citizens of the state did not exceed a maximum of
                    seventy-five thousand dollars annually.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> The preceding totals and estimates for
                    territorial and state expenditures do not include the costs arising from local government.</p>
            <p>These very limited expenditures are merely an index of the meager economic, political, and social
                    resources of frontier Indiana. Indiana was a debtor area and its people were engaged in the
                    laborious and exhausting task of conquering their physical environment. Further explanations <list type="footnotes">

                    low price level, the meager population and the fact that the role of government was in accordance
                    with the laissez-faire traditions of Adam Smith and Thomas Jefferson. From the establishment of
                    Indiana as a separate territory in 1800 until the adoption of the Internal Improvements System in
                    1836, Hoosier revenue payers provided considerably less than one million dollars to finance the
                    territorial and state government. Direct appropriations from the federal treasury and liberal
                    subsidies through land grants loomed large in the fiscal affairs of the frontier commonwealth. New
                    Dealers increased and made new uses of federal subsidies; however, federal subsidies were gratefully
                    accepted by the early Hoosiers who often complained that the federal government could and should do
                    more to foster and support internal improvements and other desirable projects for improving their
                    economic status.</p>
            <p>If the expenditures for internal improvements be measured against this background, and with general
                    regard to frontier conditions, their magnitude becomes apparent. To understand the internal
                    improvements muddle and the resulting constitutional restrictions against state debt we must look
                    back from 1851. Comparison with our present state finances will blind us to the realities and
                    limitations of the half century preceding the adoption of the 1851 constitution. Historians continue
                    to argue whether history really teaches men anything; certainly the debt restriction section of our
                    constitution is ample evidence that historical experience at least greatly influences human conduct
                    and policy.</p>
            <p>The frontier faced many problems. Perhaps the basic economic problem was that of transportation.
                    Until arteries of transportation could be developed it would not be possible to exchange the surplus
                    produce of the soil for imports or dollars necessary to pay for land, establish business, support
                    government, build roads and canals, raise the standard of living and bring about gradual improvement
                    in the social and cultural life of the pioneers. It was natural that an isolated and debtor society
                    should bend its efforts toward solving the all-important transportation problem.</p>
            <p>Under these circumstances the attempts to improve conditions of transportation were perhaps discussed
                    with as much interest and intensity during the two decades between 1816 <pb n="132" id="VAA4025-047-2-008"/> and 1836 as any other subject in any two decades of our history as a
                    state. Every message of every governor during this period mentioned internal improvements.
                    Committees of the assembly studied the problem and made numerous reports with increasing vigor and
                    enthusiasm in the 1830's. Newspapers included many articles concerning the need for the
                    improvement of river travel, for better roads through the forest, for better methods of road
                    building, and watched with interest and growing absorption the building of canals, roads, and
                    railroads in other states. The pro and con of railroads versus canals was debated and as the
                    internal improvements movement gained momentum it swept the Hoosiers with greater intensity and with
                    more permanent effects than some of the agues and fevers which took a heavy toll among the pioneers.</p>
            <p>It was generally agreed that something should be done and for years they talked about "the
                    system," and although there was <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s American System, the movement for a system of common schools, and other
                    "systems" yet "the system" meant internal improvements by the
                    1830's as clearly as "the revolution" means the revolution of the
                    1790's to a Frenchman. But how could a debtor society which lacked available funds provide
                    such a system and what would be the results of the proposed system? Some thought that the federal
                    government should build at least the national arteries for river and land travel but the policy of
                    Andrew Jackson in the early 1830's made it necessary for the states to assume primary
                    obligations for building internal improvements if such were to be provided by governmental action.
                    Even so it took some time for Hoosiers, even some of the Democratic leaders, to realize that
                    appropriations from the federal treasury for improvement of the "noble <placeName>

                    </placeName>" were also scheduled for the discard so far as Old Hickory was concerned.
                    During the twenties the federal government started the National Road across Indiana, approved a
                    grant of land to build a road from the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and made a liberal grant of land to finance the building of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie Canal. The latter was expected to provide continuous navigation from the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> through Lake Erie and thence by way of the Erie Canal down the Hudson to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Meanwhile, Indiana opened many highways for land travel, assisted by the three per
                    cent fund received <pb n="133" id="VAA4025-047-2-009"/> from the federal government. River traffic
                    via flatboat, keel-boats, and steamboats was of great importance but the flat-boat trade took
                    Indiana's surplus to the southern markets. The "system" was designed to
                    connect Indiana with eastern markets where prices were higher and a better selection of goods could
                    be exchanged for the products of the soil.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>The next year Governor James B. Ray gave much consideration to internal improvements in his annual
                    message and in his grandiloquent and flowery style pointed to the outlet through Lake Erie as the
                    best "to reduce western produce into money." The governor predicted that Indiana
                    would sustain a population of ten million and shortly Indiana's granary would be
                    overflowing and wasting for lack of a market outside the state. Indicating an awareness of the vital
                    role of transportation Ray continued: "It is evident that the settlers of a new country,
                    must be subjected to many privations and a heavy indirect tax, imposed upon them by the rude
                    deformity of surrounding nature… . Although this kind of a tax [transportation costs]
                    exceeds ten times the amount which is yearly paid for the support of the government, yet it appears
                    that it has escaped with less consideration, and more indifference… . <hi rend="i">The
                        rough appearances of nature, must be overcome, and made to yield to human enter-prize. Our
                        waters must be imprisoned in new channels, and made to subserve the essential purposes of
                        commerce."</hi> In concluding the governor exhorted: "Whilst our sisters
                    around us are rearing eternal monuments of their energies and public spirit, we have looked and
                    admired, but have been too timid to imitate ! ! !" In spite of this florid oratory the
                    governor was cautious about recommending specific steps to be taken but did urge that further
                    attention be given to the improvement of the roads.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    which would flow from appropriate use of public credit: "Since the beneficial policy of
                    engaging in public works for the advancement of the agricultural and commercial interests of the
                    country has been so frequently and clearly demonstrated, and while our credit is justly such as to
                    command any amount of capital at an interest of five per cent, or less, no good reason can be
                    assigned why we should longer hesitate to follow the successful examples of other States.

                    out the differences between the bills which had passed their respective houses, gleefully announced:

                    The only cause of regret … is the fact that a respectable portion of the members of both
                    houses … felt constrained to vote against the bill on the ground that equal benefits are
                    not extended to the whole state." The <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> then prophesied:

                    that soon the tolls and receipts would provide the state with revenue for all purposes. Few people
                    seemed to note that the young state had voted itself a program far beyond its means."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whigs and Democrats vied for popular favor in their support of the system. During the ensuing annual
                    session of the legislature some in both parties made strenuous efforts to broaden the system to
                    include some neglected parts of the state. When failure came, and the inability to pay principal or
                    interest haunted the taxpayers, the Democrats made effective efforts to blame the Whigs for the
                    financial ruin which existed in stark contrast to the promised arteries of commerce with revenues
                    therefrom sufficient to provide for upkeep, payment of debt, and perhaps even allow a surplus for
                    ordinary state expenditures.</p>
            <p>Possibly the most effective pen among the Democratic editors in the 1840's was that of E. W.
                    H. Ellis, editor of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Democrat.</hi> Ellis reviewed the flattering promises of improvements past local doors
                    to transport produce and roll back a tide of wealth. Ellis was partisan as he poured forth his
                    satire against the Whigs: "But what have we instead? Half-finished canals, which will not
                    pay for keeping themselves in repair—detached portions of
                    railroads—dilapidated bridges—here and there a straggling frog pond, whose
                    dismal echoes seem to forebode the wreck and ruin of which they are the monuments; and these are the
                    riches of Indiana!" Editor Ellis pinned the responsibility upon the Whigs, and with his eye
                    toward the state elections for the ensuing August, asked: "CHANGE! CHANGE! Is it not time
                    for a change? Can our situation not be bettered?—Of what use is it to plod on in the old
                    beaten path, and sink deeper at every step into the yawning gulf of ruin. For twelve long years have
                    the Whig party had possession of Indiana. They found her in her virgin beauty, the pride of the
                    Western forests. Her hardy yeomanry were free and independent. Her rich soil teemed with valuable
                    products, and the husbandman received a rich reward from her toil. But they beggared

            <p>The failure of the system and the resentment of the electorate was the most important single factor
                    leading to the landslide victory of the Democrats in the election of a governor and state assembly
                    in 1843. The stigma attached to the failure of the internal improvements system was a basic reason
                    the Whigs never regained political control in Indiana.</p>
            <p>During 1846 and again in 1847, approximately a decade after the system had been adopted and
                    commenced, the assembly approved legislation which brought about an understanding with the

                    due. A definite plan was arranged for payment of principal and interest on the remaining debt. It
                    was a compromise arrangement which salvaged as much for the creditors as it appeared possible to
                    secure and made it possible for the state to begin the long process of debt liquidation.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Some creditors were dissatisfied with the arrangement but they either agreed
                    or were forced to make the best of the legislation. Eventually in 1873 a constitutional amendment
                    was adopted to make certain that no further claims be paid except as agreed to in the <placeName>

            <p>In 1849 there was a constitutional referendum regarding a proposed convention to revise the
                    constitution. In the agitation arising over this referendum many, both Democrats and Whigs, insisted
                    that if a new constitution be framed there must be strict limitation against another state debt.

                    by vote of the people. Colfax explained: "The past history of our State is the best

            <p>In the election of delegates there was common agreement that provision should be made which would
                    prohibit another state debt for internal improvements and allied purposes. By this time it was
                    rather common to blame the legislature for the internal improvements debt and a number of delegates
                    took the doubtful position that there would have been no fiscal debacle had the legislature not
                    deceived and misled the people. Politicians who follow the will of the people are often blamed by
                    the electorate if that which is done backfires!</p>
            <p>A few quotes from the discussion in the constitutional convention of 1850-1851 will show the
                    atmosphere in which the debt restriction section was adopted. The atmosphere is in extreme contrast
                    to the optimistic and bouyant spirit which pervaded the utterances of political leaders in the
                    mid-thirties.</p>
            <p>Daniel Read, a professor at Indiana University and a Jacksonian Democrat, not only wanted to make it
                    impossible for the assembly again to make such generous use of the state's credit, he also
                    wanted to make certain that thereafter business be in private hands and not in the bungling and
                    wasteful hands of the state. Read stressed: "If there is a single proposition settled
                    beyond all manner of controversy, by every principle of sound reason, by experience all over the
                    world, and more especially by experience of our American States, it is this, that government should
                    not in its own capacity, nor by a partnership with individuals, become an agent in business
                    operations, except so far as required for the mere purposes of government." Turning to
                    Indiana, Read stated: "In the grand aggregate of State indebtedness, Indiana comes in for
                    her full proportion. No less than twelve millions fell to her lot; an amount equal to a twelfth part
                    of all the present taxable wealth of the State, and, at the time it was contracted, equal to an
                    eighth of it. After that terrific crash of State credit, which broke upon the country, in which
                    public and private credit was prostrated, and individuals and communities were alike overwhelmed,
                    had in some measure passed off, men began to reflect and soberly inquire what can be done to prevent
                    similar ruin in the future.</p>
            <p>"The great remedy which has been devised, is so to change the State Constitutions as to take
                    away from the Legislatures the power again to involve the State credit. Mainly with a view to
                    provisions of this kind, State after <pb n="140" id="VAA4025-047-2-016"/> State has changed its
                    Constitution, and other States are now engaged in the work." Read was in favor of cutting
                    "Off all power to create State debt, except in the case of public defense."
                    Moreover, "Public debt is a hydra-headed monster, which is always springing forth in some
                    new form, and under some new pretext. Cut it off in the nation,—straitway, it shoots
                    forth in the States—cut it off in the States—it comes forth in the
                    counties—cut it off in the counties—and it steals forth in the form of town or
                    city bonds."<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Delegate Colfax wanted to make the constitutional restriction as definite as possible, explaining:
                    "When we look back upon the scenes of excitement through which our State has
                    passed—when we remember that so enthusiastic were the people in favor of the mammoth
                    system, that they would as heartily and as strongly, and as overwhelmingly have voted for its
                    adoption at the polls, as did their Representatives in the Legislature, it does seem as if, now in
                    our cooler moments, with the results of that infatuation in full view before us, we should so act as
                    to prevent, if possible, their repetition. Let us resolve, and place it in this instrument beyond
                    repeal, that no more State debt shall hereafter be created upon any pretext whatever… .</p>
            <p>"And, as we have suffered more than other States from the results of imprudent debt, which
                    still hangs over us, impairing our prosperity, and impeding our progress and advancement as a State,
                    let Indiana be the pioneer in the adoption of this new Constitutional principle, and become, in this
                    respect, a model for others to follow."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some delegates wanted to restrict the legislature but allow a popular referendum to make the final
                    decision regarding the creation of a state debt, but Robert Dale Owen, son of the founder of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, agreed with Colfax that this would not have prevented the financial disaster arising
                    from the internal improvements system. Delegate Owen stated his views: "Few men have more
                    confidence in the people than I; but it is not my opinion that the people never decide wrong.
                    Unquestionably they do sometimes. In 1796 the people rejected Thomas Jefferson as President, and

                    They could not very well have been right in both cases.</p>

                    confidence; but they are often impulsive, and sometimes mistaken, as may happen to each one of us.
                    In a time of excitement they may do, in haste, that of which they will repent at leisure. This would
                    be assuredly the case, if the people were ever again to involve the State in an enormous public
                    debt, for the prosecution of a system of internal improvements." According to the debates a
                    voice interrupted Owen asking him to name things which the people have no right to do. Owen
                    answered: "One generation of men have no right to impose burdens upon the succeeding. One
                    generation of men have no moral right to contract a public debt so vast that the next generation,
                    and perhaps that which follows it, shall be loaded down with taxes, to discharge the interest and
                    repay the capital. They may, indeed, do this thing. They may obtain the money and spend it. Many
                    States and nations have done so. But it is not morally right on that account. Wherever it has been
                    done, it has been done wrongfully."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

            <p>Many quotations could be mustered from the two thick volumes of debates which record the
                    deliberations of the delegates to the constitutional convention of 1850-1851. Various shades of
                    opinions were presented but there was a substantial majority who supported severe restrictions
                    against state indebtedness. John Pettit, a delegate who believed it would be mockery for the
                    legislature to "draft laws and submit them for adoption by the people at the annual
                    election," reviewed Indiana's plight and urged constitutional restrictions against
                    state debt as the remedy: "I am utterly opposed to the creating of a public debt which was
                    contracted under an excitement unparalelled in the history of the country. … By producing
                    a state of feverish excitement, a measure can be carried at the polls, for borrowing any amount of
                    money. I am for restriction. A burnt child dreads the fire—and this State has been most
                    dreadfully burned in this regard. What is the position of Indiana to-day… . She has no
                    name except for an almost abandoned public faith and ruined public credit. She has walked to the
                    brink of repudiation and lasting disgrace.</p>

            <p>"Instead, then, of allowing any opportunity for a future Legislature to contract another

                    shape; redeem the honor of the State, free her from the disgrace abroad and the embarrassment at

            <p>In 1851 the new constitution was submitted to the people at a popular referendum and overwhelmingly
                        approved.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> The restrictions against state debt were generally considered as
                    desirable and wise. In an address to the people, authorized by the convention and distributed among
                    the voters during the ratification contest, the restrictions against public debt were reviewed and
                    the comment made: "Had this provision, brief and simple as it is, been inserted in the
                    Constitution of 1816, it would have saved the State from a loss of six millions of dollars. Upon
                    that sum we are now paying, without any return, some three hundred thousand dollars of interest
                    annually; that is, about eight hundred dollars a day; more than enough to maintain in perpetual
                    session … such a Convention as that which has been engaged, for the last four months, in
                    framing a constitution, which shuts out for the future, all possibility of similar
                        folly."<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No doubt we will generally agree that in the long run the political ability and maturity of a people,
                    or lack of the same, are more basic in the struggle for successful government than mere
                    constitutional restrictions. In any event it is abundantly clear that it was the catastrophic fiscal
                    consequences arising from the System of 1836 which directly caused the rigid restrictions against
                    state debt in our present constitution.</p>

                    west in search of the river. His fund of information in 1669 is summed up in these words:
                    "They [the Indians] told him that this river rose three days' journey from
                    Sonnontouan [a Seneca village] and that after a month's travel one found the
                    Honniasontkeronons and the Chiouanons, and that after passing the latter and a great cataract or
                    waterfall which is in this river, one found the Outagame and the country of the Iskousogos, and
                    finally a country so abundant in roedeer and wild cattle that they were as thick as the woods, and
                    so great a quantity of tribes that there could be no more."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                    Furthermore, the reports of the Indians led LaSalle to believe that if this river were followed for
                    seven or eight months it would lead an explorer to the sea.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the head of a party of fourteen organized at his own expense, LaSalle joined forces with two
                    priests, Dollier and Galinée, who were planning a missionary expedition up the St.
                    Lawrence. The two groups traveled together until they reached the western end of <placeName>

                    </placeName> country in the upper Great Lakes region. Because LaSalle of course had no desire to
                    accompany them in that direction, the party separated into its component elements on October 1,
                    1669. What LaSalle's activities were after he left Dollier and Galinée is matter
                    for conjecture,. since he disappears from the recital of the expedition at this point, with an
                    indication that he was planning to return to Montreal. But other documents exist which, in attempts
                    to explain his subsequent whereabouts from 1669 to 1673, tell of his supposed discovery of the <placeName>

                    Montreal, beyond all the French habitations. In the year 1667 and the following, he made several
                    journeys with much expense, in which he was the first to discover much country to the south of the
                    great lakes, among others the great river <placeName>

                    latitude of 37 degrees, after having been enlarged by another very great river which comes from the
                    north; and all these waters empty, according to all appearances, in the Gulf of Mexico, and make him

                    1683. In part, the author of the account states: "Meanwhile M. de la Salle continued his
                    way on a river which flows from the east to the west and passes to Onontague, then to six or seven
                    leagues below Lake Erie, and having come to the 280th or 83rd degree of longtitude, and to the 41st
                    degree of latitude, found a cataract which falls to the west in a low, marshy country all covered
                    with old stumps, some of which are still standing. He was then forced to land, and following a ridge
                    which could lead him far he found some savages who told him that, very far from there, the same
                    river which lost itself in this low, vast land reunited in a single bed. He accordingly continued
                    his way, but since the hardship was great, 23 or 24 men whom he had led up to that time all left him
                    one night, regained the river and <list type="footnotes">

                    reascending the river and living from the hunt, from herbs and from what the savages whom he met on

            <p>Another document which might conceivably relate to the problem is a letter written by
                    LaSalle's niece in January, 1746, a time when the French were interested in establishing
                    control over the headwaters of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. The letter, however, is not at all definite: "As soon as your letter was
                    received, I sought a sure opportunity to send you the papers of M. de La Salle. There are some maps
                    which I have added to these papers which should serve to prove that, in 1675, M. de la Salle had
                    already made two journeys in these discoveries, since there was a map which I am sending you, by
                    which mention is made of the place at which M. de La Salle approached the river <placeName>

                    river St. Lawrence in another place."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These three records comprise the bases for positive arguments. Proceeding to arguments from the
                    negative, a number of documents can be mentioned. In the first place, the only pertinent references
                    to be found in the letters of the current intendant, Talon, merely indicate that LaSalle was
                    exploring somewhere in the south, but not necessarily on this particular expedition, since they are
                    dated in the 1670's.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Secondly, when LaSalle wanted to go to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> in 1674, Frontenac wrote a letter of recommendation which praised LaSalle highly but
                    which mentioned no discoveries.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Thirdly, LaSalle's patent of
                    nobility, issued in March of the next year, briefly recorded his exploits as "scorning the
                    greatest perils in order to extend our name and our empire to the end of this New

                    called the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Here he declared that the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> was one of the branches of the Chucagoa,<hi rend="sup">19</hi> and then he added the
                    significant comment: "I have not yet been able to descend it"; the reference seems to be to
                    the Chucagoa. Later in the account he remarked that he did not know whether or not the Chucagoa fell
                    into the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>

                    fragment is apparently an attempt by LaSalle to prove that another large stream flowed to the

                    that LaSalle came down the river during flood time—but in that case the rapids would not

                    finally, the dates in the passage are not accurate.</p>
            <p>In considering the second passage, the account of the friend of the Abbé de
                    Galinée, new questions arise. This recital states that LaSalle explored from the 330th
                    degree of longitude to the 268th, and from the 55th degree of latitude to the 36th. Latitude 36
                    passes approximately through <placeName>

               </placeName>; 55° crosses central Alberta and
                    Saskatchewan, cutting off James Bay from Hudson Bay. But the question of longitude is more confusing
                    than that of latitude, for it is not known whether the measurements were made from Ferro, the
                    westernmost island of the Canaries, or from another point. Delanglez thought that Ferro was not the
                    prime meridian, since—according to him—it was not used as such until the
                    eighteenth century.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Yet Erwin Raisz in his <hi rend="i">General

                    western Canaries. On the basis of Ferro, the territory measured by the longitude recorded above
                    corresponds to the region from a point somewhere in the ocean east of Newfoundland westward to
                    110°, which passes through <placeName>

                    latitude, co-ordinates which on Hennepin's map are approximately the site of

                    deserted, for LaSalle himself had hired only about fourteen, some of whom seem to have returned to

                    </placeName>—he did not mention a falls or rapids, a fact which is totally at variance
                    with the documents already discussed, wherein appear references to a high falls. Furthermore, it is
                    not necessary to put a great deal of faith in the phrase, "which I have found,"
                    for in another letter LaSalle made a similar claim; he then proceeded to describe a river which does
                    not exist. He wrote: "I have found a route more convenient that that of the
                    lakes… .</p>

                    considerable, communication is more difficult, but about a day's journey from its mouth in

                    is changed into a river by juncture with a number of similar streams, which, after a course of more
                    than a hundred leagues without rapids receives another little river which comes from nearby, that of

                    rather than on actual exploration. The survival of such an example of downright falsification on the
                    part of LaSalle certainly should be kept in mind in trying to evaluate his exploits elsewhere!</p>
            <p>Secondly, in the fragment written two or more years later, while he was describing the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    confessed ignorance about the lower course of the Chucagoa. Yet in so doing he certainly contradicts
                    the definite wording of the official report of March 13 and 14, 1682, which recorded his taking

                    men made any reference at all to a previous connection of LaSalle with the stream; and neither do

            <p>Oftentimes the deficiencies of evidence derived from documents can be supplemented by cartographical
                    data. Unfortunately, however, existing maps pertinent to the issue do not offer much help. According
                    to Father Delanglez, Jolliet's maps which have not been changed at a later date do not
                    indicate that LaSalle had explored the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. He thought that the maps which have been changed to indicate such a discovery,
                    apparently in the early 1680's, are open to question. Furthermore, Delanglez pointed out
                    that later reproductions of Jolliet's maps, made in the late 1680's, again omit
                    reference to LaSalle on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> On the other hand, Beverley Bond decided that the alterations on
                    the maps support the authenticity of the supposed explorations.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One possible solution, based on Franquelin's Map of 1684, does present itself. This map
                    shows a stream, corresponding roughly to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, labeled <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> or Chuc-Agoa; into it empties another, called the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> or Olighin, which rises in central <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and flows southwest until it joins the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> approximately south of the west end of Lake Erie; however, this river is not a
                    distortion of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, for the sketch shows another tributary approximating the course of the Indiana stream.
                    On the basis of this map, which was drawn nearly fifteen years after the supposed discovery, it is
                    possible to speculate that LaSalle may have crossed Lake Erie in 1669 and reached the Allegheny or
                    some other river in northwestern <placeName>
                        <region reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>

                    </placeName>. Possibly his desire for glory led him to repeat a story of his supposed discovery,
                    using the details he had already learned from the Indians; or possibly later, in an attempt to
                    detract from the fame of Jolliet, some of LaSalle's friends proceeded to illuminate his
                    name by recording the rumors related <list type="footnotes">

                    the desertion of part of his men, LaSalle may have turned to the fur trade, for Nicholas Perrot
                    reported seeing him together with a hunting party of five or six Frenchmen and ten or twelve
                    Iroquois on the <geogName>Ottawa</geogName> River in the summer of 1670.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> This
                    hypothesis is re-enforced by documents, dated 1671 and 1672, which relate to LaSalle's
                    purchase of merchandise,<hi rend="sup">35</hi> a fact which seems to indicate that he was collecting
                    furs somewhere. But here again one must be cautious in reaching a conclusion. In the first place,
                    the Franquelin Map of 1684 labels a roughly sketched Maumee as the Agoussaké, while in
                    the fragment describing rivers and peoples LaSalle clearly implied that the Agoussaké
                    joined his so-called <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> before that stream fell into the Saint-Louis, or present-day <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. And this fragment was apparently written at about the same time the map was drawn.
                    Secondly, Perrot's testimony appears in a reminiscence written many years later, and Perrot
                    did at times confuse dates.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In surveying the documentary evidence so far uncovered, if one considers the difficulties raised, it
                    is hard to reach any other conclusion but that LaSalle had no first-hand knowledge of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. The descriptions of the region are highly inaccurate, the evidence of the various
                    documents certainly does not tally at all, and his own references betray ignorance, evident
                    misinformation, and downright untruths. Therefore it seems reasonable that the historian might well
                    question the authenticity of the supposed discovery until better, more exact, and more conclusive
                    evidence is produced.</p>

            <head>IS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION IN DANGER?</head>
            <p>Three proposals to change the character of the association have been made. By opposing a meeting in a
                    Southern city because of racial discrimination, certain members would make the society a reform
                    organization. Once race matters are arranged to their satisfaction, labor questions, or something
                    else might determine where the meetings would be held.</p>
            <p>A second proposal is to change the name of the society and a third calls for a change in the name of
                    the <hi rend="i">Review.</hi> Both have an illustrious history under their present names which are
                    descriptive of their origin and of the largest number of the members. The society has been in a
                    flourishing condition and is likely to remain so if it continues true to itself: an historical
                    society devoted to the history of the great <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName>.</p>
            <p>It is unfair to the founders and to the membership past and present of the <geogName>Mississippi
                        Valley</geogName> Historical Association to try to use its organization, its members, its
                    goodwill, and its finances to form a national society. To pursue this goal will likely result in
                    division, strife, possibly a law suit, and certainly injury to the association. There ought to be an
                    easier way to found a national society.</p>

            <p>Efforts to destroy the present society should be rejected. It should not become a reform
                    organization. Keep it a society that can meet in <placeName>

                    oblige you for a small fee, or of waiting for the passage of the official post rider who carried the

            <p>The motive for this expansion was not primarily to enable friends in far places to keep track of one
                    another or merchants to order goods from the East. President George Washington told Congress in 1791
                    that the "importance of the post-office and post-roads … is increased by their
                    instrumentality in diffusing a knowledge of the laws and proceedings of the Government, which while
                    it contributes to the security of the people, serves also to guard them against the effects of

            </p>
            <p>Postmaster General Timothy Pickering echoed a similar view in 1793, saying that as for "our
                    fellow citizens in the remote parts of the Union … without the aid of the public post
                    roads they will not only be embarrassed in their correspondence but remain destitute of every
                    necessary information."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rufus Putman, writing from Marietta in 1794, pointed out the political significance of mail service:
                    "the information by this means obtained as to the measures of the government on the one
                    hand, the State of the people on the other, the knowledge diffused among the people by Newspapers,
                    by corrispondence between frinds, and other communictions with these remote parts of the American
                    Empire may be of infinite consequence to the government. Northing can be more fatal to a republican

            <p>General W. Johnston remained postmaster for two years and then resigned, to be replaced in rapid
                    succession by Henry Hurst, William B. Coupland, and William Prince. By July 1, 1803, Johnston was
                    back in office and remained until 1812. He was succeeded by Prince again for a year, and then J. D.

            <p>The attractions of the job were not great. It was, as it still is, political recognition from the
                    national capital, although the partisan possibilities of the jobs had not been fully developed. The
                    salary was meager and on a commission basis, which meant that the postmaster had to have other
                    regular employment.</p>
            <p>According to the law of 1792, he was paid forty per cent of the gross receipts of his post office
                    until the commission amounted to fifty dollars. Then he received thirty per cent of the receipts up
                    to the sum of one hundred dollars, and beyond that only twenty per cent of the receipts. He was also
                    paid fifty per cent of the postage paid on newspapers. No postmaster could receive more than
                    eighteen hundred dollars, because the Postmaster General in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> was paid only two thousand dollars.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> These commissions were
                    reduced slightly in 1797, and no further change was made until 1810, when the ceiling on pay was
                    raised to two thousand dollars. The local postmasters also were allowed the franking privilege, or
                    free postage.</p>
            <p>In the first year of his holding the appointment, Postmaster Johnston received the munificent sum of
                    $32.63. The salary rose to $136.42 the second year.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
                    Moreover, he was not permitted to charge the government any rent for quarters. If a room or

                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>

            <p>Mail service improved very slowly. The service from <placeName>

                    </placeName> to <placeName>

                    </placeName> was made fortnightly in 1809, and the carrier was to be fined ten dollars for every
                    half hour he was late.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> The announced schedules were in a sense ideals, not
                    realities; they represented optimum service. Bad weather, accidents, Indian attack, illness,
                    drunkenness, and willful neglect easily upset the schedules. There were frequent complaints by the
                    populace and the postmasters.</p>
            <p>The contractors, those hardy men who actually carried the mail between towns and on whom the whole
                    service depended, were an independent lot. They worked directly for the Post Office Department in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and had small regard for the village postmasters whose salaries were so far below
                    theirs. The postmasters reciprocated this disdain and were ever ready to make complaints to the
                    Postmaster General over delayed mails. Much of the federal official's time was occupied in
                    warning and threatening irresponsible contractors, in seeking more information about derelictions of
                    duty, and in canceling contracts and awarding new ones. Since he could not know available local
                    inhabitants he had, perforce, to ask the local postmaster to find local bidders and recommend the
                    best one. So whatever the attitude of the contractor, he found himself under the necessity of
                    pleasing the postmasters along his route or of losing his job.</p>
            <p>Some of the complaints should be mentioned. The Postmaster General complained to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> had failed to arrive on January 16, 23, or 30, the regular days, but had shown up once
                    on the twenty-fifth. The contractor was accused of excessive drinking. The westbound rider out of <placeName>

                    he started out or returned. Finally the Postmaster General sent word to the ferryman that he would

            <p>It is not to be wondered at that the failures of individual riders prompted the government to prefer
                    sending the mail by stage coaches as soon as regular routes were established. However, even this was
                    not always a satisfactory solution, for a passenger paid a higher fare than a mail sack for the same
                    space inside the coach. Therefore when the coach grew crowded, the driver pitched out a mail bag
                    (usually the bulky one containing newspapers) in order to make room for another more lucrative
                        passenger.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes the postmasters themselves were responsible for delayed mails. Thus a postmaster might hold
                    up sending mail West until the carrier from the East had arrived, and vice versa. The Postmaster
                    General tried to impress on them that this practice could not be permitted. The mail must leave a
                    given office on schedule, regardless of whether the connecting mails had arrived, or the failure of
                    one carrier would delay the entire route or system of routes.</p>

                    both offices were consumed." However, that was incidental to the loss of his three children

                    that he had three hundred pounds of gunpowder stored in his house.</p>
            <p>The loudest complainers about irregularities and delays were the newspapers. They were dependent upon
                    receipt of letters and other newspapers for material with which to fill their own columns.
                    Consequently, the failure of the mails affected their livelihood directly. Even though they were
                    privileged users of the mails, they did not hesitate to curse <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The peculiar position of newspapers in the postal system requires a brief explanation. In colonial
                    days, when Benjamin Franklin was joint postmaster general of the colonies, newspapers were not
                    admitted to the mails. However, publishers frequently were appointed postmasters, and they arranged
                    with the post riders to carry their own paper as an extra parcel and to exclude that of their
                    rivals. In 1758 Franklin opened up the mails to all newspapers at low fixed rates.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> This consideration was adopted in the basic laws enacted in 1782 by the Confederation. But
                    in 1792, the free exchange of copies between newspaper publishers was granted.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
                    The idea of a free press and an informed electorate seems to have prompted this privilege to a
                    private business.</p>
            <p>Printers' exchanges soon became a burden on the Post Office Department, but every effort to
                    reduce the number of papers sent free for exchange brought cries of pain and anguish from every
                    editor. When it was once proposed to abolish the carriage of free exchanges, the <placeName>

                    course, the free receipt of other newspapers meant that any given editor had the services of several
                    hundred on-the-spot reporters free of charge. But because every Congressman was supported by some
                    newspapers, their views on the mail carried weight. What Congressman would deliberately offend his
                    party's editors or his own supporters?</p>
            <p>The Post Office Department's financial problem in regard to all newspapers, both free and
                    postpaid, was aggravated by the flimsy wrappings in which they were mailed. And because of their
                    bulk they were usually carried outside the stage coaches, exposed to the weather, or if inside,
                    passengers put their feet on them or opened them to read the news.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> In brief,
                    newspapers were much more bothersome to transport than letters, and the trouble was made less
                    palatable by the twin facts that some of them had to be carried free and that any failures in
                    handling brought forth complaints from persons provided with the longest ranged voices.</p>
            <p>Magazines and pamphlets were not admitted to the mails at all. Postmaster General Pickering had ruled
                    that they were subject to letter postage, and this charge excluded them. Their weight and bulk was
                    also recognized as a handicap to the speed of the mails. Only religious societies were granted
                    permission to circulate such publications. It was not until the end of the territorial period, 1816,
                    that by an act of Congress magazines and pamphlets were admitted to the mail and special postage
                    rates provided.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> By this same act, letter postage was reduced to six cents for
                    the first thirty miles, on up to twenty-five cents for distances over four hundred miles. No further
                    changes were made until 1836.</p>
            <p>Toward the end of the territorial period, in 1814, Indiana had sixteen post offices and six hundred
                    nine miles of post roads, in a territory of thirteen counties. The cost of transporting the mails
                    over the routes was $987.50, while the proceeds from the sale of postage amounted to
                        $542.63.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> At least four more post offices were established

                    </placeName> by campaigning on the issue of "white supremacy." This type of appeal
                    has not been limited to <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>. The race question has also played a part in other states with heavy colored
                    populations, but such campaigns are confined to the South today. However this has not always been
                    the case. In the middle of the nineteenth century the race question was a very live political issue
                    in Indiana.</p>
            <p>The census of 1860 showed Indiana as having a population of 11,428 Negroes as compared with a total
                    of 1,338,710 whites. In other words the Negroes constituted less than one per cent of the total.
                    Figures of successive censuses from 1800 to 1860 showed that the number of Negroes in Indiana
                    relative to the white population had steadily declined.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Nevertheless the race
                    issue had a conspicuous place in Indiana politics until after the Civil War.</p>
            <p>It is well known that there had been an influential pro-slavery group in Indiana Territory and that
                    the territorial legislature had passed an indenture law which amounted to a thinly disguised
                        slavery.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> With the achievement of statehood the party opposed to slavery was
                    in the ascendancy, but the state legislature continued to manifest a strong bias against the free
                    Negroes already in the state and took measures to prevent an increase in their numbers. Not only
                    were Negroes and Mulattoes denied the vote and the privilege of serving in the militia, they were
                    also prevented by law from testifying in court in a case in which a white man was a party.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                    Successive laws were passed which provided severe penalties for persons entering into such unions
                    and for persons aiding or abetting them. For example, the act of 1840, which was entitled
                    "An Act to Prohibit the Amalgamation of Whites and Blacks," provided fines of from
                    one to five thousand dollars and confinement in the state prison for terms of from ten to twenty
                    years for persons marrying in violation of this act. A minister performing such a marriage was

            </p>
            <p>A question which appeared to alarm the lawmakers even more that the status of the colored population
                    already in the state was the possibility of an influx of free Negroes and fugitive slaves from the
                    South. In 1831 the Indiana General Assembly followed the example of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and passed a law which required any black or mulatto person coming into the state to
                    post bond as a guarantee of good behavior and as security against becoming a public charge.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> The convention which drew up the second state constitution sought to put an
                    even more effective guarantee of white supremacy into the document. The notorious Article Thirteen
                    provided that no Negro or Mulatto should come into the state after the adoption of the constitution
                    and provided that fines collected for violation of the article should be appropriated to pay for the
                    colonization of such Negroes. This article was submitted to the voters separately and was ratified
                    by even larger majorities than the main body of the constitution.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not surprising that a state which had enacted such measures should show little enthusiasm for
                    the antislavery movement, nor that the Liberty and Free Soil parties encountered much hostility
                    within its borders. In no other part of the country was feeling in favor of the finality of the
                    Compromise of 1850 more marked, and the Republican party got off to a slow start. The coalition
                    which developed in Indiana in the fifties in opposition to the dominant Democratic party was held
                    together by other forces, such as temperance and Know-Nothingism, as much as by opposition to the

                    adopted in Indiana as early as in other states.</p>
            <p>The rise of the Republican party in the field of national politics and the coming of the Civil War
                    gave new emphasis to the race question. It is true that little that was new was added to the
                    arguments. Most of them were already threadbare and few of them were rational. Appeals to race
                    prejudice were the stock in trade of many a politician. Even some of the most distinguished, such as
                    Stephen A. Douglas, had shown a willingness in the past to resort to such tactics. But the appeals
                    took on a new intensity because for the first time there appeared to be a real possibility of a
                    drastic change in the status of the Negro population in the South. Democrats made much of the
                    possible threat to white supremacy in the campaign of 1860.</p>
            <p>In order to elect a president in 1860 it was necessary for the Republicans to carry Indiana and <placeName>

                    voters must be convinced that the party was not as "radical" as its opponents
                    alleged. It was imperative to refute the charges of "abolitionism" and to nominate
                    a candidate who would be reassuring to the cautious. Even Horace Greeley's <placeName>

                    party. It has never proposed to use the power of the Federal Government to abolish
                    slavery… . It does not contemplate any national scheme of emancipation of the African
                        race."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Indiana Republicans were active in promoting the nomination
                    of Abraham Lincoln, who was considered a safer candidate, one less tainted with
                    "ultra-ism" than the better known William H. Seward.</p>
            <p>Democrats regarded the efforts of their opponents to represent their party and candidate as
                    "conservative" as sheer hypocrisy and charged Lincoln with being an advocate of
                    Negro equality. Stephen A. Douglas declared: "The rights of the negro; the equality of the
                    negro with the white man, universal suffrage, extending to negroes as well as to white men, is the
                    grand central theme of the Republican organization." Lesser Democrats followed his lead and
                    enlarged upon the theme. They warned that Republican policies would lead to an influx of Negroes
                    into Indiana from the South and that <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>Republicans sought to answer these charges by reiterating that they had no intention of interfering
                    with slavery in states where it was already established. In fact, rather than leading to an increase
                    in the number of Negroes in the North, their policies would prevent an increase. For was not a basic
                    principle of the party the exclusion of slaves (i.e. Negroes) from the territories? They scoffed at
                    the suggestion that they favored racial amalgamation and pointed out with considerable glee that the
                    only part of the country in which miscegenation was practiced on a wide scale was in the slave
                    states where presumably most masters were members of the Democratic party.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, it was abundantly clear that many Republicans had little or no humanitarian interest in the
                    welfare of the Negro. They were almost frantic in their efforts to disclaim any intention of
                    elevating his condition. The following excerpt from a letter to the <placeName>

                    resolute leadership of Governor Oliver P. Morton in support of a policy of preserving the Union by
                    force, if necessary.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Indiana Democrats were loudly demanding compromise and
                    were opposed to the use of coercion. With the outbreak of a shooting war most members of the party
                    came loyally to the support of the military effort, but they continued to insist that the war could
                    have been avoided by the adoption of the Crittenden Compromise and they never ceased to charge the
                    Republican party with responsibility for the country's woes.</p>
            <p>As the nation plunged deeper and deeper into the conflict, the question inevitably
                    arose—what was the relationship of slavery to the war which was being waged to preserve
                    the Union? This was, of course, one of the most important and complex questions facing the Lincoln
                    administration. It was to become a major political issue in Indiana and one which gave rise to great
                    bitterness.</p>
            <p>From the beginning radical Republicans branded slavery with being the cause of the war and saw in the
                    war an opportunity to destroy the hated institution. The <hi rend="i">Indiana True Republican</hi>
                    (mouthpiece of George W. Julian) declared: "There can be no <hi rend="i">final

            <p>The Democrats continued to blame the war on the abolitionist element in the Republican party, and

                    extermination of slavery, it was asserted, and "the best blood of the North will never be

                    1862. Most Indiana Democrats refused to accept the invitation of the Republicans to join with them
                    in forming a Union party. They stuck to their own organization and hoped to regain control in the
                    fall elections by stressing the dangers of emancipation and the related question of the status of
                    the free Negro.</p>

                    </placeName> Senator, declared in the opening address: "With the negro slave and his
                    condition, we have nothing to do, nothing whatever, either as a purpose, incident or consequence of
                    the war." Resolutions adopted at the convention condemned the "twin heresies,
                    Northern sectionalism and Southern secession," and pledged the party to support a war for
                    preserving the Constitution and the Union, but warned: "We are opposed to a war for the
                    emancipation of the Negroes," and branded proposals "to liberate and arm the negro
                    slaves" as "unconstitutional, insulting to loyal citizens, a disgrace to the
                        age."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>There is considerable evidence that the party leaders had rightly gauged the reactions of the voters
                    of Indiana. If the actions of county conventions are in any way reliable criteria of the opinions of
                    the voters at the "grass roots" level, the mass of Democrats were genuinely
                    alarmed over emancipation and its possible consequences. Democratic county conventions held in the
                    closing weeks of 1861, before the state convention, had been almost unanimous in warning against
                    turning the war into an abolitionist crusade and in condemning proposals to use Negro troops. The

            <p>In spite of the warnings of the Democrats, the exigencies of the military situation plus the
                    increasing efforts of the more radical Republicans were converting the President and many moderates
                    to measures which would mean the weakening of slavery.</p>
            <p>Very early in the war Union men realized that the South possessed a military advantage in the labor
                    of its slaves and had begun to urge steps to deprive the enemy of this advantage. The <placeName>

                    allowed to take part in the war and be regarded as too sacred for capture, confiscation, or removal?
                    … As property when captured, they should be used for the benefit of the government, to

            </p>
            <p>As the war progressed this line of reasoning came to be generally accepted among Republicans and by
                    many Democrats as well. Indiana's Republican representatives in Congress supported the
                    Confiscation Act which Congress finally adopted in July, 1862. Senator Joseph Wright, a
                    "War Democrat" appointed by Governor Morton to fill the unexpired term of Jesse
                    Bright, also supported the Confiscation Act in its final form. However, Wright did not go along with
                    the more radical Republicans in other measures which were under consideration by Congress. For
                    example, he opposed immediate emancipation of the slaves in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="dcu">District of Columbia</country>
                    </placeName>. He also voted against the measure abolishing slavery in the territories although his
                    colleague, Henry S. Lane, and the Republican delegation in the House voted for it.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

            <p>Meanwhile, Indiana Democrats were viewing with alarm and condemning every sign that the
                    Administration or Congress might be veering in the direction of an emancipation program.
                    Representative Daniel Voorhees, loudest critic of the Republicans among Indiana Democrats, devoted
                    his maiden speech in the House to a denunciation of any and all schemes of emancipation. Any such
                    proposal, he declared, was a betrayal of promises made by the Republicans at the beginning of the
                    war. The soldiers from Indiana were fighting to preserve <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The Democrats were also alarmed over signs that the Republicans in Congress were seeking to bring
                    about the much dreaded "negro equality." For example, bills were introduced to
                    repeal the laws which prohibited Negroes from testifying in the courts of the <placeName>

                    enforce the exclusion law, or, indeed, that it was capable of being enforced. Nevertheless,
                    Democrats continued to pose as upholders of the exclusion measures and to excoriate the Republican
                    administration for failure to enforce them. In consequence of this laxity, they warned, the state
                    was in danger of being overrun by Negroes. As the election of 1862 drew nearer items concerning the
                    influx of Negroes appeared frequently in the Democratic press, and in the campaign great stress was

            <p>Of course there were other issues in the campaign. The Democrats also leveled their attacks on the

            <p>On the whole Republican-Union party supporters ignored emancipation and the race question as much as
                    possible. They were fighting frantically to stay in power, for the local elections in the spring had
                    shown that the tide was running in favor of the Democrats. The Democrats attributed this to the
                    abolitionist leanings of the Republicans. In their desperation Republicans concentrated their
                    efforts on "exposing" the alleged "disloyalty" of the Democrats.
                    They denounced secret societies and talked much of the Indiana "traitors" who
                    belonged to them. They charged Hendricks and Voorhees with plotting the formation of a Northwest
                    confederacy and accused the <placeName>

            <p>In the meantime, more and more pressure was being brought upon the Lincoln administration to proclaim
                    a policy of general emancipation. For example, in July, Robert Dale Owen, a life-long Democrat and
                    formerly an advocate of compromise if necessary to save the Union, addressed a letter to the
                    Secretary of War in which he announced his conversion to the necessity of emancipation as the only
                    means of ending the war and insuring a lasting peace.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Owen's plea, even though he advocated compensation for loyal slaveholders, was as yet too
                    advanced for Indiana's leading Republican newspaper. While admitting that more and more
                    people were coming to share Owen's views, the <placeName>

                    the October elections in Indiana. The Indiana radicals were pleased. Their only regret was that the

                    interpreted the result as a "voice against the frauds, the corruption and imbecility of the
                    party in power—against the emancipation schemes and proclamations of the
                    Administration—against taxing the people to buy negroes, and a rebuke to the Republican
                    Party for repudiating the Crit-tenden Compromise … which would have prevented civil
                    war." A few days later it was asserted that the Republicans lost because the soldiers of
                    Indiana did not want to compete with Negro labor when they came home. The <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi>
                    counseled: "The defeated politicians of Indiana must abandon this emancipation policy which
                    strikes at the honor and remuneration of labor, before they can repair their fortunes by an appeal

                    the fact that soldiers could not vote. It was asserted that the absence of seventy thousand voters

            <p>Following the Emancipation Proclamation and the Republican defeats there was a marked change in the

            <p>The Democrats injected the question of the use of Negro troops into the campaign of 1864. An address

                    added: "It ought to be manifest to every reasonable man that negroes in service should be
                    paid less than white troops… . The market value of their labor is known to be less than
                    that of citizens, and it is equally clear that their services are much less valuable in the
                    army." The Republicans insisted on equal pay and pointed out with relish that individual
                    Democrats were eager to avail themselves of colored men as substitutes in order to escape military

            <p>Lincoln had promised that Negroes who enlisted would be treated as prisoners of war if they were

            <p>Opposition to the Lincoln administration reached its height in the fall elections of 1862 and the
                    first part of 1863. Thereafter the inexorable, though slow, force of Union victories gradually
                    strengthened the party in power and carried it to victory in 1864. But the critics were not
                    silenced. In fact many of them became more shrill. They realized that the end of the war would mean
                    more than the mere suppression of rebellion. The Union which would be restored would be a different
                    Union from the one of 1860, but they were powerless to halt the changes. In their desperation and
                    frustration they made wilder and wilder charges. In Indiana, moreover, the position of the Democrats
                    was made more difficult by the fact that they were accused of disloyalty. Certain members of the
                    party were, in fact, brought to trial before military tribunals in the fall of 1864 and convicted of
                    treason. It is not within the scope of this article to assess the Copperhead menace in Indiana nor
                    to determine the guilt or innocence of those charged with disloyalty. It is sufficient here to note
                    that the charges of Copperheadism and the treason trials furnished political capital for the
                    Republican Union party.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> The Democrats sought to draw attention from these
                    embarrassments by charges against the administration which sometimes bordered on the hysterical. The
                    same appeals to race prejudice which had been used in 1860 and 1862 were revived in 1864.</p>
            <p>There was much talk of the menace of "Negro equality" and especially of
                    "amalgamation." It was reported that young women at Democratic rallies carried
                    banners with inscriptions beseeching: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>The Democratic papers carried stories of elopements of white daughters with Negro servants and of
                    favors shown by white women to Negro soldiers. It was charged that all radical Republicans were

            <p>Democratic county and district conventions adopted resolutions condemning emancipation and accusing
                    the President of deliberately prolonging the war in order to free the black race. There were also
                    the usual attempts to play upon the white laborer's fear of competition with the Negro. The
                    Democratic state platform called for a more stringent Negro exclusion law, and during the campaign
                    Governor Morton was accused of subverting the state constitution and laws by conniving at the
                    illegal entry of Negroes into the state.<hi rend="sup">60</hi>

            <p>While the Republican Union party men insisted that the Democrats were using the race issue to detract
                    attention from other questions they also felt compelled to expend considerable campaign oratory and
                    editorial writing in refuting their opponents' charges. They sought especially to show that
                    the Republican party was the friend of the white working man. Ex-Governor and ex-Senator Joseph
                    Wright in a speech in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> admitted that "the appeals to the prejudices and fears of the working classes
                    in the North in regard to the results of the emancipation of the slaves in the South," had
                    done more, in his opinion, "to divide the sentiment of our people and weaken them in their
                    support of the Government than almost any other one thing." He hastened to assure the
                    workingmen that their fears were groundless. There was no danger of a great migration of Negroes
                    since their labor would be needed in the South. Moreover, as the condition of the Negro population
                    improved under a system of wage labor, there would be a better market for goods produced by white
                        workers.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>

            <p>However, the hopes of the Democracy were dimmed by two developments in the closing weeks of the
                    campaign. The first of these was a marked improvement in the military situation, particularly as the
                    result of the fall of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Sherman and Sheridan's victories in the Shenandoah. The second was the
                    trial and conviction of certain Democrats before military tribunals. The trials coincided nicely
                    with the height of the political campaign and were used by the Republicans to advantage. The result
                    was a sweeping victory for the Union ticket at both the state and federal levels.</p>
            <p>The end of the long war was in sight. The military victory of the Union armies and the political
                    victory of the Republicans meant the end of slavery and a new era in the realm of race relations.
                    Democrats recognized that slavery was doomed and that their efforts to resist the new order were in

                    they also recognized that the question of the status of the free Negro remained to be settled. Most

               <hi rend="i">Indiana at War: Civilian Directory</hi>, Volume IV in the series <hi rend="i">Indiana in
                        World War II</hi>, will be published by the Indiana War History Commission in June. Volume II in
                    the series, <hi rend="i">Letters from Fighting Hoosiers</hi>, and the Gold Star Honor Rolls for
                    several Indiana counties, all parts of Volume I, have already been published. Volume III,
                    "The Hoosier Training Ground," a history of Army and Navy training centers and
                    military installations within the state during the war years, is now being prepared.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Indiana at War</hi> is a book of 1330 pages which makes an effort to describe every
                    civilian governmental agency and volunteer organization which contributed in any way to the war
                    effort within the state and to list by name, position, and dates of service as many of the civilians
                    who participated in this effort as the preserved records permit. More than 30,000 Hoosiers and some
                    300 of the organizations in which they served are listed. The bulk of the book is devoted to the
                    civilian defense organizations, the price control and rationing boards, the selective service
                    system, and the war bond sales organization, each of which is carried to the level of the local
                    community with complete rosters of civilian personnel. The book also treats, as fully as possible,
                    all federal, state, and local governmental agencies and officials who were involved in the war
                    effort, volunteer service agencies such as USO and Red Cross, educational institutions which trained
                    military personnel and war workers, and the wartime contributions of patriotic societies, youth
                    organizations, professional associations, business groups, labor unions, agricultural interests, and
                    religious, social, and civic organizations. For sixty-six of these agencies and groups, the
                    organizational analysis and personnel listing is carried to the city or county level. The book
                    therefore not only pictures the war effort of the state as a whole, but contains the material for a
                    fairly complete survey of the wartime activities of every Hoosier community.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Directory</hi> is divided into twelve parts, with an introduction by Governor
                    Schricker, nineteen maps and charts, and three indices. A dozen people were engaged at one time or
                    another during a period of six years in the gigantic task of collecting, classifying, and compiling
                    data, and assembling, <pb n="190" id="VAA4025-047-2-066"/> writing, and checking the final copy. The
                    search for material extended into every county of Indiana and as far abroad as

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In spite of the bulk of the book, less than half the collected information was
                    included within its pages. The remainder is retained in the files of the War History Commission.</p>
            <p>Although historians and genealogists have been interested since the beginning of American history in
                    preserving careful records of individual participation in the armed forces during time of war, this
                    is the first volume which has made an effort to render a similar service for civilian participation.
                    The book would therefore be valuable for its unique character alone. It has other virtues, however.
                    Although the narrative portions of the book are necessarily limited in scope, they provide the
                    essential facts in the history of the origin, development, and wartime contributions of each of the
                    agencies and organizations listed. Taken together, these brief descriptions provide an over-all
                    blueprint for the pattern of civilian wartime mobilization which could be drawn in no other way. It
                    is not suggested that this blueprint could be applied without modification to any future crisis, but
                    it is certainly evident that it will serve as a valuable reference source for civilian defense
                    workers and state planners henceforward. The size of the book is in itself an impressive reminder of
                    the innumerable and complex links by which a civilian population is connected with a total war.</p>
            <p>So important is this work regarded by the state government that the bulk of the first printing is to
                    be distributed to libraries, governmental offices, and civilian defense councils. A limited number
                    of copies will be available for purchase from the <placeName>

            <p>David Mitchell Hudson, a sergeant in Company K of the 120th Indiana Volunteers,<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    was born in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, January 15, 1837. In 1856 he enrolled in the preparatory school of North
                    Western Christian University.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> For his more advanced training, however, he chose
                    Moores Hill College.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Upon the completion of his formal education, he taught
                    school. Apparently the vocation of his choice did not occupy all of his time, and he became a tiller
                    of the soil as well as a worker in his father's tanyard. Moreover, this busy schedule
                    probably did not interfere with his social life, for on February 20, 1862, he married Sarah Margaret
                        Hamacher.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> To this union two children were born. Willey Victor, the first
                    son, was born on December 7, 1862. The second son, David Edwin, arrived on July 9, 1864, six months
                    after the father had entered the service of his country.</p>

                    the collection bore the date of February 3. The messages from David to Sarah covered the period from
                    February 3 to August 26, 1864. Much of the material has been deleted because of its personal nature.</p>

                                    Well I cannot tell you. It is generally admitted now, that we will go to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> or somewhere thereabouts to do Garrison duty, and that we will go in
                                    less than a week though we are not sure of this. Still there is some talk that we
                                    will leave next Saturday or Sunday….</p>
                        <p>I will give you a list of our officers.</p>

                        <p>Jimmy is now acting as Company clerk,—an easy place. Cap Tobias offered me
                                    4 dollars a month extra if I would take that place, but I did not like to give up
                                    the place I had. For you see Sarah I have an easy time and 2 promotions will go to a
                                    Lieutenancy. And then I would rather not always be pinned to the officers.</p>

                                    yesterday at the same time—24 hours on the road. We are now with our
                                    whole brigade—the 120, 124, 128 &amp; 130 Ind Vols. The 22"
                                    is here.</p>
                        <p>I was sadly disappointed in the land in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                                    </placeName> so far as we saw it is very poor. But in this state it is a great deal
                                    better. There are no towns at all worth notice on the whole route except Bowling <placeName>
                                        <region type="state">Green Ky.</region>
                                    </placeName> and Franklin Tenn—we passed through Bowling Green at 8
                                    O'clock yesterday morning.</p>
                        <p>I rode 85 miles on top of the Cars, and I dont think I saw 85 acres of wheat on the
                                    whole rout. Here in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                                    </placeName> the fences are nearly all destroyed. Gardening is going
                                    on—and peach trees are now in full bloom. I was on top of the cars when
                                    the train went through 2 tunnels a half mile through. And I tell you it looks
                                    dangerous to set on top of a train, and see it bulging headlong in to a little hole
                                    in the ground—that looks more like the mouth of a cave than any thing
                                    else. The train run 60 feet under ground.</p>
                        <p>When we got to camp it was pouring down rain like fury, and we had to go to bed wet
                                    on the wet ground. Though we had plenty <pb n="194" id="VAA4025-047-2-070"/> of
                                    blankets and slept very well at last—as we slept none the night before on

                                    and several hundred loopholes for rifles. From it you can see Soldiers tents all

                                    and last night. Something very uncommon away down here in Dixie. And our wood is
                                    scarce too—but we will take care of ourselves. We tore down a small brick
                                    house yesterday to get the joists for wood—but they have hauled some
                                    since.</p>

                                    orders is given—How the hill side is covered with our tents, but in an
                                    hour after the orders are rec'd the tents are all gone, and there is
                                    nothing left to show where we have been but some old dirty clothes and our temporary
                                    cooking furnaces.</p>
                        <p>The tents, our beds, bed furniture, and all our personal property is on our backs and
                                    we are off South. There is to be but 2 wagons with our regiment (and one ambulance).
                                    We must carry every thing but our cooking utensils. I tell you it makes a good
                                    load….</p>
                        <p>But the hard marching is what I dont like—But our general told us he would
                                    be easy on us. He said, he would not make us march more than 8 or 10 miles a day at
                                    first until we got used to it….</p>
                        <p>I was down in town yesterday and saw the turn bridge over the <geogName>Cumberland
                                        river</geogName>—It is 500 feet across and turns out of the way to
                                    let boats pass up or down and then it is turned back to let the trains run across
                                    the river. It is the greatest structure I ever saw.</p>

                        <p>We got here to Murfresboro yesterday 3 P.M. I have seen the famous battle ground
                                    where the tops of the trees were cut off with cannon balls. Yesterday morning we
                                    left Luverne or rather where Luverne use[d] to be—but there is no sign of
                                    a town there now but old chimneys.</p>
                        <p>We have passed through a country covered with rocks where Cedars are more plenty than
                                    beach trees are in Indiana. We marched all the way from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to this place. And are going from here to KN oxville <placeName>

                        </p>
                        <p>… Marching 15 miles a day with a Soldier's load is not pleasant
                                    work. Pick up our tents in the morning with all our bed cloths our Knapsacks and
                                    rations enough to last for 4 days, and then march all day in the sun and then all on
                                    a pike at that it is not funny. But I am in for it, and will have to stand it the
                                    best I can. A great many of our regiment give out to day….</p>
                        <p>I never thought of seeing such fortifications as there is here at this place, rifle
                                    pits all around the town, and embankments, 10 to 15 feet high—it would be
                                    impossible for any force to take it.</p>

                                    We are here with the 27" I had a long talk with Volna yesterday evening. I
                                    went to the camp of the 27" and they told me Vol was out on picket and I
                                    followed the rail road out and found him, and then brought him to town and to our
                                    camp for the night. And such a town, it would take about 4 or 6 like it to make one
                                    like your native Crothersville. Volna and I bought 6 apples a little bigger than
                                    marbles for 25 cts. I cant write you much of a letter this time—as the
                                    27" boys are so thick they wont give me time. [In margin] Hoveys Division.</p>

                        <p>We are in camp at the foot of Lookout Mountain—the place where the famous
                                    battle was fought last November. We got here about 3 o'clock P. M. and
                                    after resting an hour I started to climb to the top of the Mountain a distance of
                                    about 2 miles—and so steep a part of the way that we had to climb ladders
                                    to get to the top, but after just one hour I reached the top where the rebels once
                                    made a stand.</p>
                        <p>From the top of the Mountain they say we can see 6 States, but the whole view is one
                                    range of mountains after another as far as the eye can see. So that the more I see
                                    of the South the less I like it, and the more I think of old Indiana, my native
                                    state.</p>

                                    </placeName> we have marched 45 miles through the prettiest country I have seen
                                    since I left Hoosier-dom. I like the country fine. We have stopped here for awhile
                                    and they say we will be scattered along the rail road here on Guard duty. I hope so.
                                    If we are thus scattered along the road we will have a tolerable easy time and may
                                    be get to stay here all Summer. I know <hi rend="i">you</hi> would like <hi rend="i">that.</hi>

                        <p>There is a division of old Soldiers here and we will take their place and they will
                                    go to the front. We have been marching for 75 miles within 5 to 20 miles of the
                                    rebel lines but still there is not much danger because there is a large Union force
                                    between us and the rebel army. Rebels continue to come in along the lines and give
                                    themselves up. The other day a whole company came in down below here Captain
                                    Lieutenants and all. They say the rebel Soldiers are badly discouraged….</p>
                        <p>The people through here are all Union and the country is a very healthy looking
                                    place—tolerable hilly with plenty of pure water. The wheat here looks
                                    well. And there will be plenty of peaches and apples. How I would like to stay here
                                    till fruit time—the old soldiers say we couldnt wish to stay in abetter
                                    place than this for the people are sensible sociable and Union, and the country is
                                    pleasant and healthy….</p>
                        <p>We have marched every day for 20 days. We left <placeName>

                        <p>Marching was tolerable hard work for us, especially at first and a great many of the
                                    men give out and had to be shipped but our company nearly all made the trip a foot,
                                    and now they are glad they did for they got to see so much of the country by
                                    marching through. We marched some every day for 20 days. Some days 8 or 9 miles and
                                    some days 15 or 16 miles….</p>
                        <p>We heard heavy canonading day before yesterday and yesterday the report came here
                                    that our men had taken <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, 39 miles from here. Rebel deserters here say if that is true the
                                    rebellion is played out here in the South West. That the Soldiers in <placeName>
                                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                                    </placeName> are so discouraged that they want to give the thing up and return to
                                    the Union. We have 12 rebel deserters here under guard now till we can send them
                                    down to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. I guess they will be sent off tomorrow. They say if Dalton is taken
                                    and Grant whips the rebs in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>

                        <p>They said that when they left they knew 1500 rebs that wanted to desert but they were
                                    afraid to, for if they try it and get caught they are sure to be shot. Still better.
                                    It is reported now that Dalton is taken and 7000 prisoners but you will know all
                                    about that before this reaches you. I can only hope it is true and that the war will
                                    soon be over.</p>

                                    </placeName> that we have marched through. It is such that I am not at all surprised
                                    at the specimens of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tenn.</region>
                                    </placeName> refugees that you see passing north on the rail road. And <pb n="198" id="VAA4025-047-2-074"/> here even in the Valley of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">East Tenn.</region>
                                    </placeName> the people are almost starved, and most of them Destitute of decent
                                    Clothing:. The refugees that come in here say that us Yankee soldiers (as they call
                                    us) know nothing at all about hardships; That the women and children through this
                                    country and <placeName>
                                        <country>Northern Georgia</country>
                                    </placeName> are bound to leave or starve. I pity the poor fellows. Still I believe
                                    that the Government is committing a great blunder in giving them the liberties they
                                    do.</p>
                        <p>The other day about 30 refugees came in here &amp; were allowed to run at will.
                                    They took quarters for the night in an old church and during the night 6 of them
                                    undertook to run the picket lines and go back to rebeldom. So you see they dont know
                                    who to trust. I'd hold them all. I'd put them at work on Public
                                    works and issue them their rations and thus they could do some good &amp; prove
                                    their loyalty at the same time. I tell you it wont do to trust the dogs at all, and
                                    in fact I doubt the loyalty of all of them if they thought their cause would be
                                    victorious.</p>
                        <p>There are a few Union men through this neighborhood, but the most of them are
                                    neutral, and a great many of them draw their provisions from the Government,
                                    Especially poor women who have no husbands or whose husbands are in the rebel army,
                                    and they too are avowed rebs.</p>

                        <p>We have been assigned to the 23rd army corps under General Schofield. He is now
                                    shipping his whole corps to this place, and I believe they are now about all here
                                    now. They say we (this corps) has to protect Gen Thomas's left flank which
                                    is East of Ringold and there about.</p>

                        <p>Gen Schofield has nearly all of his Corps here. There is some talk that we will leave
                                    this place in a few days but we know nothing about it, nor we dont know where we
                                    will go if we do leave.</p>
                        <p>I think from the General movements and the news from home that the Government is
                                    going to put the war over this spring and summer if it is possible that it can be
                                    done….</p>
                        <p>You have no idea… what it is to be among so many troops. There is now
                                    about 10000 or 12000 at this place. It is military and nothing else. There is as
                                    much rattle and noise as there is in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                                    </placeName>—but there is hardly a citizen to be seen, that is a
                                    man—there are plenty of women. Generally 5 or 6 in a

                        <p>After laying in the Sun half the day waiting orders we at last rec'd them
                                    and started of[f] in the line of the rail road for Dalton. We marched 7 miles and

                        <p>Our troops took Tunnel Hill the other day and are now getting along fine. But the

                                    </placeName>…. They say the regt is about 40 miles the other side of
                                    Dalton with the army and the rebs running all the time…. The report now
                                    is… that the armies are fighting hard down in front.</p>
                        <p>I am laying here in camp where the Christian Commission furnishes us all the
                                    religious newspapers and Testaments we want. They also furnish us paper, pens
                                    &amp; ink to write home and pay the postage on our letters if we wish them to do
                                    so. I have just been over and got a paper and a Testament. They also furnish us some
                                    potatoes, Crout &amp;c but the officers get the most of the eatables and those
                                    that are very sick. Us convalascents dont get many good things. We have Bread, meat,
                                    beans and Coffee. Sometimes rice….</p>
                        <p>I am getting tired of staying back here, but I am afraid that I would not be stout
                                    enough to march and carry a knapsack. It may be that I am missing some fun or
                                    fighting by staying here at <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. But war is all luck at best. So whether I am in luck or not it is all
                                    the same. It may be that I will get to do fighting before the war is over. They are
                                    all the time bringing wounded men in from the front and such as are able are sent on
                                    to <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. Though the numbers brought in are not great considering the size of
                                    the Army. Oh! may the war close. Pray all for the close of the war.</p>

                        <p>I am getting now perfectly stout and hearty. Still I am in the convalescent camp
                                    expecting every day or two to go to the regt. I have not heard much from the regt
                                    since I left it only that they are after the rebs beyond Dalton. They say fighting
                                    is still going on in front, and the rebs are retreating towards
                                            <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>, <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                           </placeName>. Also it is said that 2 Corps of our men are
                                    between the rebs and <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to keep them out of that place. If that is so, the rebs are surely in a
                                    desperate fix.</p>
                        <p>We have the news here that the 27" was in a hard fight and got badly cut up
                                    but we have not heard any names. I hope it is not as bad as represented. They say
                                    that they just cut and slashed the rebs all to pieces, just run mad and had no fears
                                    at all….</p>
                        <p>Well, well I wonder what you will do up north for men. I see now since the 100 days
                                    men are furnished the Government is thin[k]-ing of calling for 300,000 more
                                    volunteers. I guess they are going to try to frighten the rebs out and make them lay
                                    down their arms without fighting.</p>

                        <p>I got a letter from Jimmy yesterday, he is with the regt and in good health. He said
                                    in his letter that the 120 had been in a small fight and that 5 in the regt were
                                    wounded. They had to charge the rebs across an open field. He said they stood it
                                    fine….</p>
                        <p>We have the report here that our army corps (the 23") has been ordered to <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                                    </placeName>. If that is so, I may not see the regt for some time, for it would be
                                    impossible to overtake it after it leaves the rail road. Jimmy said in his letter
                                    that they were 90 miles from here and still kept going. But the rebs have crossed a
                                    river and burned the bridge which would stop them a day or two. They drew 10 days
                                    rations….</p>
                        <p>A few words about Soldiers aid societys &amp;c. I am here where I can see the
                                    workings of these things very well. And I see that the things which the people at
                                    home contribute for the poor sick and wounded soldiers are about half or more eaten
                                    by by the nasty cooks and lazy Doctors and nurses, while the soldiers for whom they
                                    were intended suffer. So I would say to all if you want to help the poor sick
                                    soldiers, send it to them your self by express, and dont allow any body else to
                                    handle it.</p>
                        <p>The other day I saw a soldier who was shot through the breast and in a bad fix
                                    cursing because he could not get half enough to eat, and at the same time the cooks
                                    were feasting on Butter, Onions, Potatoes, and such things sent from home for sick
                                    soldiers.</p>

                                    after the fighting is done they may keep a body some time on Garrison duty. I tell
                                    you I have a low opinion of the Rebs. They will kill till they are all killed off
                                    unless the Government adop[t]s very strict rules of punishment. I think when the war
                                    is over there will be some forces kept as post Guards but who they will keep I of
                                    course cant say. One thing is certain I shant get mad if they send me home as soon
                                    as the thing is done or sooner if they wish….</p>

                        <p>This evening I have wandered around to the Christian Commission where we can write on
                                    a good table…. As this is Sunday we thought we must have something extra
                                    for dinner to day, so we got us a nice mess of Greens and boiled it with our
                                    Sow-belly and fried our hard tack in water and grease which with good coffee almost
                                    made me think I was at home again….</p>
                        <pb n="202" id="VAA4025-047-2-078"/>
                        <p>The bridge here at the foot of Lookout Mountain broke down the other day so that we
                                    have had no mail for a few days, though it will be fixed tomorrow….</p>
                        <p>We have been having some very bad weather on soldiers for 3 or 4 days past. It has
                                    rained almost constantly since the morning of the 2" inst till to day, and
                                    part of the time so hard that it almost washed our tents away. But I think now the
                                    rain is about over. It is the best growing weather I ever saw. I would like to see
                                    the corn in Indiana. How does young crops look? Yes, and then there is a great many
                                    things in Indiana I would like to see besides young crops, but I must wait my
                                    time….</p>
                        <p>I am getting as fat as a dog, and twice as lousy. But I kill <hi rend="i">em.</hi>
                                    Every thing here is full of lice, go into an old camp and you can almost hear them
                                    crack under your feet as you walk along, but then it gives us good exercise to kill
                                    them and keeps us from getting so lazy…. The woods down about Dalton
                                    where the rebs left was alive with them.</p>

                        <p>We have no news much from the front, but still the news such as we can get is all
                                    good, especially from Grant. You know Sherman is very still &amp; dont allow
                                    much said. The rebs captured a train below here the other day, and we looked some
                                    for them here, but I guess they thought hardly safe "so they let us
                                    alone." And we didn't get to use the canon we run up into the
                                    forts where none had been placed before. They are still fortifying this place, and
                                    will make it a strong military post after the war is over.</p>

                        <p>From what the old soldiers tell me… I am troubled by the scurvy. My teeth
                                    and Gums are sore and my legs hurt me and ache, if I exercise too much. But still it
                                    is a disease that can be cured easy enough if I could get the right kind of medicine
                                    or it will leave when cold weather comes.</p>

                                    hear them fire a few Cannon here but I don't like the sound of Cannon. I
                                    heard them out at <placeName>

                        <p>I never want to hear a drum or see a cannon after the war is over. I want them to put
                                    the Cannon away and burst the head of <pb n="203" id="VAA4025-047-2-079"/> every
                                    Drum in in the U.S. Or if they have them at celebrations they wont get me in the
                                    procession. I dont like to march to the music of Drum and fife as well as I did a
                                    few years ago. I expect after I get home if I was to hear a drum I would imagine I
                                    heard somebody saying fall in! fall in!! and then you'd see me bounce out
                                    of bed in my shirt tail and begin to look about for my knapsack and gun expecting
                                    sure to be attacked immediately. But then instead of looking for my gun I might jump
                                    up and break out at the back door under the supposition that a hasty retreat was
                                    necessary.</p>

                        <p>Our Major is here in Town. He says that the 120" is completely run down what
                                    there is of it at the front…. The 120" has been put through too
                                    hard all for the Glory of officers. We could have missed this hard campaign if it
                                    had not been for the ambitious officers. Gen. Hovey has resigned because he could
                                    not get another star on his shoulder. I hate the looks of Gen. Hovey….</p>

                        <p>The prisoners are coming in by the thousand and report says we have taken 9000 but we
                                    will call it about 3,000 I think that will do…. I am still laying laying
                                    here in the Exchange Camp in charge of street 11. I sometimes get the blues and wish
                                    I was with the regt and then again I conclude I might as well be satisfied and stay
                                    where I am….</p>

                        <p>There was a call yesterday for all who wanted to go front of the 23" corps.
                                    But I'll hold on a while and see if the weather wont get a little cooler
                                    befor I start front. Then you see I dont much like the way they shoot people out at
                                    the front. They're just as apt to shoot toward a mas as any other way. But
                                    what made me feel worse than any thing else when I was at the front was to set and
                                    listen at a charge on a battery when for a few minutes there was constant hollowing
                                    &amp; shooting both from the Cannon and musketry and then all at once it stoped
                                    and all was as still as death. This awful stillness makes me feel uneasy till I hear
                                    the result, but when I learn that it is in our favor I soon began to feel better.
                                    Fighting near as bad as folks at home think. Still they kill.</p>

                        <p>Capt Brasher of the 120" has come back after all the boys of the Division,
                                    and although I still could have remained here I would rather go up when the call is
                                    made and not stay back and give the boys room to think coward.</p>
                        <p>The Adjutant of this camp refused at first to let me go and leave my street, but at
                                    last he consented and gave me written permission to hunt up all the boys of the
                                    120" that were able and have them ready to go too.</p>
                        <p>Oh! Well! Well!! Well!!! I almost forgot to tell you my reasons for leaving this
                                    place, or as the boys call it, this stinking hole.</p>
                        <p>Wo be unto the Doctors. That is my text and if I preach a hard sermon from it you may
                                    show it to all the Doctors you see and warn them of the dangers to come, for the
                                    latest news here, from below is that the Devil beleiving the doctors has a better
                                    claim than him he has evacuated Hell and given the Doc's undisputed
                                    possession. Having issued his general orders No. 1. constituting of that infernal
                                    place, one immense Doctors office, where by the carelessness of the Dr's
                                    and the ill-timed application of remedies through carelessness and laziness will
                                    greatly augment the punishment of those who[m] they cannot punish sufficiently with
                                    fire….</p>
                        <p>While in Hospital No. 8 there was an immense amount of San-ittary goods furnished the
                                    Hospital for the sick and wounded soldiers. Did they get it? I looked about enough
                                    to see while the poor Soldiers were suffering and <hi rend="i">Dying</hi> for
                                    attention to their wants and were fed the coarsest fare the Dr's fared as
                                    well as they could have procured in Indiana with money, and then lazily lounged
                                    about refusing even to dress the soldiers wounds. I saw sick men dine on boiled beef
                                    and bread and maggots in the beef at that. I havent room to say what the
                                    Dr's had the same day, but all rareties of the season—Crout
                                    &amp;c <hi rend="i">&amp;c.</hi> And at the same time you could have seen a
                                    wounded soldier with maggots in his wounds for want of attention. Wo be unto the
                                    Detors. And still there cometh another woe.</p>
                        <p>I soon got tired of that place and told the Drs I wanted to go to the
                                    regt—they said I could go—but I was stopped out here where I
                                    have remained in charge of street 11. I have had generally from 30 to 50 sick men in
                                    the street for whom I had to get the medicine when the Doctors would prescribe for
                                    them. Of course I saw something of the sick and the Doctors. Now I will tell you
                                    what I seen here.</p>
                        <p>While the men were laying half dead the Dr's would remain away for 3, 4 and
                                    even 7 days without calling to see the sick and if you went to hunt them you might
                                    have to visit every beer saloon in town before you would find them and then likely
                                    so drunk as to be unfit for duty.</p>
                        <p>How would you like to take medicine issued by a Stewart so drunk that his tounge
                                    [sic] was very thick and he could hardly stand. I quit taking their medicines and
                                    soon got better. The Major raked them for staying away and then they would come up
                                    past the Major tents and slip into the back room of the sutlers tent and drink beer
                                        <pb n="205" id="VAA4025-047-2-081"/> (and whisky too) and play cards all day
                                    while the boys were suffering by hundreds for attention. This I know them to do. The
                                    Major has been informed of this also and says he will see too it.</p>
                        <p>Wo! Wo!! unto the Doctors. Soldiers despise them. Of course there are exceptions but
                                    the greater part come into the army for money and because the boys here are mostly
                                    strangers too [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] them and they think it will not injoure them.
                                    They are perfectly reckless of human life and suffering. Put me in the front under
                                    rebel fire rather than in a mean Doctors hands…. They shall reap their
                                    reward…. As I was in command of a street here the sick of course looked
                                    to me to have something done for them. And in lots of cases I have had men to lay
                                    unnoticed when I did not know but they would die in 12 hours and it was impossible
                                    to find a Doctor.</p>
                        <p>And then they would order me to put the men on duty when I knew they were not able.
                                    And taking it all together it made me anxious to get a good chance to get away. I
                                    have now a chance to go [to] the regt on the cars. The regimental baggage and books
                                    are being sent up so that I don't think they will move much longer and the
                                    way I feel I am able for duty and it will be a great deal easier than it is here
                                    now….</p>
                        <p>The Johny's are so discouraged that they wont make a bold stand anymore.
                                    Altogether I think the rebelion is about played out.</p>

                                    suppose I will not get off for 2 or 3 days yet. I was in hopes I would get to the

                        <p>I have drawn Drawers, socks a hat and a fine pair of Pants. So now I have a new suit
                                    all round. My new pants fit me the best of any I ever had. I'm not ready to
                                    go [to the] front, though I am getting afraid the Capt has went back and left me

                        <p>Again I can address you from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. I expected sure to leave here this time sure. Capt. Brasher had
                                    transportation for us <pb n="206" id="VAA4025-047-2-082"/> from this camp, but after
                                    packing our knapsacks and starting down to town, the Major stoped us and told us if
                                    our Captain was wanting us he must come up and show his authority. He made us stop
                                    and stack our arms and wait to see if the cap would come after us. After waiting
                                    awhile I got permission to go down to town to see the cap. but just as I was getting
                                    into town the train left. So you see the Capt left without us and we were left
                                    behind. I asked the major if he did not give me written permission to gather up boys
                                    of the 23" corps. He said he did, but before we could take them away the
                                    capt must come and show his authority. I'm madder than any bull, but now I
                                    might just as well say nothing about it and stay contented. I don't know
                                    now when I will go to the front….</p>
                        <p>Well I suppose you have heard the good news and the bad. They are having a pretty
                                    hard time down at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, but so far as we can learn our troops are successful but we have lost
                                    our old Gen Rosseau who commanded our Corps and the 15" and 16".
                                    But then he did not suffer any more than a high private. Still he was a good
                                    General.</p>
                        <p>The Prisoners and the wounded are coming in. And I guess our men still hold <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. They were sending out some 100 Pounders from here yesterday. That
                                    looks somewhat like a siege…. I have just heard from the front that they
                                    had a small fight last Sunday and took 300 or 400 Prisoners…. Now if
                                    Sherman will just take <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and all the rebs in it and Grant will blow Lee's army and
                                    richmond out of Uncle Sams Domain, I think we will soon see an end to this cruel

                        <p>Well, Well Sarah it may be that they will want the soldiers at home about Election
                                    times to put down this little insurrection up there. Now I just dare them to call
                                    them home for that. Unless the whole Democratic party should raise and then they
                                    might as well call the soldiers all home. Let the South go and whip the Copperheads
                                    half to death yes entirely to death for they deserve 10 deaths to where a southern
                                    rebel deserves one…. I think now Sarah that that disturbance at the north
                                    is the only hope the south has. They look for the North to split up and weaken
                                    themselves so that they <pb n="207" id="VAA4025-047-2-083"/> will be unable to
                                    continue the war next season. If the North does its duty and hangs a lot of those
                                    northern rebs the war will soon wind up—as soon as the South sees that
                                    the Copperheads cant help them.</p>

                        <p>I will tell you how the scurvy works and as much as I know about it, though there are
                                    several different forms of the disease, but it is all called Scurvy, There is one
                                    kind that is closely akin to the rheumatism. That is it hurts just about like it but
                                    generally in the legs. The legs will turn black especially the Calves of the legs,
                                    and the skin on the shin bones gets tight to the bone so you cant shake it. And hard
                                    lump will raise on the shins like the bones were swelling. Then the legs will get
                                    stiff especially the knee joints. Well now that is the kind I am troubled with, but
                                    I have described the worst forms of that kind. I have seen men whose legs were as
                                    black as coal but mine never turned black more than a small patch and that is good
                                    now. My legs do not hurt me now unless I run about all day then it feels like I had
                                    the rheumatism in them. Then they swell some too. But my health is very good and I
                                    am getting fat all the time. I have plenty to eat and nothing to do…. The
                                    scurvy is caused by eating too much salt meat and no vegetables and also by
                                    exposure….</p>
                        <p>I must now tell you about the times here at Katanooger as the citizens call it. Truly
                                    we have had exciting times. The rebs in some force have been tearing up the rail
                                    road down at and about Dalton. Yes and they captured Dalton and a few of our men and
                                    400 head of Uncle Sams Cattle. Well of course you know they got scared here and we
                                    had to all roll out with our rusty guns—us convalescents—to
                                    defend <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. Well we left our guns in the stack to be ready at any time the rebs
                                    might come in, but it so happened that they didnt come so we didnt have to fight!
                                    They sent 5 regts out from here to Dalton and they put down the disturbance. They
                                    put down this little rebellion by a severe charge by the 14 U. S. Colored troops.
                                    The nigs would not take a prisoner but killed every reb. that wanted to
                                    surrender….</p>
                        <p>I was amused to see the citizens here when they were looking for the rebs to come in,
                                    more particularly those butternut Employees of Uncle Sams, who never saw [a] fight.
                                    I was laying over on the hill side in the cool of the evening and hearing folks talk
                                    when 2 Employees came by us fast as they could walk going over to a good place to
                                    see the fight, when they would be safe themselves. I asked them what the news was
                                    down in town and they told me our pickets had been drawn in and that the rebs were
                                    then coming right on to the town. But you see the soldiers knew that was all a lie,
                                    for I was laying where I could see to Rossville, 4 miles away, and the rebs would
                                    have to whip 2 regts of soldiers and 2 pieces of artillery before they could pass
                                    that place. So you see we knew we would hear some noise before the rebs got within 4
                                    or 5 miles of us, but the noise didnt come—nor the rebs either. And then
                                    too we knew (or thought might strong) that the rebs would not attack <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, for if they did they would have to approach the town across a valley
                                    about 3 miles wide and all the time they would be crossing there would be <pb n="208" id="VAA4025-047-2-084"/> about 75 cannon pouring Grape and shell into
                                    them besides our minies from behind the breastworks &amp; we all know the Johnys
                                    are not fond of such charges as that and a cross fire at that….</p>

                        <p>Vegetables are plenty here! Potatoes 2 dollars pr bushel. Apples and peaches plenty
                                    but sell pretty high…. The officer commanding here has made a great
                                    blunder I think. He has issued an order prohibiting soldiers from selling their
                                    rations so I cant get any vegetables at all now without money. I dont think that was
                                    right at all.</p>

                                    how I feel. Though I have no old Handkerchief to tie my head up which perhaps makes

                        <p>So I suppose from your account that the Butternuts are quite mute in Jackson Co. What
                                    do they say about this little affair at <placeName>

                                    </placeName> when Gov Morton got some of their arms and 20000 rounds of ammunition?
                                    What fools they are. Dont they know they will get whipped like dogs? Let them raise
                                    an army of 200,000 if they can and still they could not make a show. It is very true
                                    they might if they could raise that many compell this army to fall back and let the
                                    rebs alone for a while but when it fell back those Butternuts would get the best
                                    threshing they have had for awhile or heard tell of either. It is the general
                                    feeling of the soldiers that if they should have to fall back and leave the rebs
                                    they will whip the butternuts like Dogs anyhow….</p>

                                    </placeName> fever, has he? I think at such times as this when a man can do well in
                                    Ind he had better stay there for it would be a hard time to go west and get fooled
                                    as bad as some have. And then… the Indians might be some trouble. And I
                                    would rather live with rebs than with them. I myself think this is a very good time
                                    for people to stay at home and make a living as best they can but by no means go in
                                    debt for anything for there is sure before long to be considerable change in money
                                    matters….</p>
                        <p>I had forgot to say anything about my health. Well, it is not very good. My back and
                                    legs have kept me pritty still for the last week also I have light fever every
                                    evening which makes me weak, still nothing dangerous. Nothing but the scurvy. The
                                    fever is a kind of slow invalid fever. Not hot like I have had at home but it is now
                                    lighter than it was a few days ago….</p>

            <head>A Very Early Indiana Territorial Letter</head>
            <byline>Henry A. Meyer∗</byline>
            <p>Stamp collectors, two generations ago considered "queer" or
                    "childish" by those who did not feel an interest in their activities, have of late
                    years taken on a new dignity by reason of their having turned their attention to that phase of
                    philately known as "postal history." To pursue this line of study, it is necessary
                    to collect, not used or unused single stamps in an album provided with spaces, but those objects
                    known to collectors as "covers." A "cover," to a philatelist, is
                    the envelope or other enclosure of a letter, bearing an address, sometimes a stamp, and a postmark
                    or other visible evidence of its having passed through the mail. The first national issue of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> postage stamps appeared in 1847, and the use of stamps was made compulsory in 1856;
                    therefore, previous to 1847, and very largely also during the period from 1847 to 1856, the covers
                    collected by philatelists are those known as "stampless covers." More and more
                    collectors are realizing that these stampless covers, sometimes called "pre-stamp
                    covers," are equally as interesting as stamps, and in many cases even more so. There are
                    many philatelists who limit their collecting to stampless covers, and they are among the most ardent
                    postal history students.</p>
            <p>The use of envelopes to contain letters did not become widespread in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> until the early 1850's, and it did not become universal in this country until
                    well after the Civil War. Previous to the use of envelopes, the letter was written on pages 1, 2,
                    and 3 of a large double sheet, leaving page 4, or at least most of it, blank. The letter was then
                    folded in such a manner that page 4 became the outside. The two sides were folded inward; the top
                    and bottom were then folded over the middle portion, and one fold was tucked into the other, thus
                    reducing the whole to a neat rectangle, usually about 3x5 inches or somewhat larger in size. The top
                    and bottom flaps, one of which had been inserted in the other, were sealed, either with sealing wax,
                    or with a prepared "wafer" which could be had at the general store. This wafer was
                    a small circular device, red in color, which was laid between the folds to be sealed, and a hot iron
                    was set <list type="footnotes">

                    letter, very little damage resulted from the manner of sealing; but if the seal was torn hastily, it
                    often made a very unsightly hole in the letter. Letters thus folded, self-contained and sent without
                    an envelope, are called by collectors "folded letters." "Stampless
                    covers" are in a majority of cases also "folded letters" and vice versa,
                    though not universally so.</p>
            <p>"Folded letters" have proved to be a very rich source of original historical
                    material, not only for the postal history student, but also for the student of national, state, and
                    local history. A century ago, when letters were sent and received only rarely, families and business
                    firms saved their entire correspondence, filing it meticulously, either in some sort of homemade
                    filing cabinets, or in large chests in the attic. There it reposed for several generations, until
                    the descendants of the original receivers of the letters found them and did one of three things;
                    destroyed them, as did the priest in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> town; saved them as family heirlooms, which was better than destroying them, but only
                    rarely do letters thus saved become available as historical source material, because those who save
                    them attach to them only a family interest, not a general historical interest; or sold them in bulk
                    to stamp dealers, who retailed them to collectors, who, becoming conscious of their historical
                    value, have either gone into historical research themselves, or have made them available to research
                    students.</p>
            <p>It was through the discarding of old files of correspondence that Professor John C. Andressohn of
                    Indiana University was able to acquire some forty letters of the Rappites relating to their business
                    dealings. It was as a philatelist that the present writer acquired further letters relating to the
                    doings of the Rappites which he made available to Professor Andressohn, who has reported them in
                    supplementary articles.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> It was also as a philatelist that the present writer
                    bought a letter described by the dealer as "a very early Indiana stampless cover"
                    and which turned out to possess considerably more historical than philatelic value. This letter
                    forms the subject of the present article.</p>
            <p>It is indeed a "very early Indiana letter." Letters of the territorial period dated
                    from 1807 onwards are offered occasionally by dealers, but are quite scarce. But the letter <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="211" id="VAA4025-047-2-087"/> here discussed is dated 1801—less than a year and a
                    half after the territory was created. It does not bear an Indiana postmark; if it did, the
                    dealer's price would no doubt have been prohibitive. As was a very common custom in the
                    early 1800's, it was carried privately, by a traveler going that way, as near to its
                    destination as possible, for postage rates at that time were computed by distance.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> As was also a prevailing custom at that time, it was not prepaid, but was sent unpaid, the
                    postage being collected of the addressee. Stamp-less cover collectors rate the scarcity of prepaid
                    letters to letters sent collect as at least ten to one. Therefore as a courtesy to the addressee, it
                    was sent by messenger as far as possible, so that the rate as figured by distance would be
                    reasonable. The letter is addressed to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Hudson</settlement>,
                            <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
               </placeName>, and bears a red
                    "shell" postmark of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. If there chance to be any philatelists among the readers of this article, they know
                    that the "<placeName>

                    </placeName> shell" is a postmark highly prized by collectors, especially when applied in
                    red ink. But the feature which makes this letter of great interest to students of Indiana history is
                    the fact that it was written from the Harrison house in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> by a near relative of the Harrison family, and that it relates to the doings of the
                    family and to events well known to students of the history of the Territory Northwest of the <placeName>

                                be explained. The customary phrase found on old stampless covers is "Politeness

                                Hugenot parents. At seventeen, he went to <placeName>

                                </placeName>, and from there immediately to Montreal, where he joined his uncle in the
                                fur trade. In 1775 he formed a partnership and went west on a fur venture, in which he
                                lost heavily. In 1777 with two partners operating under the title of David McCrae
                                &amp; Company, he again went west. He opened a store in <placeName>

                                </placeName>, while the other two partners opened one in Kas-kaskia. He became a friend
                                of George Rogers Clark, Jean-Gabriel Cerre, Father Gibault, and John Jacob Astor. In
                                1781, Gratiot moved to <placeName>

                                </placeName>, where he married Victoire, the half-sister of Colonel Auguste Chouteau. He
                                traveled repeatedly to <placeName>

                                </placeName>, to the Atlantic seaboard, and to Europe in connection with his business
                                ventures. Besides his fur tradings, he operated a distillery, a tannery, saltworks, and
                                engaged in land dealings. The formal transfer of <placeName>

                                a very logical mind. He prepared his own legal briefs, using French and English equally
                                well. One more feature remains to be studied, namely, the identity of the

                                            was appointed one of the three judges of the Territory Northwest of the <placeName>
                                                <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                            </placeName>. He founded the settlement of North Bend in 1793. He sold many
                                            parcels of the land for which he contracted, but because of a general money
                                            stringency he could not collect, and could therefore not make the payments
                                            for which he was obligated. Jonathan Dayton and Elias Boudinot came to his
                                            financial rescue and he received a patent in 1794 for 311,682 acres which he
                                            had actually paid for. It appears from Mrs. Symmes' statements that
                                            Boudinot by 1801 had turned against Symmes and become one of his several
                                            nemeses. Symmes was quarrelsome and impulsive, careless in financial and
                                            legal matters, and a defendant in many lawsuits. He even sold land which was
                                            not included in his patent. By the time of his death, most of his fortune
                                            had been dissipated; small wonder, when one considers his wife's
                                            statements as to his paradoxical disposition. He did not co-operate fully
                                            with Governor Arthur St. Clair. Yet he planted an important colony and its

                                            Southold, Long Island, he had two daughters, one of whom, Anna Cleves
                                            Symmes, became Mrs. William Henry Harrison. His second wife was Mrs. Mary

            <head>R. Carlyle Buley—Pulitzer Prize Winner</head>
            <p>When the <hi rend="i">Indiana Daily Student</hi> reporter called on Dr. R. Carlyle Buley late Monday
                    afternoon on May 7 for information on the announcement that he had been awarded the Pulitzer Prize
                    in history, he insisted it was a mistake. Several hours later, however, he received a telegram from
                    the committee confirming the news of the reporter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Old Northwest: Pioneer Period, 1815-1840</hi> in two volumes was published by the
                    Indiana Historical Society as part of its contribution to the observance of the Sesquicentennial of
                    Indiana Territory in 1950. Members of the society have had an opportunity to examine these prize
                    winning books and no doubt agree that the committee made a wise choice.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the selection of Professor Buley, a Hoosier and alumnus of Indiana University, as a member
                    of the history faculty of Indiana University by Dr. Albert L. Kohlmeier in 1925 was also fortunate.</p>
            <p>It is only natural, therefore, that the history department of Indiana University should invite the
                    friends of R. C. to a dinner on June 1 to pay tribute to his achievement.</p>
            <p>Dr. Oscar O. Winther as master of ceremonies and brief remarks by President Herman B Wells, Mr. Eli
                    Lilly, Dean Ralph E. Cleland, and Howard H. Peckham added high lights of knowledge and merriment to
                    the occasion. The climax, however, was reached when the guest responded.</p>
            <p>In a number of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> in the near future, a review of <hi rend="i">The Old Northwest</hi> will appear.</p>
            <p>The author, the Lilly Endowment, the Indiana Historical Society, and Indiana University are all to be
                    congratulated for their part in producing these volumes.</p>

            <p>This volume is principally a collection of the <hi rend="i">Journals</hi> of the Indiana General
                    Assembly which have survived from territorial days. It also includes available related documents
                    concerning sessions for which the <hi rend="i">Journals</hi> have been lost such as messages of the
                    governors, memorials, and newspaper circulars. The House <hi rend="i">Journals</hi> for 1806, 1807,
                    and 1810 could not be located, while that of the 1808 session is copied from the <placeName>

                    of 1813-1814, have disappeared. Part of the missing house and council journals may yet come to
                    light, but it is almost certain that some will never be found. The publication of this volume by the
                    Indiana Historical Bureau was "Offered in Observance of the Indiana Territory
                    Sesquicentennial 1800-1950." It was one of the least heralded of the sesquicentennial
                    observances but it will certainly be one of the most permanent.</p>
            <p>The story of the surviving manuscript journals is told in the preface by Howard H. Peckham, Director
                    of the Indiana Historical Bureau. "They were begun in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and finished in Corydon. They were moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and housed in three successive capital buildings. Later some of them were lent to
                    William H. English, congressman, banker, vice-presidential candidate, president of the Indiana
                    Historical Society, and author, who was preparing a history of Indiana. When Mr. English died in
                    1896, his library passed to his son, and upon the latter's death much of the manuscript
                    material went to a nephew who gave it to the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Among the items were found the territorial Journals, which, being Indiana state
                    archives, were returned to Indiana State Library where they now rest. The other surviving Journals
                    remained in the Office of the Secretary of State until they, too, were transferred to the State
                    Library."</p>
            <p>An introduction by John D. Barnhart, chairman of the <pb n="218" id="VAA4025-047-2-094"/> Indiana
                    University department of history, stresses the democratization of the Northwest Ordinance when
                    applied to the Indiana Territory. His thesis is that the substance of <hi rend="i">political
                        democracy</hi> was achieved in Indiana during the territorial era and although the reviewer
                    accepts this thesis he believes that Dr. Barnhart makes Governor Harrison and his friends more
                    democratic than they actually were. Harrison came from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> aristocracy and was originally appointed by Federalist John Adams. He exercised
                    considerable common sense in dealing with territorial leaders who soon ushered in political
                    democracy. With the advent of Jefferson and then <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the presidency, it was absolutely essential for Governor Harrison to co-operate with
                    those who were leaders of the emerging democracy; however, the coming of popular elections and the
                    substance of universal suffrage weakened Harrison's position and brought Jennings and his
                    friends of leadership.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Journals</hi> will not be widely read or used but they will be invaluable to the few
                    who give serious attention to the study and writing of Indiana history. Students of seventeenth
                    century English history will find in these <hi rend="i">Journals</hi> substantial evidence of the
                    results of the political gains of Parliament over the King. They will be reminded anew that American
                    political institutions were bottomed on those of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. Our territorial fathers were made more democratic by the conditions of frontier life,
                    more staunchly republican by their revolutionary heritage and were heirs to a greater extent than
                    they realized of man's struggle in modern times toward self-government. These early
                    legislators were practical men concerned with the advent of political democracy, Indian trade and
                    treaties, the acquisition of land, slavery, finances, defense, local government, separatist
                    territorial movements and related problems. They consciously directed the territorial government
                    toward the goal of statehood, with equal status in the American Union.</p>
            <p>The preface states that: "In transcribing the Journals for publication the original
                    spelling, capitalization, and punctuation for the most part have been maintained; the paragraphing
                    has been altered somewhat to make it conform to a uniform pattern throughout the volume. The ends of
                    the manuscript pages are indicated by asterisks. Raised letters have not been reproduced."
                    The spelling, capitalization, punctuation, <pb n="219" id="VAA4025-047-2-095"/> and paragraphing are
                    part of the original atmosphere and content, and it is unfortunate that such has not been
                    consistently followed or indicated. Despite this criticism even greater emphasis should be given to
                    the editorial work of Misses Dorothy Riker and Gayle Thornbrough. They have obviously devoted
                    innumerable hours to the tedious and wearisome process of assembling and editing the <hi rend="i">Journals</hi> and other documents. The bibliographical and explanatory notes are very helpful;
                    the biographical sketches are useful; and the index is substantial. These aids are more
                    comprehensive and helpful than frequently found in similar volumes. The preservation and publication
                    of such documentary materials is one of the most important functions of the Indiana Historical
                    Bureau.</p>

            <p>Booth Tarkington was probably best known as a novelist. Two of his novels, <hi rend="i">The
                        Magnificent Ambersons</hi> in 1918 and <hi rend="i">Alice Adams</hi> in 1921, won Pulitzer
                    Prizes. After the publication of <hi rend="i">Presenting Lily Mars</hi>, he was awarded the Gold
                    Medal for fiction in 1933 by the National Institute of Arts and Letters. Theatergoers, however, also
                    remember him fondly as the author of <hi rend="i">The Man From Home, Clarence, The Intimate
                        Strangers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This bibliography is a revelation of the great extent of his writings, and the voluminousness of his
                    deep and affectionate probing into and depiction of the American Scene.</p>
            <p>In both plays and novels he was particularly concerned with human beings. His many friendships, among
                    those in all walks of life, were attributed by Erwin Panofsky to his unique insight into human
                    nature: "Instead of respecting a man because he understands his convictions,"
                    Panofsky wrote, "Booth Tarkington respects a conviction, no matter how different from his
                    own, because he understands the man."</p>
            <p>The volume, a handsome example of book-making, is divided <pb n="220" id="VAA4025-047-2-096"/> into
                    four sections. Under the heading of "First Editions" are listed books, ephemera,
                    and contributions, all arranged in chronological order. These cover over two hundred pages.</p>
            <p>The author stated that small space was given to the second section, "Reprint
                    Editions," because so many of the various editions and reprints had been "briefly
                    mentioned with the collations of their first editions."</p>
            <p>In the third section are books, pamphlets, and leaflets about Tarkington arranged in alphabetical
                    order by author. Periodicals also fall within this category.</p>
            <p>The last section is devoted to periodicals and newspapers containing first appearances.</p>
            <p>The book, excellently indexed, is a boon to the thousands of booklovers who already have collected
                    and long will continue to collect Booth Tarkington's ever enjoyable works, from <hi rend="i">Monsieur Beaucaire</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Gentleman From Indiana</hi> to <hi rend="i">Kate Fennigate</hi> and <hi rend="i">Image of Josephine.</hi>

            <p>The reviewer came to the writing of this notice in a state of considerable mental perturbation. He
                    had been told that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> was on the <geogName>Tennessee River</geogName> (p. 31), that the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> was three miles west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>
                    </placeName> (p. 149), that the Louisa was the northern boundary of the Fort Stanwix cession (p. 45,
                    n. 7), that John Floyd was the founder of St. Asaph's (p. 81), and that the original
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Fayette County</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, lay around Boonesborough. He had been irked by the
                    author's habit of referring to Harrod, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName>, and Logan as Jim, Daniel, and Ben and had been apprehensive until the last page that
                    Clark would be called Georgie. He had <pb n="221" id="VAA4025-047-2-097"/> been disturbed by a map
                    (between pages 140 and 141) which misspelled Bryans and showed the Warriors Path grotesquely awry.
                    And he had been exasperated by footnotes wrong (as p. 40, n. 68), footnotes ambiguous (as p. 58, n.
                    23), and footnotes downright incomprehensible (as p. 101, n. 2).</p>
            <p>But all these transgressions he was willing to overlook in his pleasure at having at last a book
                    about James Harrod, telling his story from the beginning of his life to its conjectural end. Until
                    this book appeared one knew little about Harrod beyond the one fact that he was the founder of
                    Harrodstown, the first (if we except Gist's in <placeName>
                        <region reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>) settlement west of the mountains. It is clear after reading the book that this was
                    Harrod's outstanding achievement but it is enough to entitle him to a biography and to our
                    long remembrance. In the course of telling the story of Harrod the author could not avoid telling a
                    goodly part of the story of pioneer <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. We cannot expect, however, that a filial biography of Harrod would render due justice
                    to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName>, Kenton, and Logan; neither can we expect a biography of a Harrodsburg man to concede
                    the importance of Boonesborough or treat Transylvania with dispassion. Offsetting these shortcomings
                    is the author's honesty in conceding Harrod's connivance with the land
                    speculators, in revealing the gossip about his wife, and in acknowledging the mystery of his death.</p>
            <p>The book is written from an extensive bibliography of which the most important item is the Draper
                    Collection. The only thing comparable to this is the Circuit Court Records of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    however, is in itself the work of a lifetime, and it is doubtful if their use would have added
                    significance, although they might have added interest, to the narrative.</p>

            <p>The three essays included in this small volume were presented at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> State University in 1949 forming another <pb n="222" id="VAA4025-047-2-098"/> group in
                    the well-known series of Walter Lynwood Fleming Lectures in Southern History. This study of the
                    activities and accomplishments of the leaders of the shortlived Confederate States of America, in
                    the period following 1865, is interesting and valuable. After reading Dr. Hesseltine's
                    essays, one wonders what a similar treatise dealing with Federal leaders who labored during the
                    period succeeding the Civil War under much less discouraging conditions might reveal.</p>
            <p>In the course of his essays, the author makes it clear that the men who "had led the
                    Confederacy were still the leaders of the Southern people." The truth of this statement is
                    demonstrated by tracing the after-war careers of numerous individuals and through a more general
                    treatment of their part in the creation of a new South. The fact that there was confusion and
                    division among Confederate leaders during the war years is fully accepted, and considerable
                    attention is given to the confusion and division that prevailed among the leaders of the
                    "lost cause" in the new age. The differences in outlook displayed by Robert E. Lee
                    and Jefferson Davis are stressed. This adds a fascinating touch to the lectures, but the high value
                    of the study lies in the patient examination of the parts played by civil and military participants
                    in the slow process of rebuilding the shattered South. The second lecture which is devoted largely
                    to the work of men of the Confederacy in the field of education during the remainder of their lives
                    includes a large amount of new material. In the third lecture, dealing with changing economic
                    conditions as well as with economic reconstruction, the author has grappled with his most difficult
                    problems. This phase of the subject was, of course, interlaced with politics.</p>
            <p>Readers will find these new essays in Southern history absorbing and instructive. The failure of the
                    South to achieve independence could not alter the fact that the effort to form the Confederacy was a
                    big undertaking. Circumstances made it necessary for nearly all of the middle-aged and younger
                    Confederate leaders to spend many years in the South after <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It is greatly to their credit that they performed so well in the midst of discouraging
                    conditions. It is true that the industrialization of the North had not gone very far by 1861, and
                    that there were evidences of the coming of a new South before the four years of military conflict.
                    In other <pb n="223" id="VAA4025-047-2-099"/> words, the leaders of the post-bellum South were aided
                    by the continuing economic advance of the North and by the fact that some steps in the creation of a
                    different South were being taken before the formation of the Confederacy. It should also be
                    remembered that some of the evils of industrialism that Southerners felt the effects of, and cried
                    out against before 1861, during the war years and later, were not peculiar to the North. A fast
                    changing economic system accompanied by prosperity and the rapid accumulation of capital plus the
                    might that inheres in such developments will profoundly influence any area to which it may
                    come—even the New South.</p>

            <p>Books dealing with regions, their lakes, rivers, mountains, folklore, have been appearing steadily.
                    This effort to dissect America's past by means of a close examination of its separate parts
                    is a commendable one, for the works of synthesis which result are proving exceedingly useful to the
                    student of history and enlightening to the general reader.</p>
            <p>In this work, Professor Winther is concerned with the economic beginnings of the old <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> country as is indicated by its subtitle; but the scope of the book is wider than is
                    suggested by the phrase, "Trade, Transportation, and Travel." It is, in fact, a
                    survey of the region's development during its formative period. The author describes the
                    primitive state of the country before the invasion by white men, and explains its attraction to
                    European nations and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in terms of the link which is provided in the lucrative <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName> trade.</p>
            <p>The Northwest Company was the first organization in the area. While exploiting the fur-bearing
                    resources, its men explored and helped to map out the region. Then came the Hudson's Bay
                    Company, which, in the Northwest was virtually synonymous with the name of John McLaughlin, its
                    chief <pb n="224" id="VAA4025-047-2-100"/> factor. The story continues with the Yankee penetrations,
                    made possible by explorers like Captain Gray and fur merchants like John Jacob Astor; the decline of
                    the fur trade; the coming of American missionaries; the great tide of settlers who hacked out trails
                    across a continent. Communities required organized means of transportation and all phases and stages
                    are dealt with: pack trains, stage coaches, paddle wheels, steamships, and finally railroads.</p>
            <p>Professor Winther has done a first-class job. He has treated his subject with exhaustive thoroughness
                    and a careful regard for fact and detail. Government documents, manuscripts, fugitive pamphlet
                    literature, periodicals, books, and newspapers have all been drawn upon, and it is apparent that the
                    research centers of the west coast have been combed to obtain the maximum authenticity and provide
                    originality for his work.</p>
            <p>One need not endorse the excessive claim of the publisher that "here the whole story of
                    trade and travel in the region is told for the first time" to agree that here is a
                    comprehensive and skillful treatment of the subject. A little more space devoted to the life and
                    activities of the people, the inclusion of more anecdotal material would have enlivened the book and
                    perhaps the style.</p>

            <p>On the surface, <hi rend="i">Here They Once Stood</hi> is a detailed bit <pb n="225" id="VAA4025-047-2-101"/> of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> history brought into focus for a minute and of local interest and importance. The book
                    treats the most important decade and a half (1693-1708) of the broader period of Franciscan <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>. It builds up to 1704 and the raid of James Moore of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> against the Spanish missions in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> and centers its attention specifically on one of these establishments, the San Luis
                    mission. Historically this raid of Colonel Moore started the decline of a prosperous and promising
                    group of thirty-four Franciscan missions in the area between St. Augustine (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>) and St. Catherine's Island (<placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>). I believe the book justifies itself on the basis of this local history alone, aside
                    from other considerations.</p>
            <p>I suggest that there are several aspects of broad importance that grow out of the local and I should
                    like to mention three of them: 1) The lack of tangible ruins and evidence of Franciscan missionary
                    endeavor in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> should not blind us to Spanish activity in that general area. Simply because Franciscan
                    missions remain as splendid and imposing evidence of their labor in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> but have completely disappeared in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> we must not lose our sense of historical proportions and dismiss the activity in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> the while remembering that in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. The Franciscans were not exclusively "Californianos." We may rejoice
                    with the preservation in the southwest but let us always bear in mind the whole picture. There is a
                    far greater debt to <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> in our southeast than merely the founding of St. Augustine, the oldest settlement in
                    continental <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. I believe <hi rend="i">Here They Once Stood</hi> will help dispel some of the
                    confusion suggested above. 2) The great impact of Anglo-Saxon culture on present-day <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> must not completely push out from our histories the fact that the Spanish activities,
                    settlements, Indian relations, etc., antedate it by a comfortable span of years. That this Spanish
                    heritage is more obvious in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> and the southwest is in itself justification for monographical works such as <hi rend="i">Here They Once Stood.</hi> Besides making the whole more truthful the proper
                    recognition of Spanish penetration will make the Anglo-Saxon emergence the more glorious rather than
                    dim it. How can the English colony of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, for example, be appreciated and understood if one fails to consider its
                    "buffer" value against the Spanish in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>? I fear that all too often this point <pb n="226" id="VAA4025-047-2-102"/> is missed or
                    grossly underestimated. 3) One other broad consideration I would like to mention is inter-department
                    or inter-discipline co-operation in studies of this sort. History and archaeology (in this case) can
                    be mutually helpful in a dignified way with neither "sinking" to the handmaiden
                    role.</p>
            <p>The book as written would be attractive to one already interested in this narrow subject matter.
                    However, to reach a wider audience the authors' excessive use of direct quotations is a
                    handicap. It makes for jerky rather than smooth continuity and the average reader might too easily
                    become disassociated.</p>
            <p>In connection with point three above, it might be pointed out that the attractive aspects of
                    co-operation between history and archaeology are somewhat offset by questionable ones. The historian
                    might easily be a bit irked by the details of digging trenches to locate old moats, etc.
                    Correspondingly, the dedicated archaeologist might see but little sense in or justification for the
                    time and effort expended on the historical material. Happily, I should say, the greatest danger of
                    this has been avoided in <hi rend="i">Here They Once Stood</hi> by the authors separating the
                    material so that they evaluate and describe historically for the first ninety-five pages and then
                    excavate with a vengeance for the additional sixty pages.</p>
            <p>From a scholar's point of view the copious use of footnotes and sources is a delight. The
                    holy (or unholy) reverence for sources receives more than its pound of flesh. There is virtually
                    nothing but source materials and those translated from the Spanish or handed down orally by the
                    Indians.</p>
            <p>A word should be said for the very attractive format and binding. If this is typical of the care
                    taken by the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> Press, it should have a period of growth ahead of it.</p>
            <p>I wish I might be right in saying that <hi rend="i">Here They Once Stood</hi> represents a trend in
                    worthy attention and interest being bestowed on "local history." It is from the
                    details of the local that the bigger scene and outlines must come. An incident in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> with proper treatment becomes a significant detail in the <placeName>

            <p>There can be little doubt that Mr. Basil Cozens-Hardy has rescued Dr. Sylas Neville (1741-1840) from
                    obscurity, and that once more a man destined apparently in his own times "to dumb
                    Forgetfulness a prey" has through a diary of which he in part was ashamed earned for
                    himself a place in history. Although Sylas Neville cannot be considered as "a village
                    Hampden" or "some mute inglorious <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName>" raised to "a place of fame and elegy" by a twentieth
                    century Thomas Gray, his history will be read "in a nation's eyes."
                    Henceforth all serious students of the broader social and cultural aspects of eighteenth century <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> will be forced to consult this book along with the diary of James Woodforde, that
                    magnificent country parson, and the journal of James Boswell, biographer of Sam Johnson and <placeName>

                    </placeName> clubman. With the latter the Neville diary has much in common. Neville and Boswell both
                    had Scottish connections, were born within a year of each other, kept daybooks covering certain
                    years in the first decade of the reign of George III, and had printed editions of their long lost
                    manuscripts appear in 1950. The publishing of Boswell's <hi rend="i">

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>From the pages of the latter come the intimate thoughts and observations of a pronounced Whig,
                    professional sponger, man about town, squire, medical student, traveler, and physician. Born perhaps
                    under the bar sinister, Neville during the period covered by his diary spent one year in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>, two years at Scratby near Yarmouth where he attempted to play the role of a squire,
                    thirteen years at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Edinburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> and elsewhere studying to be a doctor, and five years at Norwich indifferently
                    practicing medicine. It was at the latter place he died in 1840, but there is no indication that he
                    continued his diary after 1788. Perhaps he was too busy begging money from his friends to write, for
                    he was always in bad financial circumstances. In between times he traveled extensively and drifted
                    through life. As Mr. Cozens-Hardy <pb n="228" id="VAA4025-047-2-104"/> states, "It is sad
                    to reflect that a man of such culture and ability should have passed through this world without
                    adding anything to its progress and wealth" (p. xiv). The editor might have added that
                    Neville, read in many things and wise in none, had an inflated ego and caddish temperment which was
                    as much to blame for his ill success in life as were the various female connections with which he
                    burdened himself (p. xii).</p>
            <p>Neville the man is a fascinating study and as such the publication of this would be worth while. The
                    book is also living history, and delightfully records the views of a left wing Whig during the reign
                    of George III. Neville was ready to believe every sort of rumor against those with whom he disagreed
                    politically, and time and time again that little republican heart of his colored his reason and
                    warped his judgment. To him Grenville was "an arch-Tory," Bute, the
                    "paramour of George's mother" who was planning to make himself King,
                    Dundee, "an arch-persecutor," Monck, "a traitor," Fox,
                    "that arch-patriot Secretary," etc. His own status led him to oppose British laws
                    of primogeniture, and his purse lined him up against coddling the poor. As he grew older he tempered
                    his republicanism (p. xiii) which was more intellectual than anything else. He would have had much
                    in common with modern "parlor pinks" and "cocktail party reds"
                    who love the masses in general but not in the particular. Once after inviting all newly married
                    couples in the neighborhood to tea, Neville commented, "Every person ought to be civil to
                    those in inferior rank" (p. 184). On all January 30's he ate calves head to
                    signify he approved that the men of the Commonwealth had executed Charles I, and he took great
                    delight in such democratic gestures.</p>
            <p>Neville, little, mean, filled with a sense of his own importance, was a hypocrite. His
                    self-righteousness was at times nauseous. "Mrs. Willoughby said to me 'You are
                    able to seduce any woman' Heaven forbid that I should seduce any woman from her
                    virtue" (p. 67). At the time of writing he was preparing for his mistress to come live with
                    him. Shortly thereafter he argued with her over the way she was rearing her child by another affair
                    and moaned: "How miserable is the situation of a bachelor exposed to all the bad humours of
                    low life, deprived of those real joys which a virtuous &amp; well-educated wife afford"
                    (pp. 85-86). He broke with a fellow <pb n="229" id="VAA4025-047-2-105"/> student, Thomas Baker, who
                    dared suggest that he treat his mistress better, and he made nasty comments about the morals of
                    Baker's mistress. He thundered forth against newspapers allowing men to advertise for women
                        companions—<hi rend="i">Saturday Review of Literature</hi>, take heed! Yet he could
                    marry off his beloved Sally to his man servant for purposes of keeping up appearances of morality
                    with the neighbors. The diary is loaded with moral strictures, but that nasty little mind of his
                    could not free itself from thoughts of the opposite sex. Some events and places made more lasting
                    impressions because of the pretty ladies present than for any other reason. In some ways
                    Boswell's hyper-animal spirits are refreshing when compared with Neville's
                    freudian drives. His life was a series of attempts to enjoy the fruits of matrimony without its
                    burdens and responsibilities.</p>
            <p>Neville consistently informed his diary that people considered him the finest horseman they had seen
                    and that he had great prowess on skates and with women. There seems little doubt that he
                    was—if he so desired—a witty and interesting conversationalist, but he reminds
                    us that person after person was not fit to talk to him. Scholars might tire of his boasting about
                    his erudition, but graduate students will be shocked to learn that he told college authorities that
                    his dissertation was his own work, but that he could not say the same for some of the classmates.
                    Nevertheless, he was keen and observing and a man of varied tastes. He could be interested in
                    everything from politics to nature, from industrial development in the west of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> to medical science in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Holland</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Unlike so many diaries, Neville's is not centered in any one locale, and will
                    be of great importance to any understanding of life outside <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. The editor omitted publishing seven volumes covering a Continental tour, and it is to
                    be hoped that those volumes will be published at some future date.</p>
            <p>Three examples from the diary itself will do more than anything else to show Neville's style
                    and his ability. On Garrick playing Hamlet he wrote: "The expression in his features, his
                    eyes particularly, surpass anything I ever saw. He is a little man, but handsome and full of that
                    fire which makes the stronger, and of the softness natural to the tender passions" (p. 99).
                    While traveling he recorded the following: "Left Dumbarton at 6 o'cl. &amp;
                    passing through a pleasant <pb n="230" id="VAA4025-047-2-106"/> highland country soon came in sight
                    of the celebrated Lake, the principle object of our journey, &amp; indeed a fine one: The vast
                    expanse of water with its islands &amp; surrounding mountains present a picture of the grand
                    &amp; beautiful not to be described. Many of the islands are covered with verdure &amp;
                    small trees which form a fine contrast to the black and barren mountains on each side" (p.
                    209). "From <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Garstang … saw many Lancashire witches, i.e. pretty girls, on the road
                    since we have been in this country, where the women are indeed remarkable handsome. Had a most
                    comfortable supper at Gardner's (The Royal Oak) Garstang which is one of the best (at least
                    most agreable) houses upon the road—everything good—people obliging etc. We
                    could not help taking notice of a most elegant Necessary, in which one might drink tea with more
                    comfort than in a Scotch parlour; a tank of water directly under the seats keeps everything
                    perfectly clean and sweet" (p. 250-251).</p>
            <p>The transcribing of the diary offered some difficulties for the editor because Neville used code,
                    Italian, and Aldridge shorthand to record things he wished kept quiet. Mr. Cozens-Hardy has made
                    some interpretations, but he has also excluded material which was too "indelicate to be
                    printed" (p. xv). He is to be congratulated for the former action, and condemned for the
                    latter. The editing job is not as thorough as that performed by Professor Pottle on
                    Boswell's <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                        </placeName> Journal</hi>, and Mr. Cozens-Hardy's treatment of the mechanics of
                    scholarship leaves much to be desired. He points out in his introduction, "There is an
                    admitted danger of over-footnoting, but I must bear in mind the possibility that this work may find
                    its way into the hands of some who are unfamiliar with even the major characters in English history
                    and with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> topography" (p. xvi). Admittedly he has a point, but one wonders why many
                    obscure items have no explanation while common words such as "post-chaise" and
                    "phaeton" draw a footnote even though they can be found defined in any adequate
                    dictionary. An item on page 110 mentions a Dr. John Jebb, Lord Oxford, and Swift, with the latter
                    receiving a note and not the other two. Surely the "unfamiliar" would be apt to
                    know more about Swift than the others. Similar examples can be cited. Not always does the note
                    appear when the item is mentioned in the text for the first time. Neither in the notes nor in the
                    index does the <pb n="231" id="VAA4025-047-2-107"/> reader discover who the king of <placeName>
                        <country reg="dk">Denmark</country>
                    </placeName> was, but there is an explanation of a classical allusion made by Neville about
                    Christian VII. Perhaps by a series of brief biographical sketches at the beginning of the book and
                    by full index items with explanatory phrases Mr. Cozens-Hardy might have solved his footnoting
                    problems as did Professor Pottle.</p>
            <p>There are items when it appears that Mr. Cozens-Hardy is woefully lacking in an overall knowledge of
                    the period, or at least in his bibliography. To use Lord Brougham's dated account of Pitt
                    and the pension furor instead of the more recent studies by Brian Tunstall and the late Basil
                    Williams fits the editor's text with Neville's Whig ideas, but leaves the
                    erroneous impression that Pitt after taking pension and peerage was finished politically. In reality
                    his illness was more responsible for his temporary political eclipse than either peerage or pension.
                    The note on Grenville (p. 28) is stated in such a way that one wonders if Mr. Cozens-Hardy thought
                    that the Stamp Act prime minister was a Tory. Often the thought occurs to this reviewer that if the
                    editor knew something about an item or if the person was in the <hi rend="i">Dictionary of National
                        Biography</hi>, it was annotated. If not, no matter how obscure it might be, it was ignored.</p>
            <p>Whatever the minor editorial shortcoming, the discovery of the manuscript, the transcribing, and the
                    printing of the <hi rend="i">Diary of Sylas Neville</hi> is a real historical contribution. American
                    readers will be gratified by Neville's great sympathy for the American colonies during the
                    American Revolution and will be rewarded by the understanding of a man and his era as is afforded by
                    this book. Mr. Cozens-Hardy and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> University Press are to be most highly congratulated for bringing forth a work rich in
                    history and in entertainment, and it is to be hoped that we will be able to hear more about Dr.
                    Neville, either through the publishing of those volumes treating his Continental tour or by an
                    edition of the letters which the editor used while preparing the diary for publication. May we ask,
                    however, that censorship and deletions be avoided and that more attention be paid to the mechanics
                    of editing. As a single book of historical information, the <hi rend="i">Diary of Sylas Neville</hi>
                    is every bit as important as the more highly publicized and ballyhooed first volume of the <hi rend="i">

            <p>A characteristic aspect of the politics of the last century has been the increasing necessity for any
                    kind of government to be a government by consent. Open absolutism, contemptuously relegating the
                    masses of the people to a negligible status, has virtually disappeared. Whether a government be a
                    dynamic totalitarian dictatorship whipping up its subjects to the emotional fervor necessary for the
                    accomplishment of the tasks laid upon them, or a reactionary regime conducted in the exclusive
                    interest of certain privileged groups, it must still try to persuade the people that it has their
                    interests at heart. Even democratic states are becoming to an ever greater extent laboratories for
                    ruthless political propaganda. In their more dangerous aspects, modern propaganda methods and
                    devices—and I do not mean only those originating in the Marxist bloc of
                    countries—manifestly threaten the intellectual integrity of the citizen and the freedom
                    of speech and judgment without which liberal civilization cannot survive.</p>
            <p>As the first popular dictator of modern times, Emperor Napoleon I bears a large share of the
                    responsibility for originating this monstrous thing called modern political propaganda. He was well
                    aware of the need to win and hold popular support. He developed considerable skill in cajoling,
                    exhorting, explaining, vilifying, misleading, and, occasionally, enlightening. As Professor Holtman
                    says (p. 246): "Why … was Napoleon's propaganda activity important?
                    Because he made two real contributions to the development of propaganda. He was the first sovereign
                    to talk to his subjects directly and frequently, partly through mediums such as the bulletins and
                    orders of the day, which he was the first to exploit; and in his utilization of the machinery of
                    government, he took a pioneering step towards systematic official propaganda activity of the type we
                    know today. In these two momentous categories Napoleon stands as the first modern
                    propagandist."</p>
            <p>Familiar with modern studies of propaganda techniques and characteristics in general, Professor
                    Holtman has worked through a vast quantity of contemporary publications, memoirs, and secondary
                    works, to emerge with a clear presentation of the method and content of Napoleonic propaganda. <pb n="233" id="VAA4025-047-2-109"/> His critical "Essay on Authorities" and the
                    abundant, detailed footnotes indicate the impressive scope of his research. This work will be very
                    valuable to the student of the Napoleonic period. It will also be useful reading for the thoughtful
                    person who wishes to trace the origin of the frightening modern art of misrepresentation.</p>

            <p>Rachel Harness Whitman, wife of Matthew Rogers Luce, on August 23, 1916, wrote an account for her
                    grandchildren of the journey which the Luce family made to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> in 1849. Her father-in-law had decided to make the trip by water and so on October 1,
                    1849, the Luce family of ten started out from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, on the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. At the first town in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, which was Greenville, they met a family from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. After a short stay with these Hoosiers, they went on to Seguin where they
                    arrived on March 4, 1850. For the summer the Luce family moved to a small colony on the Cibolo River
                    and in the fall settled at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lockhart</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>

            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>In the year of 1849 quite a number of citizens of <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Warrick County</region>
                        </placeName>, Indiana, made up their minds to move to <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                        </placeName>, and as my father-in-law, Abner Luce, Sr., had visited <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                        </placeName> twice to look over the country to see if it would do to move to, of course they all
                        came to him, and as he was delighted with the country they all sold out to come in that year. A
                        long train of wagons started with banners up for <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                        </placeName>.</p>
                    <p>My father-in-law could not get off till later and was coming by water, the leaders of this crowd
                        agreed to meet at <placeName>
                     <settlement type="city">Seguin</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                  </placeName>. They begged Father Luce to send all the ladies
                        with them but he would not agree to it, and he regretted very much before we got here that he
                        had not consented to it.</p>
                    <p>On the first of October 1849 we all pushed out from <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Newburgh</settlement>
                        </placeName>, Indiana, on the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. There were no immigrants in the
                        crowd, just Father Luce and his family consisting of his sons, Matthew R., Sam, Frank and David,
                        all grown, and <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                        </placeName>, twelve years old—and the ladies were myself, my mother-in-law, and
                        Misses Elizabeth and Ariminta Luce.</p>
                    <p>As Father had three what we called flat bottomed boats he hired several hands to come with us. We
                        had one colored servant. I had one baby, who is now Mrs. A. A. Ellison of <placeName>
                     <settlement type="city">San Antonio</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                  </placeName>. She and myself are the only living ones of our crowd that left for <placeName>

                        </placeName>.</p>
                    <p>Father and sons had one boat load of livestock and produce. When we went down to <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                        </placeName> to sell it he rented a field to turn his horses into and left us at a place called
                        Gainslanding, several miles below the mouth of Red River. He had bought about one hundred head
                        of the finest horses he could find on which he lost money. He thought he would fill this country
                        with fine horses but the people preferred their <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                        </placeName> ponies and there was no sale for fine horses.</p>

                    <p>Father Luce made the town of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Newburgh</settlement>
                        </placeName>, Indiana. In early times he settled there and the place was called Sprinklesburg.
                        Father laid off a new town and called it <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Newburgh</settlement>
                        </placeName>. He was a leading citizen of that place and when the news went round that we were
                        going to start for <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                        </placeName>, many were the friends and kin folks to see us off. I think every one near there
                        was on the bank of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> to wave us a farewell. We could see for
                        three miles then the river made a turn and they were still standing there. It looked like a
                        white cloud, waving a last farewell.</p>
                    <p>We had a pleasant trip down the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> and down the
                            <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>. Sometimes steamboats knew who we were and would come
                        near to wave us goodbye. As well as I remember, before we stopped at Gainslanding they paid off
                        three Captains, one hundred dollars apiece, and they took a steamboat and went back.</p>
                    <p>Father Luce took two hands and David and went on down with the stock boat and we lived in our
                        boat for six weeks. There were rich people there and the old planters were acquainted with
                        Father and he told them he left us in their care. We certainly had a gay time. I saw more
                        champaign drunk than I ever did before, most too much. Some of their cakes were baked in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                        </placeName>. We went to a party nearly every night and there I did my last dancing. My husband
                        did not dance but he would hold the baby and let me dance. A lady said : "I know why
                        your husband is so kind to you. He knows he is taking you where you will never see anything but
                        Indians."</p>
                    <p>Well, Father came back. He took the horses and put them back in the boat then tied the boat to
                        our boat and hired a steamboat back to the mouth of Red River, as flatboats do not run up
                        stream. When we got to the mouth of Red River they took two of the horses out of the boat and as
                        the river had a levee on each side and a flat road on top, they tied our boat and the
                        horses' boat together, put a horse on each levee and tied them to our boats with ropes
                        and we started up stream. We traveled fast as the horses were wanting out. They fairly ran and
                        we went a little faster than we liked but each horse had a young man to ride on his back to keep
                        him from going too fast. We went back that way until we got to Bayou Lafouch, then they put
                        their horses in the boats again, and all the men got on the boats with spikes to keep us from
                        striking shore, and started down that Bayou like a hericane. The river was very high and running
                        swiftly and the people along the shore did not know what it meant. The hired men said that it
                        was the most dangerous piece of work they had ever seen.</p>
                    <p>We got to a big plantation in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                        </placeName> where there was what was called a <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                        </placeName> Road. Father and sons had prepared for our trip on land by bringing along four
                        wagons that had never been put together. One was a four horse wagon and one buggy with double
                        covers and new harness, and everything new right from the shop. They took the wagons off the
                        boats and it took the men quite a while to put them all up, to put on the bows and covers which
                        were made in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                        </placeName>. They were made so that not a drop of rain could get in. The people said they had
                        never seen such a turn out before. It was a pretty, warm afternoon when they got everything
                        ready to start. They concluded to go out as far as they could that evening to see how the horses
                        would go. They went pitching. <pb n="236" id="VAA4025-047-2-112"/> The four horse wagon was the
                        baggage wagon, it had our tent in it. We got out eight or ten miles and put up our tent for the
                        night, for the men to sleep in. The ladies slept in the wagons. When we got up the next morning
                        it was raining and it rained for twenty-one days. I do not mean all the time, but showers every
                        day.</p>
                    <p>We were in the pine woods and had to stay in the road or we would mire up. We finally got to the
                        Sabine River and each one wanted to be the first one to cross and say they were the first to be
                        in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                        </placeName>.</p>
                    <p>The Sabine was high. All the bottoms were covered with water. We had to be ferried five miles;
                        that is, we got into the ferry boat and went down stream five miles, then landed. As the ferry
                        boat could only carry one boat load at a time, and as it took a day for each trip, we were there
                        for several days. The horses had to be ferried over, too. It all took time. After we got over we
                        were in a wilderness. A man came to our tent and said he could save us forty miles of travel. He
                        had a private way which he sold to Father and which we afterwards found was the worst way. It
                        was a foolish bargain. We were well fixed for travel and the forty miles around were good roads,
                        the one we took was too low and poor.</p>
                    <p>The first town we saw in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                        </placeName> was Greenville. There we met a family from <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                        </placeName>, Indiana. The man was a dentist and we stayed there to let him fix some of our
                        teeth. We crossed the Brazos River at <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Huntsville</settlement>
                        </placeName>. After we got out of the Pine Woods we had a pleasant drive. We often spoke of our
                        friends that started before we did and wondered how many we would see when we got to Seguin
                        where we were to meet agreeable to promise. We had never heard from them or they from us, and on
                        the fourth day of March 1850 we drove into Seguin and to our sorrow found but few of the crowd
                        to welcome us. They were so happy to see us. They were afraid we had been lost. So many of their
                        party had dropped out on the way, some at one place and some at another. The families we met
                        there were J.J. Thornton, George Day, Horace Neely, a Mr. Houchens, and two Nortons, and there
                        might have been others but these are all I remember. They told us about a pleasant trip they
                        had. They came through Indian Territory and were delighted here.</p>
                    <p>We moved to a small colony on the Cibolo River for the summer. We found nice people there. It was
                        about eighteen miles from San Antonio where we had left word for our mail to be sent. So the
                        next thing was to hear from the folks at home. No one could go alone on account of the Indians,
                        but a company was soon made up and went and brought back so much mail. The Postman had been told
                        to keep our mail till we called for it.</p>
                    <p>I am writing this for my grand children, and if I were a good writer I would like to write them a
                        book on the same subject but as this is the best I can do, will stop. I forgot to tell that when
                        we were at Gainslanding, Father took our furniture and household things to <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                        </placeName> and shipped them across the Gulf to Indianola. It was late in summer when we got
                        them, some were lost that we never got. It was foolish for us to have shipped so much. I had a
                        hundred <pb n="237" id="VAA4025-047-2-113"/> dollar parlor stove that was ruined before we got a
                        cabin to put it in, but our carpets and such things were useful. My nicest carpet I used for a
                        partition in the first house I lived in. Father Luce knew we were bringing too much but he was
                        afraid to tell us for fear we all would not come. He would say: "Bring all you want,
                        and I will pay the freight."</p>
                    <p>Well, in the fall of 1850 we moved to <placeName>
                     <settlement type="city">Lockhart</settlement>,
                                <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                  </placeName>, and I have lived here
                        continuously ever since. Some of the colony moved here too and were our dear neighbors. Of
                        course all the old ones have passed away, but some of their grand children live here yet and
                        feel near to me. I forgot to mention that Father Luce had a sister who came to Gainslanding with
                        us. She said she could not bear to see us leave so she took her son, Thomas, who was quite a
                        handsome young man and gay. Aunt Hettie Everton was very pious. She made them tie up the boats
                        on Sundays, and she would call all into the boats and have prayers, much to the annoyance of the
                        three Captains. She wanted singing, but as there were no singers in the crowd but the Captains
                        and myself, and as the Captains were mad to have to stop on Sunday, we did not have music. This
                        Thomas Everton in after years moved to <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
