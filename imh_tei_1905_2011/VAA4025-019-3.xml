            <p>To the book-lover all libraries with their shelves of alluring titles, with their
                    musty old books tucked away in basements, hold a fascination, but the old
                    library in a small town which traces its ancestry through the Civil war, through
                    the first library movement in the state, back to the very roots of the existence
                    of the town itself must hold interest even for the person who cherishes no
                    special affection for books or their abiding-places.</p>
            <p>In the year 1833 a little embryo village was surveyed and laid out in the
                    north-western corner of the state of Indiana, where a gap in the dense, primeval
                    forest invited the Indians and French to seek a gateway through the timber from
                    one part of the prairie to another, and was poetically named <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">La Porte</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>It augured well for the literary aspirations of the infant settlement that in the
                    second winter, 1834-5, the few villagers should contribute of their scanty hoard
                    toward a common book-fund. To <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> went the fund; back slowly over pioneer trails came a few books to
                    swell the library already donated from the settlers' personal libraries
                    to the rather remarkable total of nearly three hundred volumes. The books were
                    carefully listed and the library proudly installed in a corner of the office of
                    John B. Niles, the one attorney the place boasted, under the nominal charge of
                    an Englishman <pb n="210" id="VAA4025-019-3-002"/> by the name of Whittam. Some
                    of Cooper's <hi rend="i">Leatherstocking Tales</hi> and
                    Lytton's <hi rend="i">Last Days of Pompeii</hi> indicate sufficiently
                    the choices of the day, while the only periodical was The Dial, later the chief
                    organ of the Transcendalists.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There then comes a long gap, during which the settlers apparently dropped their
                    cooperative effort, possibly because they were more absorbed in exercising the
                    muscles of their bodies in wrestling with the soil and with primitive conditions
                    than in exercising the muscles of their brains. But in the midst of the Civil
                    war the beginnings of the present library are to be found. Although boasting
                    nearly eight thousand inhabitants, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">La Porte</settlement>
                    </placeName> was without a reading-room or library, except the McClure
                        library,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> to which so few had access that it was
                    practically without influence on the community. A few choice souls, under the
                    impetus of the pastor of the Presbyterian church, determined to organize an
                    institution "to be influential in developing a literary taste by
                    cultivating a habit of reading, to stimulate the mind by promotnig learning, and
                    to furnish a pleasant and useful place of resort."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                    The effort awakened such enthusiasm that by March 16, 1863, five hundred dollars
                    had been subscribed. On that date the subscribers met in the Grammar School
                    building and effected an organization of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">La Porte</settlement>
                    </placeName> Reading-Room and Library Association by the adoption of a
                    constitution and by the election of officers and directors.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The prompt opening of negotiations with the other library association in the town
                    necessitates a rather lengthy digmasion, which is justified by the link thus
                    established between the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">La Porte</settlement>
                    </placeName> library and the first library movement in the Central
                    Westâ€”a movement of far more than passing or local interest.</p>

                    factory town renowned as the happiest mill community in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, turned to the new world to try out a communistic colonization
                    scheme which he believed was to inaugurate a "new moral
                    world." He purchased thirty thousand acres of land at <placeName>

                    </placeName> on the lower <geogName>Wabash river</geogName> in Posey county,

                    have a vast theatre to try out his social reforms.</p>
            <p>Among the eminent men of science<hi rend="sup">6</hi> whom Owen gathered about
                    himself, was William McClure,<hi rend="sup">7</hi> a man of large means, who had
                    traveled far and wide, and who had a deep knowledge of science. Owen gave
                    McClure sole charge of the educational part of his reforms, while McClure, on
                    his side, joined whole-heartedly in the experiment by investing
                    $150,000 and agreeing to focus his plans for educational work in
                    America about Harmony under the Pestalozzian system. The two men shared the
                    ideal of devotion to the improvement of the conditions of the lowly. Although

                    confined at first to railroad men. After the library had been kept for some time

            <p>On May 11, 1863, the board of directors submitted their first report to the
                    association, finding much cause for encouragement in the possession of seven
                    hundred volumes and twenty-nine newspapers, magazines, and reviews and in the
                    occupation of the up-stairs rooms to which the Institute had removed in the vain
                    hope of a renaissance and which the new association had taken over.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this encouragement seems scarcely to have been justified, as there were long

                        1864.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> The old officers were discouraged, but
                    determined not to stand in the way of others who might be able to give new
                    vitality to the organization and so on December 6, 1864, the officers and board
                    resigned in a body to allow of the election of new. With the new blood there is
                    unmistakable indication of new vigor. The board immediately appointed a

                    January of 1868 a fire starting from the carelessness of the masons with their
                    stove on the third floor of the post-office building resulted in damages to the
                    property of the association in the room below to the extent of five hundred
                    dollars. By that year the association had also outgrown the narrow confines of
                    its original objects. It declared its purposes to be, in addition to the
                    maintenance of a library: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            furnish such other means of instruction and improvement as may be

            <p>The library made yet one more move before it came into permanent quarters of its
                    own. When Dr. S. B. Collins erected his marble front building in 1871, he
                    offered to the Library Association the free use of the five rooms of his third
                    story for five years. The offer, accepted with alacrity and gratitude, provided
                    spacious quarters for just about six months, for by July 1, 1872, Dr. Collins
                    gave notice that he needed the rooms for his business, offering one hundred
                    dollars a year toward the payment of rental elsewhere.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This early period from 1864 to 1874 is, in some senses, the most interesting and
                    most brilliant period of the history of the library. Life membership fees were
                    fixed first at fifty dollars, which did not exempt holders from possible
                    assessments of one dollar a year and later at one hundred dollars, which fee
                    held out the lure of one certificate of stock in a non-dividend paying
                    corporation; regular membership fees from five dollars to three per year; and
                    the use of the library bestowed on all members of a family not in
                    "independent businesses." Early in its history it was open
                    from ten in the morning to noon and from seven to ten at night on two days per
                    week, though the reading-room was open daily except Sun- <list type="footnotes">

            <p>But that which sheds real lustre on the period is the means whereby the
                    association was financed, for until 1882 it was without invested funds,
                    dependent wholly on membership fees and the wits of its officers. A strawberry
                    festival is recorded as having netted May 19,1877, $23.83; October 2,
                    1871, an art gallery exhibition and promenade social was determined upon, for
                    which the Philharmonic Society and Mannerchor were to be solicited for music;
                    June 3, 1873, a committee being created to sponsor an ice-cream festival;
                    November 3, 1873, the public was invited to meet the board in order to arrange a
                    masquerade ball, which left the members rejoicing with $176 to add to
                    their treasury. But these are the conventional small-town fÃªtes of
                    the period. Where the association conferred a real benefit upon the community
                    was in the distinguished lecturers which the board brought to the town in its
                    annual lecture courses covering a period of twenty-five years. The list contains
                    such speakers as Emerson, William Lloyd Garrison, Charles Sumner, Wendell
                    Phillips, Bayard Taylor, Benjamin Taylor, Horace Greeley, P. V. Nasby, Susan B.
                    Anthony, George Thompson, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Anna E. Dickinson, Clara
                    Barton, and Mrs. Scott Siddons. The public could scarcely have complained of
                    exploitation even in a good cause when course tickets of four lectures were
                    offered at one dollar, single admissions thirty-five cents. Each of these years
                    during this interval brought donations of books, which meant a steady, if not
                    rapid, growth in the size of the <list type="footnotes">

                    two and three thousand volumes. Perhaps the fact that the rooms were crowded
                    every night with readers explains the strange "calumny" which
                    an early writer felt called open to repudiate that "we are a political
                    institution."</p>
            <p>The efforts to have the library in a permanent home constitute a dramatic chapter
                    in its history from 1874 to 1876. First came the General Orr proposal. He
                    offered to purchase from the Presbyterians their old building and grounds,
                    together with the half-lot adjacent, if it could be purchased for not more than
                    four thousand dollars, and to present it to the association on condition that
                    the structure be preserved to promote the objects of the association, that that
                    organization add a brick addition, and that six thousand dollars or more be
                    raised by the citizens to aid in improving the grounds and in increasing the
                    library and the specimens. Active measures were taken to raise the requisite sum
                    by volunteer subscriptions, no small feat to accomplish in a town of small
                    property-owners between February 21 and May 12. Just at this juncture an
                    unfortunate disagreement between the donor and the board in regard to the
                    arrangement and the repair of the building and in regard to the manner in which
                    the fund should be expended led to a rupture and the reconveying of the property
                    to General Orr.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> But most of the subscribers were agreeable
                    to allowing the money to form a fund for the purchase of a suitable site when
                    opportunity presented.</p>
            <p>Somewhat more than a year later came the second proposal, which seemed to promise
                    a permanent abiding-place. In August, 1875, a prominent banker and
                    property-owner of the city offered to sell the association a corner section for
                    two thousand dollars with a donation of several hundred dollars in money and
                    fifty thousand bricks for the building. But this proposal also came to
                    shipwreck, as the board by November of that year had reached the wise conclusion
                    of rejecting the <list type="footnotes">

                            the library, which it survived only by some fortunate bequests.</item>

                    refunded to the association.</p>
            <p>Success came at last through independent measures. May 1, 1876, the library board
                    bought of the heirs of N. T. Place a lot centrally located for twelve hundred
                    dollars, the heirs making a small donation to the association. By 1876 a simple
                    but suitable two-story brick structure had been erected but with the almost
                    inevitable concomitant of a debt of a thousand dollars fastened upon it.</p>
            <p>The years from 1877 to 1897 mark another well-defined period during which the
                    library lived in its own quarters as a private institution. With a debt of
                    twelve hundred dollars on its hands the association WM eager to pass on its
                    responsibilities. Early in 1878 a new and especially-elected board leased the
                    library property to the Young Men's Association, a business
                    corporation, at a nominal rental of one dollar, the debt to be assumed by the
                    latter association. But two years later the Library association found itself
                    once more saddled with its old burden, as the Young Men's association
                    canceled the lease. Accordingly, a group of a dozen of the leading citizens came
                    to the rescue with a loan of a hundred dollars each for five years without
                    interest.</p>
            <p>By August, 1880, the board found itself without funds for current expenses and
                    obliged to dismiss the librarian, but reached a strange solution by turning the
                    library over to J. B. Holmes, who in return for the membership fees was to.
                    conduct the library, ostensibly for the benefit of the members, but practically
                    for the benefit of the students of his business college. Oddly enough, the
                    arrangement proved mutually satisfactory and was renewed yearly until his death,
                    late in 1888, whereupon a similar arrangement was entered into with his widow
                    and successively with several other people until 1897.</p>

                    death of the latter in 1882 that it became available. After the debts of the
                    association were paid, it was possible to set aside $4,300 as a
                    permanent fund, the interest of which was devoted to the purchase of books.
                    Within about a decade the association received a second bequest from the estate
                    of Mrs. Nancy Treat, one thousand dollars in cash and a lot adjacent to the
                    library valued at $4,000.</p>
            <p>But now appeared a desire to make the library a benefaction to the whole
                    communityâ€”a public library. It was felt that the school children and
                    the very element which most needed a library were deprived of its benefits,
                    whereas it was the earnest desire of the members to make the books serve their
                    widest field of usefulness.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> Among the several state laws
                    under which the change could be effected, it was held wise to select the law of
                    1881, which authorized the school board in cities of ten thousand inhabitants to
                    establish a free public library in connection with the common schools and to
                    levy a tax of one-third of a mill on each dollar of taxable property.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> After several meetings of the association, to one of
                    which prominent citizens were invited, and after long negotiations with the
                    school board, it was voted on June 3, 1896, to convey all the property of the
                    association to the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">La Porte</settlement>
                    </placeName> after the building should have been remodeled and enlarged with the
                    funds lying unused in the treasury of the association. A reading-room and
                    children's room, added as wings to each side of the original building,
                    transformed it into a more attractive as well as more commodious structure.</p>
            <p>The board of education assumed control on April 23, 1897, with a small debt for
                    unfinished work, which the city had agreed to assume provided that no tax were

                    funds for books or rebinding. By the middle of the year 1899, the board was
                    forced to dispense with the assistant librarian for six months and to close the
                    library mornings. And during this period it was kept open only through the

                    allowed to add $10,000, and after tedious delays, due to the war and
                    consequent building conditions, the new structure was erected, scarcely half a
                    square from the old, and opened on November 6, 1920.</p>
            <p>But interesting as is the library itself, it is its museum which probably
                    entitles the library to a unique place among small town libraries in the central
                    west. It was started, as has already been suggested, in 1868, only a few years
                    after the library movement was launched, with a cabinet and collection of
                    minerals, ores, fossils, and shells under the inspiration of Dr. Higday, one of
                    the directors, who was particularly interested in developing this department. At
                    one time he fathered an excursion to the Indian mounds near the Kankakee river,
                    where he unearthed for the association a large number of flint and copper
                    implements, arrow-heads, pottery, and bones.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
                    Unfortunately, Dr. Higday's intention to label and catalog these early
                    specimens was not carried out because of his death in 1876, and hence the value
                    of the collection has been to a certain extent lost. From one reason or another,
                    various objects have found a depository in the library until it now houses a
                    heterogeneous collection of stuffed birds and animals,<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

                    makes the collection of real worth to <placeName>

                    and technical books. The cost spread over a whole county is nominal.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>

            <p>Many of the first families to settle in the northern portion of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain county</region>
                    </placeName>, particularly in Attica and vicinity, came from Waynesville, Warren
                    counuty, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Among those emigrants who came to Attica about 1839 was Dr. John
                    Evans. He had graduated at a medical college in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, and had practiced less than a year at
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Ottawa</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>. He was a brother
                    of Mrs Wilson Claypool, who lived about three miles south of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Attica</region>
                    </placeName>, near Shawnee creek on Shawnee prairie, and he had a very extensive
                    colony of friends and acquaintances. He soon built up a lucrative practice in
                    his profession. About 1840 he built a very good residence on Perry street, about
                    two blocks from the business district, and this building remained until 1879. In
                    1841 he built an office in which to conduct his practice. This building still
                    stands on Main street and is occupied as a grocery store. When Dr. Evans
                    practiced in Attica there was no railroad or water way other than the
                        <geogName>Wabash river</geogName> and many of the farmers in this locality
                    made occasional trips to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> with the products of the farm, returning with manufactuured goods,
                    preferring this to the more arduous trips to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> by flatboat. Some of the goods were hauled to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> by ox teams and some by horses. There were grist mills, saw mills,
                    packing houses and distilleries along the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName> in
                    every direction from Attica and the products of the packing houses, flouring
                    mills and distilleries of this locality were quite often hauled overland to the
                    city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and exchanged for merchandise. On one of these trips Dr. John Evans
                    joined some of his friends and was favorably impressed at once with the
                    possibility of the growing city on the lake. He pictured its future so vividly
                    and told his associates of the great future in store for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and, though they listened indulgently to his predictions, they
                    considered him much of a dreamer; but he was more than a <pb n="227" id="VAA4025-019-3-019"/> dreamer. He was a dreamer who tried to make his
                    dreams come true. One day, when the spirit of prophecy was upon him he declared
                    to a group of his fellow townsmen that before he died he intended to build a
                    city, to found a college, to be governor of one of the states of the union and
                    to go to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senate, to amass a fortune and make himself famous. His friends had
                    heard him prophesy so often that they half way believed some of his prophecies
                    and this one impressed them so much that it WM so often repeated that it became
                    a part of the local folk lore. In about 1840 Dr. Evans and his wife became very
                    deeply interested in Dorothy Dix and her gospel of humane and scientific care
                    for the insane and imbued with the idea that the insane should be cared for at
                    the expense of the state. In the fall of 1841 William G. Bales, then the sheriff
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vermillion county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, placed his mute son in the Ohio institution. When he took
                    his son there he became very much interested in the enterprise of educating the
                    deaf and dumb and the next year he was elected to represent his county in the
                    legislature. Dr. C. V. Jones of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Covington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, was the family physician of William C. Bales. Dr. Jones
                    WM well acquainted with Dr. John Evans and his wife and their interest in the
                    state providing asylums for the blind, mute and insane. Through Dr. Jones Mr.
                    Bales and Dr. Evans became acquainted. In 1842 James McLean, a mute, commenced a
                    school in Parke county. This school was continued for more than a year, but at
                    no time contained more than six pupils. William Crumpton of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Attica</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, then one of the leading merchants, was a patron of the
                    McLean school, and Mr. Crumpton and Dr. Isaac Fisher of Attica and Dr. John
                    Evans, Edward A. Hannegan of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Covington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Dr. Caleb V. Jones, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Covington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and their wives made an organization to commence a united effort
                    to carry out in the state of Indiana through its legislature the principles of
                    Dorothy Dix, "that the state should take care of the mute, the blind
                    and the insane." On January 5, 1842, Edward A. Rannegan representing <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain county</region>
                    </placeName> in the lower house of the legislature presented to the Indiana

                        <region type="county">Attica</region>

                    of an asylum for the <pb n="228" id="VAA4025-019-3-020"/> insane. Jacob P. Dunn
                    says of Dr Evans in connection with his efforts to establish an asylum for the
                    insane: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Later developments show that the moving spirit was Dr. Evans, who was one

                            beneficences, half way across the continent. He was born near

                            </placeName>. His great-grandfather was a manufacturer of tools in <placeName>

                            </placeName> and this handicraft came down in the family, his uncle,
                            Owen Evans, being the inventor of the screwing auger. His grandfather
                            moved to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                            </placeName> but soon left there because of his objection to slavery and
                            settled in the wilds of Ohio where he farmed and manufactured augers,
                            until he retired with a fortune. His son David, Dr. John's
                            father, was a farmer and John grew up on the farm with usual country
                            school advantages, but when grown up he went to <placeName>

                            </placeName> and took a course in the Clermont academy. He then began
                            the study of medicine, and in 1839 he married Hannah Canby, a cousin of
                            Gen. E. R. S. Canby, and they immediately located at <placeName>

                            </placeName>, where he soon acquired some reputation as a physician and
                            financier. The memorial of 1842 was referred to the committee on
                            education of which Dr. James Richey of <placeName>

                            </placeName>, himself a prominent physician, was chairman. On January
                            23, 1842, Dr. Evans made an extended report setting forth the importance
                            of the matter and quoting a report of the Ohio asylum from which he
                            says, "We find that there have been applications made for the
                            admission of thirteen insane persons from this state into the Ohio
                            Insane asylum. These applicants have been refused for want of room. What
                            burning shame should crimson the cheek of every Indianian on being
                            informed of the foregoing fact in view of the facts and the great
                            necessity of speedy action upon this important subject. The committee
                            recommended the adoption of a resolution instructing the governor to
                            correspond with the superintendents of asylums in other states and
                            secure plans for buildings and other information, which plans and

            <p>This resolution promptly passed both houses, and was approved by the governor on
                    January 31,1842. The governor apparently did nothing, at least nothing of
                    importance, and did not mention the subject in his next message, but on December
                    27,1842, a second memorial from Dr. John Evans and Dr. Isaac Fisher, both of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Attica</region>
                    </placeName>, was presented suggesting the propriety of appropriating the
                    Indiana share of the proceeds of the public lands to the erection of a lunatic
                    asylum. This <pb n="229" id="VAA4025-019-3-021"/> was referred to the committee
                    on finance which on January 2, 1843, reported its intense sympathy with the
                    project, but with this most unhappy condition of so many of our fellow citizens
                    before us, it is with much regret that your committee, owing to the extremely
                    embarrassed condition of the finances of the state recommend a postponement of
                    the further consideration of the subject. This was concurred in and the
                    committee discharged, but the legislature showed its sentiment by a rather sharp
                    resolution of February 13, 1843, declaring that delay in the matter was criminal
                    and making it the duty of the governor to correspond and report as before
                    directed, whereupon it shall be the duty of the legislature to adopt proper
                    measures for the immediate erection of a lunatic asylum in the state of Indiana.</p>

                    </placeName> for the state senate, and he was elected in the fall election of
                    1843 as a Democrat. This was a victory for the <placeName>

                    </placeName> doctors and their friends as it gave them a friend in the upper
                    house of the state legislature in whom they had absolute confidence, and upon
                    whose support they could depend. The representatives in the lower house from

                    and Edward A. Hannegan and William C. Bales, were all pledged to the support of
                    a bill to establish an asylum for the insane. Before the election of Dr. Jones
                    there had been no active member in the upper house of the legislature to defend
                    the bill, and when the legislature convened in 1843 the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain county</region>
                    </placeName> advocates of the principles of Dorothy Dix for the care of the
                    insane felt that they were now able to put up a determined fight and they
                    attended the legislature in a body. A more determined body of politicians, with
                    deeper convictions for a principle which they believed to be just and right
                    never appeared before a law making body than was this representation from <placeName>

                    </placeName>. They were in direct correspondence with Dorothy Dix and in

            <p>In his message of December 5, 1843, Governor James Bigger referred to this
                    resolution and said this duty had been attended to and the documents and

                    Esq., who is preparing plans and specifications in relation to an asylum which
                    will be ready to be laid before the legislature in the course of a few days.

                    without waiting on Smith's report on December 13, a communication from
                    James Matthews was presented in the senate and referred to the committee on
                    education. On December 19 Senator George W. Carr, of Lawrence, reported from
                    this committee deep sympathy and appreciation of the importance of the measure
                    but owing to the great debt of the state and the heavy taxes, under the
                    circumstances it would be inexpedient to legislate upon that subject at the
                    present. But Drs. Matthews and Jones were in the senate and determined the bill
                    should go through. On motion of Senator Buell the communication of Dr. Matthew
                    was recommitted to the committee on education with instructions to report the
                    probable expense of an asylum, the time it would take to complete it and all
                    other matters thereto appertaining. This was followed by an invitation to Dr.
                    Evans to address the legislature on the subject, also by a second communuication
                    from Dr. Matthews, which with the plans of Mr. Smith was also referred to the
                    same committee. The upper and lower house of the legislature met in joint
                    session to listen to an address of a private citizen on this important subject.
                    Seldom, if ever, has such respect and recognition been paid to a private citizen
                    by any law making body. Dr. Evans made an able presentation of the entire
                    subject before the legislature and a large audience of citizens. It was printed
                    in full in the Sentinel, December 29-30. The majority of the committee on
                    education was convinced and on January 12, 1844, Dr. Richey reported for the
                    committee urging immediate action and recommending a tax of one cent on the
                    hundred dollars. The report was adopted and the tax levied. At the beginning of
                    the next session Dr. John Evans was promptly on hand, supported by his friends
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain county</region>
                    </placeName>, with another memorial. There was an <pb n="231" id="VAA4025-019-3-023"/> improvement in the situation. He still had his
                    friends, Dr. Jones in the senate and Gov. James Whitcomb in the
                    governor's office. He warmly espoused the charitable work,
                    notwithstanding his anxiety to get out of the financial tangle. In his opening
                    message he said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>While on this subject I desire earnestly to call your attention to the
                            importance of providing an institution for the education of the blind
                            and for the construction of the lunatic asylum. Modern philanthropy has
                            happily devised the means of educating those who were deprived of sight
                            and we should regard it as a secred debt which we owe to these
                            unfortunates to afford them the benefits of this benevolent discovery.
                            It is now ascertained that insanity, the most terrible disease that
                            afflicts our race, will in a majority of cases readily yield to medicine
                            and kind treatment. If these means are resorted to in time it's
                            wretched subjects would thus be restored to the kindly charities of the
                            domestic circles, to the benefit of society, and to their various
                            relations, obligations and advantages as members of the state. Surely
                            these unfortunate classes are entitled to our warmest sympathy and
                            relief to the extent of our ability is called for by sound economy, by
                            enlightened policy, by the gratitude that we owe to a merciful
                            providence for our own exemption from these evils and by the obligation

                    the state senate but regardless of differences in politics they were all
                    supporting James Whitcomb for governor. In this campaign there was a great
                    display of oratory. Governor Bigger was running for reelection. He was a
                    graduate of <placeName>

                    </placeName>) University, a distinguished legislator and judge, and an eloquent
                    stump speaker. The Democrats nominated James Whitcomb, formerly a sup porter of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>. This was an agricultural community and the Democrats showed by the
                    logic of statistics that workmen in the factories were receiving five hundred
                    dollars per year while farm hands were receiving only two hundred thirteen
                    dollars per year. There were at least twenty farm hands in this locality to one
                    factory man. They showed that the farm products were not protected, but when
                    such products were manu- <pb n="232" id="VAA4025-019-3-024"/> factured into
                    goods, they were highly protected; that the farmers' wheat and corn
                    were free, but the plow and other farm implements that they bought were
                    protected. The best market for Indiana farmers was among the planters of the
                    South; these same planters were being ruined by the high tariff. It was the
                    first time that the protective policy had been challenged in Indiana and it
                    created considerable alarm in the Whig camp. Edward A. Hannegan was a candidate
                    for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senate. Andrew Kennedy, who was then in congress from the Muncey
                    district, was raised in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Attica</region>
                    </placeName>, his father, brothers and sisters lived here and he had married the
                    daughter of Phillip Weaver. There was a very large family of the Weavers here.
                    Both of these families had formerly been Whigs but they were Friends and a part
                    of the clientele of Dr. Evans. That element of the Whig party from this county
                    which was supporting James Whitcomb for governor and Caleb V. Jones for the
                    state senate gathered about Dr. John Evans as their political leader. As a
                    result of this campaign Andrew Kennedy was returned to congress, James Whitcomb
                    was elected governor, Caleb V. Jones was elected to the state senate from this
                    district and the large majority for the Democratic ticket, at that election, in
                    this part of the state, was credited to the influence of Dr. Evans. When he
                    appeared before the legislature in 1843 to continue his efforts for the
                    establishment of an asylum for the insane and schools for the mutes and the
                    blind at the expense of the state, he was not only acquainted with the state
                    officers in charge, but they were all deeply indebted to him. The handicap he
                    had encountered in his previous efforts was now gone. During the session of the
                    legislature of the years of 1843 and 1844 Dr., Evans and his wife spent the
                    winter in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Upon his return to Attica in the spring he presented his petition
                    to the Masonic lodge and was made a Mason by Attica lodge number eighteen, June
                    28, 1844, and was demitted June 17, 1845. When Dr. Evans was a young man in Ohio
                    one of his friends and associates was Henry Benson. Henry Benson was related to
                    the Campbells, who lived in the Bethel neighborhood. In 1838 Henry Benson was
                    visiting his relatives here and there was a great revival meeting at the
                    Methodist church at Bethel. He was only a boy, but he became very much inter-

                    </placeName>. The Campbells in Bethel neighborhood also came from Waynesville, <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Henry Benson afterward graduated from DePauw University. In 1840
                    and 1841 Henry Benson visited his friends and acquaintances in the neighborhood
                    of Attica and among them was Dr. Evans and his wife. He preached at Attica and
                    Bethel, and through his influence Dr. Evans and wife united with the Methodist
                    church in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Attica</region>
                    </placeName>. Both Henry Benson and Edward A. Hannegan were personal friends of
                    Bishop Matthew Simpson, and through them Dr. Evans, after he had united with the
                    Methodist church at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Attica</region>

            <p>In the year of this campaign of 1843 William Willard, a mute from the east,
                    learning of the interest in Indiana in public maintenance of charitable
                    institutions, visited this state and established a school for his fellow
                    defectives. Now with Dr. Evans well established in the political circles of the
                    state, Willard's work was looked upon with favor, and in 1844 the state
                    opened the school with Mr. Willard in charge. Such men as Henry Ward Beecher,
                    Bishop Matthew Simpson and Dr. Evans took an active interest in the work. A site
                    for the school consisting of one hundred thirty acres near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was purchased in 1846. In 1850 a spacious building was erected. The

                    with the Methodist church. There was a great religious awakening, particularly
                    among the Quakers and the Methodists in this locality, from 1840 to 1844, which
                    probably extended over large portions of the state. Logan Esarey says: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            visited the capitol to hear their leader. It was determined to conduct a
                            campaign along the old lines. Van Buren was the only Democratic
                            candidate above the horizon at that time. Had he been the candidate in
                            1844, the plan of the Whigs might have been carried to success, but, as
                            it turned out, their course was fatal. Such men as Robert Dale Owen,
                            Joseph A. Wright, Andrew Kennedy, James Whitcomb and John W. Davis
                            preached a new democracy, and were more than a match for the old Whigs.
                            They pleaded for human rights, individual liberty, private initiative;

            <p>Senator William Allen came from Ohio to canvass for the Democrats and here is a

                    the campaign of 1843-44: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Democracy is a sentiment not to be appalled, corrupted or compromised; it
                            knows no baseness, cowers at no danger, oppresses no weakness. Fearless,
                            generous, humane, it rebukes the arrogant, cherishes honor and
                            sympathizes with the humble; it asks nothing it will not concede, it

            <p>With the charitable, religious and reform sentiment espoused by the Democrats and

                    for Dr. Evans to secure the support of his friends and acquaintances of the
                    Democratic party in these four counties. In addition to this was the candidacy

            <p>This emphasis on religion, giving Governor Whitcomb credit for the utmost
                    sincerity, suggests the possibility of an influence, perhaps unconscious, of
                    church politics. As has been mentioned, Governor Bigger was defeated for
                    reelection largely through the influence of the Methodists. Dr. Evans had become
                    an intimate friend of Bishop Simpson and under his eloquent preaching had become
                    converted and joined the Methodist church, of which he was thereafter one of the
                    most zealous and useful lay members. He was an able politician of the better
                    class and it is hardly imaginable that he did not make himself felt in that
                    campaign. At any rate, he was on the best of terms with Governor Whitcomb. His
                    memorial and the part of the governor's message quoted were referred to
                    the senate committee on education and December 28, 1844, Dr. Ritchy reported for
                    the committee in favor of creating a commission to purchase a site and take
                    charge of the erection of a buiding. An act for that purpose was approved
                    January 13, 1845, making Dr. Evans, Dr. Livington Dunlap and James Blake
                    commissioners. They selected and purchased the Bolton farm west of White river,
                    which had been made historic by its "Mount <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> Tavern" presided over by Sarah T. Bolton. They wanted more
                    light before adopting plans, but had no "junketing"
                    appropriation. Dr. Evans volunteered to visit existing institutions at his own
                    expense and trust to the legislature to reimburse him. He went to all of the
                    principal institutions of the country, consulted experts and reformers,
                    including Miss Dix, and on June 22, 1845, reported the results to the
                    commission, with admirable detail not only as to the general plan of a building
                    but also as to the practical features of water supply, heating, drainage,
                    ventilation and the like. This was submitted to the legislature with the
                    commission's report. They had discarded the Smith plans, and had new
                    ones made by John R. Elder, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, utilizing the information collected by Evans. By act of February
                    19,1846, they were directed to proceed with the work; additional appropriations
                    were made; and they were authorized to sell Hospital Square No. 22 and use the
                    proceeds. The building <pb n="236" id="VAA4025-019-3-028"/> was begun promptly
                    and pushed as fast as the proceeds of the tax would allow. Two wards were opened
                    for patients in December, 1848, accommodating forty applicants and the reminder
                    of the south wing was completed in the sumer of 1849. The entire building, when
                    finished in 1850, had cost $75,000.</p>
            <p>Dr. Evans continued with the institution until the summer of 1848. After the
                    passage of the act of 1846 the commission felt the need of a superintendent of
                    construction and decided that Evans was the one man for the place. He resigned
                    from the commission to accept it and Dr. J. S. Bobbs was appointed in his place.
                    Evans had removed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he had an extensive practice, in addition to his work on the
                    building; but in 1845 he had been appointed a lecturer at Rush Medical college
                    at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and he foresaw the possibilities of that city, which he had first
                    visited with some farmer friends who tried hauling produce overland to that
                    point from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Attica</region>
                    </placeName>, instead of flat-boating to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He removed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1848 and at once became a leading spirit there, his first move
                    being the issue of a pamphlet combating accepted ideas on cholera and advocating
                    strict quarantine as a preventive. He edited for a number of years the
                    Northwestern Medical and Surgical Journal and founded the Illinois General
                    Hospital of the Lakes, later Mercy Hospital. He was instrumental in establishing
                    the Methodist Book Concern and the Northwestern Christian Advocate. He was one
                    of the promoters of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> &amp; <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Railroad, secured its valuable right of way into <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and was for years its resi-ent managing director.</p>
            <p>There is an old neglected cemetery in the southern part of the city of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Attica</region>
                    </placeName>. This for many years was the cemetery in which all of the first
                    settlers of this locality buried their dead, and here are many silent messages
                    of many forgotten incidents of interest. Seldom are there any visitors to this
                    neglected graveyard and in the summer and fall it is a tangle of briar, bush and
                    vine. Near the north side is a dilapidated iron fence enclosing a tangle of
                    weeds and briars. The iron fence is set in a stone foundation. Everything about
                    this little plot of burial ground shows that once there had been the touch of
                        <pb n="237" id="VAA4025-019-3-029"/> fond memories and sweet recollections;
                    that it was designed and erected by loving hands. In this tangle of briars and
                    weeds and vines rises an imposing shaft, the largest that was ever erected in
                    the cemetery, and three small marble stones. The following inscription is
                    chiseled on the marble shaft, "Hannah R., wife of Dr. John Evans, born
                    at <placeName>
                  <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>, <country reg="ohu">Ohio</country>
               </placeName>, June 9,1813; died at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>, October 9, 1850." The three
                    sons buried beside the larger grave died in Attica and the body of Mrs. Evans
                    was brought overland in a wagon pulled by two horses from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Attica for burial.</p>
            <p>In 1853 Dr. John Evans became the chief promoter of Northwestern University, and
                    selected its site, which was named <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evanston</settlement>
                    </placeName> in his honor. By reserving a quarter of each block for endowment
                    and making investments for it in the heart of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> he established its splendid financial foundation. He also endowed
                    chairs to the extent of $100,000 and was president of the board of
                    trustees for forty-two years. He also got into politics as a city councilman in
                    1852-3 and did good work for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> schools by securing the appointment of a superintendent of schools
                    and the establishment of the first high school. He was an original Republican
                    and ran for congress in 1855, but was defeated because he would not indorse the
                    Knownothing doctrine. He had become a personal friend of Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, while at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Attica</region>
                    </placeName>, and as a delegate to the convention of 1860 helped nominate him
                    for President.</p>
            <p>The six years that Dr. Evans lived in Attica had more to do with directing and
                    determining his future than any other period of his life. Here he became
                    acquainted with Henry Benson, afterwards editor of the Pacific <hi rend="i">Advocate</hi>, missionary to the Indians in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>, and one of the most eloquent speakers and influential men in the
                    Methodist church on the Pacific coast; Bishop Matthew Simpson and Solon Turman,
                    who was state senator from this district in 1850 and afterwards judge of the
                    supreme court of the state of Indiana; Geneal Tilghman A. Howard of <placeName>

                    A. Hannegan, afterwards <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senator; Dorothy Dix; Judge David Davis of Illinois and Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>. As long as he lived in Indiana and Illinois he never lost interest
                    in Attica and every fall when the apples were ripe and the wild grapes could be
                    gathered and the bitter sweet, the aster and the golden rod, and other fall
                    flowers were in bloom and fruits were ripe, Dr. Evans would come to Attica to
                    spend a few days with his friends. He would go to the woods and kill some wild
                    game, and fish along Pine Creek and Shawnee, and then go back for another year
                    of arduous work. He looked forward with great delight to the yearly visit with
                    his friends and relatives and with equal interest they awaited his coming. He
                    never lost interest in his friends and acquaintances here and they never lost
                    interest in him. In 1860 he espoused the cause of Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a candidate for President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> on the Republican ticket. He appealed to his friends in Indiana and
                    with the same trust and devotion that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain county</region>
                    </placeName> had shown to him and his interests in the campaign of 1843 they
                    answered again for the campaign of 1860. During the time that Douglas and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> were having their joint debates over the state of Illinois Dr.
                    Evans paid one of his annual visits to Attica and he and his Republican friends
                    here attended one of these joint debates. Among those who went with him on this
                    occasion was Ed. Town, George Worthington, Harry Brant, Luke Whicker and Dr.
                    Alexander Whitehall. Dr. Evans and Dr. Whitehall were credited the honor of
                    sitting on the speaker's stand as a guest of Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> to listen to the joint debate between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Douglas. His friends here have always claimed that it was Dr.
                    Evans who financed <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s campaign for the nomination on the Republican ticket for
                    President and assured him he need not be embarrassed in any way in that campaign
                    or apply to anyone else for financial help; that he had never spent money with a
                    freer hand or in a cause in which he was more deeply interested than the money
                    that he would spend for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s nomination. He was a delegate from his congressional
                    district to the Republican national convention in 1860. He was thoroughly <pb n="239" id="VAA4025-019-3-031"/> acquainted with the politics of Indiana,
                    with the politics of Illinois and the politics of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and it was largely through his influence and acquaintance assisted
                    by Henry S. Lane of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Caleb B. Smith of the Fourth congressional district that every
                    delegate at that convention from the state of Indiana voted first, last and all
                    the time for the nomination of Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Indiana was the only state in the union that cast every vote in
                    that memorable convention from first to last for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was said that he contributed very liberally toward the campaign
                    fund for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s election. His contemporaries of 1840 to '48
                    showed some recognition of his relentless energy and conceded that largely due
                    to his efforts that the Democrats won in 1843. In 1846 the insane hospital
                    commissioners, James Blake, Drs. Dunlap and Bobbs, testified that he was the
                    first to press the duty of making provisions for the insane upon the attention
                    of the legislature in the state of Indiana. In 1847 Dorothy Dix visited Indiana
                    and inspected jails and poor houses in half the counties of the state. She had
                    by that time carried her crusade into many of the states and everywhere found
                    them much the same. In Indiana she found the conditions better than the average.
                    And in that year she wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            measure of his labors or ability requisite for devising and carrying out
                            such plans as are comprised in the Indiana state hospital for the

                    governor. In 1865 Colorado elected him <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and refused to connect with that city, he secured the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Denver</settlement>
                    </placeName> Pacific land grant from congress and built the road from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Denver</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Cheyenne, 106 miles. Next he built the South Park railroad, and
                    then started the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Denver</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
               </placeName> and Gulf to give the
                    shortest possible line to the seaboard. In 1870, on the competion of the line to
                    Cheyenne, a state celebration was held at Greeley and Mount Evans was named in
                    his honorâ€”the name being formally confirmed by the legislature of
                    Colorado in 1895, on his eighty-first birthday. Such was the monument prepared
                    for him when he died at <placeName>

            <p>In the cause of humanity the battle of his life was fought, a part of the time a
                    fierce and stormy conflict. He was one of the prophets of his age. Born in the
                    gray twilight of the nineteenth century, his prophetic eye pierced through the
                    intervening years to and beyond the golden twilight of the. twentieth, and when
                    he viewed man's progress and beheld his glorious destiny this matchless
                    seer rang out the old and rang in the new. He stood by the side of the great
                    emancipator and upheld his arms when he struck the shackles from four millions
                    of human beings and gathered the chains that bound their limbs in his deft hands
                    and stepped from the highest round in the ladder that reached the pinnacle of
                    fame, into the portals of heaven, and laid those chains at the feet of his
                    creator, a fitting gift to a just God. He had helped relieve pain and furnished
                    aid to the weak, the mute, the blind, and the insane. In the cause of mankind,
                    the relief of the suffering, in the education of the youth, in provisions for
                    the aged, the battle of his life was fought. In a distant land the night of
                    death closed over his eventful life, gentle and loving friends administered to
                    him. If to love your fellow men more than yourself is good, then Dr. Evans was
                    good; if to be in advance of your time, to be a pioneer in the direction of
                    right is greatness then Dr. Evans was great; if to avow your principles and
                    discharge your duty in the presence of danger and death is heroic, then Dr.
                    Evans was a hero.</p>

            <p>Only twice under the old constitution did the people of Indiana vote for the
                    President of the nation and the governor of the state in the same year. In the
                    presidential year of 1816 they elected a governor but the legislature chose the
                    presidential electors. The quadrennial presidential elections and the triennial
                    governorship elections threw the two together again in 1828 and also in 1840.
                    Naturally the national question became a greater factor in these years than in
                    any other in the election of the governor but even then its influence was not
                    nearly so great as in more recent times owing largely to the fact that the two
                    elections did not occur on the same date. The governorship election was held in
                    August and the presidential in November. In other years the national question
                    was scarcely felt at all in the governorship election.</p>
            <p>Governor Jennings had been elected for a second term; Governor Hendricks had been
                    sent to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> senate, and it was generally expected that Governor Ray would be a
                    candidate again in 1828. He announced himself as a candidate in April but made
                    no mention of party or of his position in national politics.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    </placeName> forces would not be satisfied with a neutral candidate. Even
                    earlier than this the Jacksonian press had informally brought forward Dr. Israel
                    T. Canby of <placeName>

                    gdvernor.2 His candidacy had, however, not been seriously urged and when Ray
                    announced it was rumored that Ray's correspondence with <placeName>

                        <p>Whereas it has been represented that Major Henry S. Handy has recently
                            received a communication from Governor Ray expressive of his sentiments
                            on the presidential election favorable to the election of Andrew <placeName>

                            (Democrats) opposed to the reelection of Mr. Adams as "A
                            Violent atrocious faction which every good man ought to unite in
                            suppressing."</p>
                    </quote> This was followed by a resolution calling upon Major Handy to produce
                    Ray's letter to him. Major Handy explained that a report had reached
                    the central committee that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s letter to Ray had completely converted Ray to the cause
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The committee believing this, had appointed a committee to wait
                    upon the governor and find out the truth of the matter, and also whether he
                    would allow his name to be placed upon the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> ticket as a candidate for governor. Major Handy being the chairman
                    of that committee had written to Governor Ray and the letter in question had
                    been addressed to Handy. Ray writing under date of May 15, 1828, said: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            not become a partisan but shall have no objection to receiving the
                            united support of the Jacksonians. I shall not undo what they see fit to
                            do in state elections, and will admit the election to be a test of
                            strength. But must be permitted for the good of the cause to object to a

                            to give his opinions on the question of the candidates of the high
                            office of national executive, or to which, Mr. Adams or Mr. Jackson, he
                            would give his personal support; assigning as his reason that he wished
                            to avoid giving encouragement to either of the parties which now oppose
                            each other on that subject, by lending them his name to aid in keeping

                            aloof from both and employ his influence to assuage the storm; that
                            measures and not men constituted his rallying point, and that whoever
                            might be called to administer the government he was prepared to go with
                            and support them so far as they pursued a correct policy, or in other
                            words support of the American system.</p>

            <p>The editor of the <hi rend="i">Repository</hi> did not agree with this attitude
                    and sought the governor after the speech and put a series of questions to him
                    from the Adams point of view. Ray in his answers declared: 1st. That the present
                    administration was constitutionally established; 2nd. He did hot believe the
                    charges of bargain sale and corruption prepared against Adams and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>; 3rd. The opposition to the administration is an outrageous and
                    violent faction; 4th. It is the duty of every good man from the governor of the
                    state downward to oppose such a faction.</p>
            <p>Ray was a man who was not able to seize the "tide at its flood"
                    or rather he belonged to the type of politicians who, "having eyes see
                    not." Mere chance had made it possible for him to be governor. He had
                    never been forced to risk a stand on an issue and he did not care to do so now.
                    Moreover he could not see that the personality of political personages was being
                    merged into party spirit. This induced him to stand alone and play a game of
                    duplicity in bidding for the votes of both factions. In doing so he lost the
                    support of partisans on both sides. The report of Major Handy to the convention
                    determined the action of the Jacksonians, and one week later, July 5, 1828,
                    Israel T. Canby announced himself as a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>-ian candidate for governor. In his formal announcement Canby
                    declared: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>The administration forces had already brought out Harbin H. Moore of Corydon as

            <p>In speaking of the immediate charges he said he was opposed at the last election
                    by certain lawyers and political men, generally Adams men, and that these men
                    declared opposition to him as soon as he was sworn into office. These men were
                    again at the head of the administration party of the state, and last winter they
                    had deliberately planned to ruin him. These administration men, at the time the
                    two conventions met in January, had conferred with the Jacksonians and requested
                    them to draw the line and bring out a candidate for governor, and then assured
                    them that they would do the same thing and in that way they could have beat him
                    on mutual ground. If they found they could not leave him out in that way that
                    they would join with the Jacksonians and defeat him in that manner and if he
                    became the friend of Adams they would bring out another candidate. He met the

            <p>Since the candidate depended upon personal contact with the voters to make his

                    with him and a knowledge of his qualifications and also on account of his local
                    situation which was thought to be particularly favorable for such an
                    appointment. While the bill was pending in the house of representatives the
                    governor was frequently in the lobby, electioneering against the insertion of
                    Mr. Noble's name, declaring if it should be continued he would not sign
                    it. The house disregarding these threats, passed the bill with Mr.
                    Noble's name as commissioner. After it was reported to the senate with
                    its amendment, the governor continued to exert his influence with the senators
                    to have Mr. Noble's name expunged, using coarse epithets in reference
                    to him and declaring, as he had before done, that he would not approve the law
                    if the name were retained. The bill, however, passed both houses and was sent to
                    the governor for his signature. After keeping the bill for two or three days he
                    signed it and wrote at the bottom of the same page: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            law if at all without my signature. But finding that the legislature is
                            ready to adjourn without permitting it to remain in my hands five days I
                            cannot consent to the sacrifice of money it must occasion to retain it.

                    that he had done his duty. The new legislature which had not changed materially
                    either in person or political complection met on the 6th of December, 1830. Two

            <p>By the time for the campaign for the election of governor in 1831, the party
                    spirit had developed to such an extent that the candidate's worth was
                    judged by his attitude toward the national question. In the campaign there was a
                    vigorous activity throughout the party organization and an alignment of parties
                    back of candidates but no candidate made the race on the fundamental principle
                    of being a party man. On December 18, 1830, the Jacksonian members of the state
                    legislature met at the governor's house<hi rend="sup">57</hi> and
                    passed a series of resolutions to the effect that all friends of Republicanism

                    as a candidate for governor and David Wallace announced for lieutenant governor.
                    Noble was one of the best known men in the state, he had been removed from the

            <p>Wallace was a promising young lawyer, a graduate of West Point, and for the last
                    three sessions had been a member of the state legislature. These men made no
                    mention of party in their announcements, but their principles were too
                    well-known to need any formal declaration. In May James G. Read of <placeName>

                    concurred in the opinion expressed in the late message of the president on the
                    tariff and internal improvements. He opposed the disorganizing doctrines of
                    southern nullifiers, and those of northern consolidationists. He recognized the

            <p>While the politician, the orator, the partisan press have reached the stage of
                    such acute party alignment that it was practically impossible for a non-partisan

            <p>In 1829 the General Assembly passed a law advancing the time for holding the
                    congressional election from 1830 to 1831, making it occur biennially from the
                    latter date.<hi rend="sup">76</hi> The state and local elections were
                    accompanied this year by a vigorous congressional campaign. In the First

                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName>, the Jacksonian incumbent, was opposed by John Law. Party lines
                    were as usual more closely drawn here than elsewhere. The record of Boone in
                    congress was also an issue. Boone was elected by a vote of 11,281 to 10,905 for
                    Law. His majority was the largest that he had yet received.<hi rend="sup">77</hi>

            <p>In the Second district, where there had previously been practically a unanimous
                    sentiment in favor of Jennings, there were six candidates, Jennings being one of
                    them. While he had always been a Clay man, he had never allowed the national
                    issue to enter into his canvass for election to congress. The development of the
                    party spirit made it almost impossible for an independent to be elected.
                    Jennings' personal habits,<hi rend="sup">78</hi> especially the use of
                    intoxicants, had so weakened him that he could not give as good service at this
                    time as formerly, hence his defeat was practically assured before he entered the
                    race. James B. Ray was also an independent candidate but his troubles during his
                    last term as governor had destroyed his popularity and he stood no chance. John
                    H. Thompson and Isaac Howk were also independent candidates. William W. Wick,

                    was waged between Wick and Carr while the other men depended upon local issues
                    and personal popularity. In the election Carr received 4,855 votes, Wick 4,610,

                    The success of Carr was not due to the fact that voting was carried on along
                    party lines, but rather to the fact that the independent vote was distributed
                    among so many men. Carr's vote was less than one third of the total
                    vote cast.</p>

                    John Test and McCarty became candidates during his absence and made such a
                    thorough campaign that Smith saw his case to be hopeless upon his return and
                    withdrew from the race, giving as his excuse that the one elected would
                    represent a minority and he did not care to do so. By this time however, he had
                    forgotten the dangers of being a minority representative, and while Test was in <placeName>

            <p>The census of 1830 showed such an increase in the population of the state that
                    the number of representatives in the lower house of congress was increased from
                    three to seven. The redistricting of the state caused new alignments of
                    politicians and gave room for many new men. The excitement of the campaign of
                    1832 was followed by a relaxation of party spirit and candidates depended more
                    upon their personal popularity and merits in the election of 1833 than they had
                    done in the two previous congressional elections. The campaign was waged about

            <p>In the election of 1835 there was a decided lull in the party spirit. For

                    McCarty had John Finley and James Rariden op posed to him. In the Sixth, there
                    was not enough opposition to George Kinnard to attract a rival candidate, but in
                    the Seventh, Edward A. Hannegan had two opponents in the persons of Thomas J.
                    Evans and James Gregory. The campaign was remarkably free from the national
                    question. Hannegan declared in his announcement of his candidacy that, should

                    and there still existed a strong tendency towards extravagant expenditure of
                    public funds. Accordingly when Wallace advocated an extensive system of internal
                    improvements at state expense, his popularity was very greatly increased. The
                    Jacksonians, who had only three years previous used all the power of the
                    administration to nominate and elect James G. Read, did not bring out a
                    candidate against Wallace, and John Dumont, a Whig, became his opponent. The
                    appeal for votes was made entirely upon local issues. <quote rend="blockquote">

                    election of Rariden was due to the fact that the Democratic vote was split
                    between McCarty and Thompson. The Western Sun immediately announced that five
                    Democrats and two Federalists had been elected to congress.<hi rend="sup">131</hi> It gave the results of the election of members of the state
                    legislature as ten Democrats and seven Federalists to the senate and 61
                    Democrats and 39 Federalists to the house of representatives. It also claimed
                    for the Democrats a decided majority on joint ballot. The failure of Governor
                    Wallace's scheme for internal improvements perhaps caused the change in
                    the state legislature.</p>
            <p>The political feeling in 1840 was even more intense than it was in 1828. The
                    contest in 1828 had centered about men, and principles entered into the contest
                    only as incidents or political capital. That of 1840 differed from it in that it
                    was a great party struggle. Party success was the first thing aimed at and
                    principles were largely secondary to party and men were yet secondary to
                    principles. While men were brought forward and contests centered about the
                    personality of men it was done not as a reward to men for service nor as a
                    recognition of fitness for office but rather that party success might be
                    attained through the popularity of candidates.</p>
            <p>Both parties were active long before the time for election. The election for
                    governor and for president for the second time both came in the same year, 1840.
                    Party lines were sharply drawn on state issues and both sides felt that the
                    party which elected the governor in August would carry the state for president
                    in November. The Democrats had recovered from their dejection and were more
                    determined than they had ever been before. Their spirit was alarming to the
                    Whigs. O. H. Smith wrote to Clay on September 28,1839, that: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    was on its rise.</p>
            <p>The Whigs were in an awkward situation to begin the campaign. David Wallace, the
                    Whig candidate had been elected governor in 1837 upon the question of internal
                    improvements. He attempted to complete the entire system of roads, canals,
                    railroads, etc., at one time. The state was fortunate in securing loans but was
                    defrauded out of millions by speculators. This, added to the general depression
                    in the money market, caused the system to break down. The state was left heavily
                    in debt with an immense amount of unfinished improvements which yielded no tolls
                    and offered no facilities to farmers for travel and added no value to real
                        estate.<hi rend="sup">186</hi> The failure of Wallace's scheme made
                    it almost impossible for him to be elected in 1840 and his party determined to
                    pass him by. The week following the Democratic convention the Whigs met in
                    convention on January 16, 1840. The delegates began to pour into <placeName>

                    </placeName> four or five days prior to the date of the convention. They came in
                    wagons richly decorated, and sometimes in processions headed by bands, and
                    bearing flashy banners. On the evening of January 15, the assembly met with
                    Samuel Judah of <placeName>

                    monstrous procession in front of the capital and paraded the principal streets
                    of the city. The procession was headed by a large banner bearing the likeness of
                    General Harrison. This was followed by bands with other banners in highly
                    decorated wagons. Near the rear was a banner bearing the inscription,
                    "We are for a government for the people and not for a government of
                    office holders." And on the reverse side it said: "General
                    Harrison has fought more battles than any other general and never sustained a
                    defeat." The rear was brought up by a number of <placeName>

                    </placeName> boys each bearing a flag and wearing a blue sash.</p>
            <p>After parading the streets the procession returned to the State House, but
                    finding it too small to hold the crowd organized in the open air although it was
                    midwinter. Samuel Judah, the author of the first address of the Jacksonians to
                    the people (1824) was made permanent chairman. A number of resolutions were
                    adopted and Samuel Bigger and Samuel Hall were nominated for governor and
                    lieutenant governor respectively.<hi rend="sup">186</hi> Bigger was judge of the
                    Sixth judicial circuit. He was a graduate of Ohio university and a man of strict
                    political and moral integrity. He was over six feet tall, well proportioned,
                    fine faced, blue eyes, prominent forehead, a very commanding appearance, a fair
                    stump speaker, plain and candid in his statements, leaving a lasting impression
                    upon his audience always closing with an eulogy on the life and character of
                    General Harrison.<hi rend="sup">187</hi> The president of the convention
                    appointed a committee of five senators and five representatives to manage the

                    and national.</p>
            <p>The state campaign was merged in the National. Prior to the August election the

                    refused to resign until the close of the session for which he was severely
                    attacked by the Whig papers. Later he did resign to take part in the campaign
                    and the Whigs attacked him for drawing $8.00 per day for
                        electioneering.<hi rend="sup">189</hi> The charge was false, however, Bigger
                    was everywhere called the Federalist candidate by his opponents, while the Whigs
                    complained of their opponent 88 belonging to the "Standing army of Van

                    that he considered the system attempted as too expensive and favored a more
                    limited work according to capital. Since the campaign was waged largely upon the
                    national issues, the memory of the panic of 1837 and the local popularity of
                    Harrison were too much even for the popularity and noble character of Howard.
                    The enthusiasm was almost entirely upon the side of the Whigs and the Democrats
                    were driven to resort to admonition and ridicule. The celebration of the battle

                    Whig to vote for a Whig and a Democrat to vote for a Democrat although neither
                    party had a distinct ticket. From this time forward, national issues determined
                    state elections and independent voting almost ceased to exist.</p>

            <p>In the history of education in Indiana the name of Barnabas C. Hobbs occupies a
                    prominent place. Living at a period when the state's educational system
                    was undergoing some radical changes, he took an ardent and active interest in
                    the up-building and betterment of the schools. To him we may attribute some of
                    the marked transitions in the development of Indiana's schools and
                    school laws and in the epoch of 1836 to 1886â€”a half hundred
                    yearsâ€”he won for himself a niche in the brilliant assemblage of
                    notable Indiana educators. To all the pioneer educators and teachers who labored
                    so earnestly for the cause under adverse conditions, we, of today feel a debt of
                    gratitude for the splendid things they wrought in the cause of education. But in
                    the illustrious group of scholarly men of that era, the figure of Barnabas C.
                    Hobbs appeals to usâ€”the people of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington county</region>
                    </placeName>â€”more strongly because of his nativity. Born in this
                    county, we claim him as our own and honor him as a native son.</p>
            <p>Barnabas C. Hobbs first saw the light of day in a modest but well-to-do pioneer
                    home just a short distance from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, one hundred and seven years ago, yet we bridge the century of time
                    with little effort and endeavor to review the past and gather up the essentials
                    to combine a short sketch of his life. A charm hovers over the people and the
                    things of "yesterday." We believe heartily in that beautiful
                    sentiment expressed by Alphonse Karr, in the words:</p>
            <p>"Not to do honor to old age is to demolish in the morning the house
                    wherein we are to sleep at night."</p>
            <p>Imbued with this idea the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington County</region>
                    </placeName> historical society included in its work as a special feature
                    historical sketches of its early pioneer eminent citizens and families. Under
                    this list of biographies, that of Barnabas C. Hobbs has been written with the
                    hope some student of local or state history may be benefitted by its
                    preparation.</p>

            <p>Barnabas Hobbs was born October 4, 1815 in an attractive and favored section of

                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and about one-half mile west of Canton. He was the son of
                    William and Priscilla Coffin Hobbs, who came to Indiana from Guilford county, <placeName>

                    children have ever since been members of the Society of Friends. Priscilla
                    Coffin was the daughter of Samuel and Mary Coffin. She became the bride of
                    William Hobbs 1799, 8th day of the 8th month. In an autobiography of William
                    Hobbs, edited by his son Professor B. C. Hobbs, William Hobbs says. "We
                    had but little of this world's goods to begin with and land was very
                    poor. We had to work very hard and having an increasing family, I learned the

                    With many emigrants faring forth to a new country, they came in the spring of
                    1812 to Indiana territory and settled on the headwaters of Blue River, in what

                    near them and thus the nucleus for pleasant worship of a common faith was
                    started. From this time on there predominated in the life of this family that
                    religious and Godly Christian living, the influence of which blended and formed
                    the character of their son Barnabas C. Hobbs. Under the teachings of these
                    strong determined characters that emigrated from the old North State he imbided
                    the firm and indomitable traits of his pioneer forefathers. As a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> minister William Hobbe was zealous and earnest and much of his time
                    was spent in travel (horse back) to the meetings he served.</p>
            <p>Three years after the death of Priscilla Coffin, whose piety and faith was as
                    devout as that of her husband, William Hobbs was again married (1839) to Anna
                    Unthank, an approved minister of the Friends church of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and <pb n="284" id="VAA4025-019-3-076"/> thus his
                    ministerial calling and duties were strengthened and blessed in the union.</p>
            <p>In this work of gospel preaching and teaching, his son Barnabas Coffin Hobbs,
                    followed his father's footsteps and became a noted minister of the
                    Society of Friends and was probably the greatest scholar of Bible literature in
                    any Friends church.</p>
            <p>Barnabas Hobbs was the youngest of a family of eight childrenâ€”having
                    two brothers and five sisters. At the age of about six years, his parents moved
                    to Martin county. His boyhood was spent on the farm where he learned to hunt,
                    fish, swim and enjoy all the sports of that day and generation. At an early age
                    he evinced a strong liking for books and his future as student, teacher and
                    scholar seemed assured by the time he reach his sixteenth birthday. At the age
                    of eighteen he taught his first school. This was in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana.</p>
            <p>At about this timeâ€”during the decade of 1830â€”he became a
                    pupil of John I. Morrison, "The Hoosier Arnold" at the <placeName>

                    B. Sturgis, W. C. De Pauw, Elijah Newland, Thomas Rodman and Nathan Kimball.</p>
            <p>In the year 1837-38 he was assistant principal of the Blue River Friends academy

                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the following year served as principal of the school. This
                    practically closed his career in his native county.</p>

                    1892, at Bloomingdale, Indiana, gives the outstanding events of his life: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Professor Hobbs was born near <placeName>

                            he taught his first term of school. His pupils numbered forty and many
                            of them his seniors. In 1837 he entered the <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                            </placeName> college. He chose an elective rather than a regular course,
                            and hence was not eligible to the honor of a degree on his withdrawal in
                            1839, though he was recognized as possessing all that is implied by a
                            thorough college training and subsequently received a master's
                            degree from Wabash college.</p>
                        <p>In 1839 he assumed charge of a boarding school at Mount Pleasant, <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                            </placeName>, and remained at the head of that institution until 1843,
                            when <pb n="285" id="VAA4025-019-3-077"/> he married and removed to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                            </placeName>, Indiana. He established a school there and conducted it
                            for four years with marked success. The Society of Friends then
                            established a school, of which he was made superintendent. In 1851 he
                            was chosen to the superintendency of the Bloomingdale, (Ind.) academy,
                            where he continued for sixteen years. In 1866, he was appointed by
                            Governor Morton, a member of the board of trustees of the new State
                            Normal school. In the same year he was elected the first president of
                            Earlham college at <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                            </placeName>. At the end of two years he was elected superintendent of
                            public instruction.</p>
                        <p>Immediately after the electionâ€”in October
                            186Gâ€”Superintendent Hoss resigned his office, and Mr. Hobbs
                            was appointed by the governor to fill the vacancy, the regular term not
                            commencing until about five months later. Superintendent Hobbs was thus
                            left to make the biennial report of 1868. It is unique in style and most
                            interesting in substance. He presented the cause of the colored people
                            in a masterly manner. On the 28th of July of that year the fourteenth
                            amendment had been declared a part of the constitution.</p>
                        <p>Superintendent Hobbs was among the first in his country to give attention
                            to the subject of graded public schools. It was his idea that the rural
                            schools should prepare pupils systematically for the high schools and
                            the latter for the State university. In 1869 he issued a new edition of
                            the school law, and in 1870 he made his second report to the
                            legislature. Disappointed in his effort to secure needed legislation, it
                            remained for him to do what he might to promote the efficiency of the
                            school system as it was. He labored to secure the levying of a special
                            tuition tax where it was necessary to -tend the school term.</p>
                        <p>He retired from the department in 1871, and immediately returned to
                            Bloomingdale, where he again assumed charge of the academy. In all the
                            years that followed he has been a very busy man. In 1872 he made a
                            geological survey of Parke county. As trustee of the State Normal school
                            and of the Rose Polytechnic, he has contributed largely to their
                            success.</p>
                        <p>In 1879, the Friends of America were moved to send a message to
                            Alexander, the Emperor of Russia, and another to William, the'
                            Emperor of <placeName>
                                <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                            </placeName>. Professor Hobbs was chosen to perform this mission. At St. <placeName>

                            </placeName> he left with the prime minister, a memorial, which urged
                            that the mennonites of the empire-a sect conscientiously opposed to
                            war-might be relieved from military service. At Berlin, Professor Hobbs
                            presented the Crown Prince a memorial which advocated the settlement of
                            international disputes by arbitration, rather than by war. For some
                            years, Professor Hobbs worked in the interest of Indian Education in <placeName>

                            reference to the descendants of aborigines in those states he has
                            secured the sanction and aid of the government. He made an enumeration
                            of the Cherokees of the reservation and determined their share of
                            apportionments of revenue authorized by the <pb n="286" id="VAA4025-019-3-078"/> general congressâ€”which share had
                            been diverted from its purpose by errors and frauds. Professor Hobbs was
                            noted as a clear and forcible speaker, a logical thinker and graceful
                            writer. No member of the Society of Friends in this country was so
                            widely known.</p>

                        <p>The death of Dr. Barnabas C. Hobbs occured last Wednesday afternoon and
                            came much sooner than was expected, though fears were entertained that
                            his sickness would be fatal. He went to Michigan for relief but did not
                            obtain it and was brought to his home in Blooming-dale on Monday. He
                            rapidly failed until the end came. After an attack of the grip some
                            months since, he was further depressed by the action of the Bloomingdale
                            meeting, charging him with teaching false doctrine, and the many attacks
                            that have been made on him in one way and another by those who were not
                            worthy to unlatch his shoes. Yellow jaundice was the final cause of his
                            death.</p>
                        <p>Professor Hobbs, as he was more familiarly known, was one of the best
                            known men of the Society of Friends in the world; he was head of the
                            Bloomingdale meeting and was a man of unusual attainments. He was a ripe
                            scholar, a man of stern and uncompromising integrity, and a good man in
                            every sense. Many of the younger generation of men in Parke county, and
                            particularly those of the Friends church, were under him while he was
                            principal of the Bloomingdale academy and remember him with reverence
                            and good will. Any one of them who has followed in his footsteps is
                            today a good man without doubt. His influence was wholesome at all
                            times. These school sons of his rise up and call him blessed.</p>
                        <p>He was a stately gentleman of the old school, kind and courteous, grave,
                            as became a man of his position, but with a keen sense of humor. Like
                            all of his church during the war he was an uncomprising Republican and
                            stood for his country at all times. He did not desert his party but
                            maintained its principles to the close of his life. For this, much fault
                            was found with him by those who thought he ought to join another party.
                            But he was doubtless as conscientious in his belief as they were in
                            theirs. Professor Hobbs occupied many positions of honor and usefulness
                            in his long life, as may be seen by the biographical sketch printed in
                            this issue. In all these he was equal to the occasion, doing his work
                            modestly and promptly and with a high regard for duty.</p>
                        <p>The funeral, which took place at nine o'clock Saturday morning
                            at Bloomingdale church, was largely attended, not only by people from
                            the vicinity, but by numbers abroad. Persons were present from <placeName>

            <p>On Sunday, after the death of Barnabas C. Hobbs which occurred Wednesday June 22,
                    1892, a memorial service in his honor was held at the Friend's church
                    in Bloomingdale, at three o'clock p. m. It is said "that
                    friends and acquaintances, those who had known the distinguished educator for
                    more than a quarter of a century, as well as those who had seen him only in the
                    last years of his life, the governor of the state, members of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> bar, ministers of varied denominations, his former students now
                    middle aged men and women, Sunday school teachers and scholars, citizens and
                    strangers," formed the assembly, paying public tribute to his
                    abilities, his exalted character and his eminent services to the church and
                    state.</p>
            <p>Among the speakers of the afternoon was Governor Ira J. Chase, who said he came
                    to represent the state and also to pay his tribute of respect to the memory of
                    the deceased, as a friend. Governor Chase spoke of the services of Dr. Hobbs in
                    behalf of peace among nations and his labors in behalf of the Indians. These
                    topics were outstanding points in his address. The Hon. Thomas N. Rice delivered
                    a noble eulogy, in which his intellectual abilities, and moral character were
                    clearly set out. Mr. Rice made special mention of the valuable services of
                    Professor Hobbs in perfecting the school laws of Indiana and establishing our
                    present school system. He said that hardly a measure had passed the legislature
                    in reference to our common schools but had first received the examination and
                    sanction of Barnabas C. Hobbs.</p>

                        <p>My father visited personally every public school in Indiana twice while
                            he was in the position of superintendent of public inetruction. He <pb n="288" id="VAA4025-019-3-080"/> did not leave this to others as
                            many other superintendents did. In this way he was very helpful to young
                            teachers. He saw the great need of a first class normal school and
                            advocated the building of such a school. Thus, the Normal School of <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                            </placeName> was started. He was always a strong advocate of the higher
                            education of woman and through him or his influence Bryn Mawr college
                            was opened up.</p>
                        <p>In his lifetime he was given at different times three degrees of L. L. D.
                            He was probably the greatest scholar of Bible literature in any
                            Friend's church. He was a man who always lived and thought
                            ahead of his time. This is the reason many at Bloomingdale failed to
                            appreciate him or rather failed to understand him. This is why some of
                            them claimed he preached "unsound doctrine," because
                            he so often preached from the Old Testament. They thought he should
                            confine himself to the New Testament.</p>

                            and a friend asked him if he would not like to go and hear it. He went.
                            The professor said in his lecture that the best public schools in the U.
                            S. were in Indiana and made so by a man named Barnabas Hobbs. This was

                            my mother was living and where he met and married her. Father was always
                            dignified and mother was a young, bright, happy girl. Father was
                            twenty-eight years old when he married my mother who was twenty-four
                            year old. When he brought her to <placeName>

                            time he took her to meeting an old friend came to him and told him he
                            was ashamed of him to marry such a pretty young girl. My father asked
                            him how old he thought my mother was and he replied: "Not more
                            than sixteen, if that old." "Well," said
                            father, "she is twenty-four," but the man would not
                            believe it. Mother always looked younger than her years. Father was
                            slender and delicate but by careful living, taking regular exercises, he
                            grew stronger With the years. His eyes were blue gray, his hair a very
                            light, almost yellow, and at sixteen years it began to turn white and
                            was all white at twenty years of age. I am the only one of the family
                            who inherited this white hair and I have had white hair since I was
                            twenty years old. Neither of us ever was gray. He was five feet, eleven
                            and one-half inches tall and until his later years was very slender.
                            While father always carried his dignity, he enjoyed a joke as well as
                            any one.</p>

                            of course his clothing became thoroughly infected with the fumes of
                            tobacco. When he arrived and was met at the door by his friend, Bevon

            <p>The State School for the Blind, is in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and is now 75 years old. Here can be accommodated 125 pupils, 16
                    teachers, and other officers to the number of 54 persons. This is not a
                    charitable institution, but for educational purposes only; and the cost to the
                    state, per capita, is $568.83.</p>
            <p>Children over eight or under 21, if passing health requirements, may be admitted;
                    and 12 years are required for graduation. The outline of work in this School for
                    Blind is as nearly like that of our common schools as it is possible to make it.
                    The character of this school at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the work accomplished here is very similar to that of any blind
                    school of any other state.</p>
            <p>The text-books are in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Point, except in grades 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in which the revised
                    Braille, grade 1 1/2 has been introduced.</p>
            <p>Much attention is given to memorizing work, typewriting, Sloyd (desk manual
                    training), and a 45 minute period of each day is devoted to reading aloud from
                    standard authors.</p>
            <p>There are four departments, Literary, Music, Industrial and Physical Training.
                    Forty credits are required for graduation from the first two departments, and
                    all students must take a certain amount of work in the other two.</p>
            <p>Chorus classes are required throughout the year, and is the most general division
                    of the Music department. There are classes in Voice, Piano, Organ, String and
                    Wind instruments, Recital and Chapel work, and History and Composition.</p>
            <p>In the Manual Training department are taught many of the useful arts and trades
                    that, in later life, will enable graduates to become skilfully and gainfully
                    employed; to take their places alongside other graduates of our public schools.</p>
            <p>In several states a fee of $100.00 is given each graduate of this
                    department, (if his circumstances warrant it), with which to purchase tools and
                    material. This would enable him to start in business for himself, thus
                    eliminating a great deal of <pb n="292" id="VAA4025-019-3-084"/> anxiety.
                    Several attempts have been made to establish a fund to assist our worthy blind,
                    after graduation; but, in Indiana, this is not settled, as yet. It is to be
                    hoped that philanthropic friends of this institution will make this part of such
                    a worthy cause a permanent arrangement.</p>
            <p>As a result of the efficient work done in our School for Blind, many of its
                    graduates are encouraged to take up higher education. What a stupendous task,
                    when one considers all the handicaps. What an amount of ambition, pluck and
                    patience must be behind a resolve like that: though blind, to complete a College
                    course! How many of us, in like condition, would attempt it?</p>
            <p>There are in Indiana university, at the present time, three students who have
                    passed under the careful training of Mr. George S. Wilson, for 25 years the
                    superintendent and director of Indiana's School for Blind. These
                    students are doing excellent work, and merit worthy mention, according to the
                    secretary of Indiana university.</p>
            <p>They are: Everett Addington of Farmland who is tuning pianos to help defray his
                    expenses, and who has been honored with a political office in his county; Russel
                    Ray Judd of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, totally blind.</p>
            <p>A thorough search of the colleges of Indiana rewards us with other students: Ray
                    Johnson is attending Chiropractor college at <placeName>

                    Law. According to President Bowman, "he was a student of unusual
                    intelligence and remarkable working ability."</p>
            <p>Each blind student of a university in Indiana is now furnished with a reader, at
                    'the expense of the state.</p>
            <p>Another force for the betterment of the condition of our Indiana blind is the
                    Industrial Aid for Blind, a state institution. <pb n="293" id="VAA4025-019-3-085"/> This aims to meet the adult blind, all over the
                    state, in their own homes. In this way busy mothers (blind) who cannot leave
                    their families or their work, may be taught to read raised type, and thus become
                    able to use books and periodicals from the State Library. They are taught to do
                    sewing, crocheting, knitting, rug and basket-making, and other useful arts.</p>
            <p>Adult male blind are taught chair-caning, rug-weaving, broom-making,
                    brush-making, mop-making, and needle-craft. As broom-making is more arduous than
                    rug or basket-weaving, the very aged blind are taught the latter arts.</p>
            <p>In connection with this work, field agents canvass the state, seeking out the
                    blind who are eager for instruction, especially lessons in hygiene and
                    home-making.</p>
            <p>Mr. C. D. Chadwick, the executive secretary of the Industrial Aid for the Blind
                    reports 1,922 calls made in 1922. Of these 519 were for the purpose of
                    instruction.</p>
            <p>Once or twice each year is held in <placeName>

                    Womens' Clubs of Indiana have charge of these bazaars, and the money
                    realized is given to the persons who did the work.</p>
            <p>The first blind man in Indiana to finish a college course was Fred Morton
                    McCartney, totally blind, having been left so from measles contracted when he
                    was 17 months old. He was born at Flat Rock, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Shelby county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, 1887, and was one among eight children. He entered the
                    State School for Blind when he was 6 1/2 years old, beginning in the
                    kindergarten.</p>
            <p>He was still in the lower grades when Mr. Wilson took charge of the school (1898)
                    and Mr. McCartney, in his story of his life, avers that he will always remember
                    Mr. Wilson for getting him started right in his school career.</p>
            <p>Fred McCartney completed the four years high school course in three years, by
                    working at his books all vacation and taking examinations in the Fall. He
                    specialized in the Literary department, carrying piano-tuning, Sloyd and some
                    music.</p>
            <p>In 1909 he entered Indiana university. He was the pioneer in this field, and of
                    course had no reader. His only assets were <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-019-3-086"/>
                    ambition and grit; piano-tuning was the only thing he could do to help buy
                    books, pay fees, and other college expenses; and his parents and friends were
                    skeptical about his being able to compete with the sighted.</p>
            <p>He was a problem to the university, and a puzzle to himself, the solving of which
                    made many of the professors rub their heads and think. Where to place him, and
                    what to do with him? He was the topic for discussion at many a faculty meeting.
                    He groped about for several weeks trying to find a place to anchor. Never once
                    did he despair or falter. He says he knew he would find some way out of his
                    dilemma, for his yearning for a college education was so strong.</p>
            <p>Realizing, at last, that this young man really meant to do just what he had
                    undertaken, his parents moved to Blooming-ton, the better to aid him. (Even yet
                    they doubted the outcome of such an unheard of venture.)</p>
            <p>At this time the story of Helen Keller was fresh in the minds of everyone and
                    Fred McCartney thought that he, with fewer handicaps than she, might try the
                    college course. So he secured the necessary readers, at his own and his
                    fathers's expense, engaged work in piano-tuning, and thus started on
                    his freshman year.</p>
            <p>But right in the very beginning he met a stumbling block in mathematics. After
                    much consultation, the professors permitted him to substitute American Poetry
                    and Psychology, both of which were his favorite subjects. He signed up for all
                    the other required subjects, and, in addition, took <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> and French.</p>
            <p>All his notes, note-books, themes, examinations, were prepared on an ordinary
                    typewriter, after having the keyboard fitted with the French accent marks, and
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> Umlaut.</p>
            <p>In 1910 he successfully passed the state teachers's examination for
                    grades, and for High School English, and later, History. He took a course in
                    Astronomy, under Professor Cogshall, and found the study most fascinating. He
                    was especially fond of Professor Lindley, Psychology; and of Professor
                    Stephenson, English.</p>
            <pb n="295" id="VAA4025-019-3-087"/>
            <p>In 1912 he received his A.B. degree. The following year he enrolled for the A.M.
                    degree, with Psychology as his research subject. He won his second degree in
                    1914.</p>
            <p>Mr. McCartney was married in 1914. In 1918 he went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> as piano-tuner with the Werner Industries Company where he remained
                    until 1921.</p>
            <p>At present he is with the <placeName>

            <p>Fred McCartney, overcoming all obstacles, spent six years in hard work at Indiana
                    university. He says his dreams of usefulness have not been realized. However
                    that may be, he has set an example for the other blind of our state, and of
                    other states. His was the great task, and with infinite patience he kept at it.
                    It is not a glorious thing he has done, but, nevertheless he deserves what he
                    literally carved, by dint of hard chiseling: Fred McCartney, Indiana's
                    first blind college graduateâ€”1912.</p>
            <p>The first blind woman in Indiana to complete a college course was Lola Lydia
                    Walling, born in the village of Pennville, Jay county, Indiana, December 20,
                    1892. Her mother, Josephine Underwood Walling, was the daughter of Isaac
                    Underwood, farmer, merchant, manufacturer, treasurer of Jay county, state
                    representative, and state senator. He was a Master <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Mason</region>
                    </placeName>, a Good Templar and a leader in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> Church.</p>
            <p>Lola's father, Lewis Grissell Walling, was the grandson of the founder
                    of the tom of Pennville, sometimes known as Camden and New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lisbon</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Grisells were all Hicksite Friends. Lewis Walling was a
                    druggist and a farmer.</p>
            <p>So it was in a home that used the plain language of thee and thou that this
                    beautiful brown-eyed maiden, bearing the name so beloved of all Quakers, Lydia,
                    was born. And if ever a child was born with the silver spoon, this girl was the
                    subject of our sketch. She was the idol of all her relatives and they were a
                    goodly array of worthy, enterprising citizens. Not only was she lovely of face,
                    but she was lovable of disposition, talented and industrious.</p>
            <p>The Walling home was noted for culture and refinement and its many social
                    gatherings. It was a great, rambling house of twenty rooms, a wing of which was
                    used by grandfather <pb n="296" id="VAA4025-019-3-088"/> and grandmother
                    Underwood. Here, the golden-haired girl spent many happy hours listening to
                    stories told by her aged grandfather, and in watching the process of
                    cookie-making bread and pie-making, in which the grandmother was always engaged.</p>
            <p>The great, old-fashioned attic was also one of her favorite places; for here were
                    stored treasures of trunk, of chest, box, and drawer, the relics of many
                    generations of Grisells, Wallings and Underwoods. Many of the things here had
                    been brought from "way back east." This attic was typical of
                    the many attics of the old town.</p>
            <p>The library, too, was a place where the child spent many hours; for here were the
                    large oil paintings, the portraits of her ancestors, gazing down at her from
                    their great gold frames. Here, too, were the cases of specimens and relics that
                    had been continuously in her father's family for more than a century.
                    Often she had been tempted to open those glass cases and to take out the
                    cherished specimens; but there was ever the strict admonition of her father
                    checking that desire. It was this: "Lola, thee must not look with thy
                    fingers, look with thy eyes."</p>
            <p>In after years those words were to be vividly recalled by all the family: Thee
                    must not look with thy fingers. It was literally the very thing that she was
                    forced to do. When Lola was just beginning the eighth grade she had an attack of
                    the Grippe which lasted many weeks. When she recovered from this, it was found
                    that she was semi-blind. All that medical skill could do was tried; but of no
                    avail. She is, today, unable to read; or to do close work of any kind, though
                    she distinguishes faces and objects, and travels everywhere unaided.</p>
            <p>Although the shock of this misfortune was terrible for the parents, the mother,
                    with true heroism, set to work. She was determined that Lola should have the
                    education that now seemed so unattainable. The living-room of the Walling home
                    was converted into a class-room, provided with black-boards, charts, maps,
                    globes, and all things pertaining to school work.</p>
            <p>So carefully and thoroughly did this mother instruct the daughter that, although
                    she was present in the public school <pb n="297" id="VAA4025-019-3-089"/> but a
                    few days of the nine month session, she was enabled to finish with her class, at
                    the eighth grade commencement, carrying off first honors; in fact taking highest
                    rank in Penn township, and second highest in Jay county.</p>
            <p>During the vacation Lola continued her piano lessons under competent instruction
                    of Mrs. Nellie Place Chandler and Mrs. Edna Line Gordon. The notes being read to
                    her, then played for her, she quickly memorized them. Even at that age, she was
                    considered a very remarkable pianist. Mrs. Gordon has often declared that Lola
                    Walling was the aptest music pupil she ever found.</p>
            <p>Lola entered the School for Blind at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, taking the literary course. She had to acquire the point system,
                    and accustom herself to this new mode of living in a community of Mind, where
                    lights at night were not a necessity, as the inmates walked by remembering each
                    detail of the building; and where looking with the fingers was the only way.</p>
            <p>She spent five years here, not only taking the piano instruction which the school
                    afforded, but having a private teacher as well. Her musical instruction now was
                    in the point system.</p>
            <p>Lola's mother had learned point and typing, and was enabled to keep up a
                    correspondence with her which was very encouraging and helpful; and lessened the
                    homesickness from which she sometimes suffered. She graduated on the honor roll.</p>
            <p>Now came a time for decision. Lola wished to go to college. There was but one way
                    to accomplish this, and with her wonted unselfishness the mother disposed of the
                    matter. She would go to college with her daughter.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Walling's brother, Charles Underwood, was professor of sacred
                    history at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> college. The mother and daughter decided to attend <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Accordingly she arranged her household affairs in the little home
                    town and, taking her son Kenneth, now in high school, the three of them became
                    domiciled in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Lola registered at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> college, and the mother began her duties of reader, secretary,
                    critic, housekeeper and companion for the daughter in college, and the son in
                    high school.</p>
            <pb n="298" id="VAA4025-019-3-090"/>
            <p>Every book that was required of her, each lesson, each reference, extra line of
                    work, examination, theme, was attended to by this careful mother. Eyes and soul
                    she was striving to help the girl who had been deprived of her vision. How well
                    she succeeded has been proven.</p>
            <p>Lola completed the four years' course, majoring in English, and she was
                    one of the honor graduates of 1917. The mother, having had only the advantages
                    of the common schools, returned to the village of Pennville with a college
                    education. True, she did not receive a parchment and her name w88 never on any
                    roll of honor or engraven on cup or medal. But with Cornelia of old, she had
                    proven that her children were her jewels, and as such she considered that no
                    sacrifice was too great for their sakes. Modestly she slipped back home, and
                    into her old place among her neighbors.</p>
            <p>After completing the course at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> Miss Walling continued piano instruction under the best professors,
                    and is now prepared to give recitals. When at home she assists in home talents,
