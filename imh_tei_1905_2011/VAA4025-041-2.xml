            <p>The first state constitution of Indiana included a passage in which it was affirmed that
                    "knowledge and learning generally diffused, through a community," are
                    "essential to the preservation of a free government." A more definite provision
                    declared: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It shall be the duty of the General Assembly as soon as circumstances shall permit, to
                            provide, by law, for a general system of education, ascending in a regular gradation, from
                            township schools to a state university, wherein tuition shall be gratis, and equally open to
                            all.</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>Any intelligent young Hoosier of today who is in the process of being educated in the vast and
                    complex school system of his state would naturally suppose, when examining the constitution of 1816
                    for the first time, that public schools were established very soon after the admission of Indiana to
                    the Union. In this very natural assumption, he would be sadly mistaken. For long years, the fine
                    phrases relative to education in the old constitution of 1816 were only noticed by political
                    leaders, legislators, and men of property when delivering public speeches. Worse than this, perhaps,
                    was the inertia of the majority of the people in regard to the serious educational conditions and
                    the lack of effective legislation to remedy them.</p>
            <p>The unconcern in regard to providing public schools through taxation continued for more than a
                    generation, while Indiana grew in population, in wealth and in political importance among the states
                    of the nation. After the taking of the census of 1850, Indiana found herself to be seventh <list type="footnotes">

                    representatives in the national house and in the number of presidential electors, the state was tied
                    with <placeName>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> By 1850, therefore, Indiana had become an important state
                    politically, certainly not to be ignored by the national party leaders. With her accumulated and
                    increasing wealth, the Hoosier state was well able to levy and collect sufficient taxes to
                    inaugurate a system of free, public schools. That public education was not provided before the
                    middle of the century was due to the lack of effective leadership, to the general lassitude and to
                    the determined opposition of powerful elements–not to the absence of means.</p>
            <p>It is a sad fact that, in spite of the clauses in favor of public education embodied in the
                    constitution of 1816, a view was widely held or accepted in Indiana that education was not for the
                    masses. This was accompanied by the belief that good men were more to be desired than educated men
                    and the further notion that schooling would unfit people for manual labor. Whether the people were
                    really converted to these ideas or not, there is no doubt that there existed an intense and bitter
                    opposition among various elements of Indiana to the early efforts to establish public schools. It
                    was reported by a prominent educational leader in 1876, that a "member of the Legislature,
                    in 1837, closed his … speech in these words: "When I die, I want my epitaph
                    written, "Here lies an enemy to free schools."" "<hi rend="sup">3</hi> In the year 1848, one of the counties of central Indiana, voting on the question of

                    </placeName> College wrote a series of six "Messages" designed to produce an
                    active effort to raise the deplorable educational level that prevailed in Indiana. He kept his name
                    a secret, adding to each "Message" the signature "One of the
                    People." These "Messages" were prepared and delivered to legislators at
                    the opening of each of five sessions and to the members of the constitutional convention of
                    1850-1851. The "Messages" exerted quite an influence on senators, representatives,
                    constitution makers, and educational leaders and teachers who were special advocates of a public
                    school system. The agitation stimulated by the "Messages" was to become more
                    effective and contagious as the years passed. Professor Mills not only gave practical plans for
                    organizing a school system but he argued for his plans and presented facts to shame the state to
                        action.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The legislature provided for a referendum on the question of free
                    schools in 1848. In a total vote of 140,410, there was a majority of 16,636 in favor of free
                    schools. The citizens were not voting for or against elementary education, but on the question
                    whether elementary education should be provided through public taxation or whether the people should
                    be content with what was being furnished by denominational or private schools.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another outcome of the agitation was the school law of 1849, which was submitted to a popular
                    referendum despite the fact that the people had just voted in favor of free schools. The law of 1849
                    seems crude enough now, but there was provision for a minimum school term of three months, and, for
                    the first time, restricted taxation by local units was authorized for the support of schools. The
                    total vote in the popular referendum of 1849 was slightly larger than that cast in the free schools
                    referendum of the preceding year, and the majority in favor of the law slightly less than the
                    majority <list type="footnotes">

                    county could vote again in any later year during the continuance of the law. Several counties never
                    approved it and therefore were subject only to previously enacted school laws until later
                    legislation superseded them.</p>
            <p>The new constitution which was framed in 1850-1851 and ratified in August of 1851, included
                    provisions relative to education that were very similar to those of the first constitution. The
                    greater part of Article VIII, which deals with "Education," is made up of sections
                    devoted to the Common School Fund, but the first section states that it shall be the duty of the
                    General Assembly "to provide by law for a general and uniform system of common schools,
                    wherein tuition shall be without charge, and equally open to all." The last or eighth
                    section of the article on education relates to the establishment by law of the office of State
                    Superintendent of Public Instruction. In 1852 the General Assembly passed breath-taking school
                    legislation. The laws passed provided for taxation by local units to pay for the erection of
                    buildings, for equipping them, and for supplementing the funds distributed by the state for tuition
                    purposes. In accordance with the mandatory provision of the new constitution, the legislature set up
                    the office of State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and also created the first State Board of
                    Education which was not required by the constitution. The new school legislation became effective in
                    1853. The first State Superintendent, Professor William C. Larabee of Indiana Asbury (DePauw)
                    University, was elected in 1852 and took office in the same year. The State Board was at first made
                    up entirely of state officials, all ex officio members.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>Beginning in 1853, new taxes were levied, new school-houses were erected and more teachers employed.
                    In 1852 cities and incorporated towns were separated from the new civil townships in which they were

                    permitted township authorities to levy taxes for the purpose of "continuing their
                    schools" after state funds should be expended to be unconstitutional. This decision left
                    the townships, in regard to the expense of tuition, with only the funds apportioned by the state
                    which were very inadequate. Cities and incorporated towns escaped the demoralizing effects of this
                    decision. Not satisfied with their good fortune, these units asked for and obtained a law in 1855
                    granting more generous taxing powers. This law met the same fate at the hands of the Supreme Court
                    in 1857 as had the section of the law of 1852 pertaining to taxation by townships.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> As a result of the court decisions of 1854 and 1857, the promising movement in the

                    the face of handicaps they kept up the struggle and made some progress.</p>
            <p>In the year 1867, the legislature became bold enough to restore to townships, incorporated towns and
                    cities the power to levy and collect taxes for the payment of wages to public schoolteachers. During
                    the years of enforced delay, school sentiment had increased and educational leaders were able to
                    persuade members of the General Assembly to make a new effort. Arguments were vigorously put forward
                    that a new law would probably not be contested, and, even should it be challenged, the Supreme Court
                    would not likely declare it void. It was in fact nearly a score of years before a case was devised
                    to test the validity of the act of 1867, and then the Supreme Court declared it to be
                    constitutional. The constitution had not been changed and the same point was at issue, but the
                    judges did not come to the same conclusions. This favorable court decision was rendered in 1885,
                    eighteen years after the passage of the contested law and thirty-one years after the adverse
                    decision of 1854. The case before the Supreme Court in 1885 was that of Robinson, Treasurer, <hi rend="i">v.</hi> Schenck. It was brought up from the circuit court of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland County</region>
                    </placeName>, where an injunction was sought and granted in favor of the property owner who was the
                    complainant. The Supreme Court overruled the finding of the lower court which was based on the
                    contention laid down by the Supreme Court judges in 1854 and 1857 that taxes for tuition could be
                    levied only by the legislature. In 1885 the judges of the Supreme Court held that the section of the
                    state constitution commanding the legislature to "provide <list type="footnotes">

                            Hoosiers were stimulated to great exertions because they had permitted themselves to be
                            "left in the rear by more active sister states." This was in 1876 when
                            Indiana was so rapidly catching up. Shortly after Barnabas C. Hobbs had retired from the
                            office of State Superintendent on March 15, he wrote: "We must work while we</item>
               </list>
                    <pb n="113" id="VAA4025-041-2-011"/> by law for a general and uniform system of common
                    schools" does not mean that all taxes must be directly levied by the state. In the earlier
                    decisions the judges had taken the stand that local units could levy and collect taxes to build
                    school-houses and buy equipment but not for tuition purposes. In 1885 the judges declared that it
                    was "not possible to make any distinction between the right to employ persons to impart
                    instruction to the pupils and the right to provide places where the instruction shall be
                        imparted."<hi rend="sup">14</hi> It should be remembered that this decision was hailed
                    with delight because it meant a work already largely performed would not be halted or destroyed.</p>
            <p>The great awakening had followed the passage of the law of 1867. In much of the state, the task of
                    creating free, public schools for all started at once. New school buildings were erected, teachers
                    hired, and more schools opened while the process of levying and collecting the taxes was going on.
                    By 1875 the number of schoolteachers in Indiana had trebled, school attendance had increased by a
                    quarter of a million, and teachers' wages from public funds by two and a half million
                    dollars. From 1875 to 1890, the movement for longer terms, more schools and better schools
                    continued. Struggling against very discouraging conditions from 1857 to 1867, the crusade that was
                    so well under way by 1870 gained such momentum that nothing could stop the people and their leaders.
                    In a score of years, the free, public school system of Indiana was created—a veritable
                    miracle accomplished.</p>
            <p>Prior to the awakening, secondary education was provided by academies, seminaries, and the
                    preparatory departments of higher institutions. Colleges frequently had more preparatory students
                    than students of college standing, and there were comparatively few of either rank. The vast
                    majority of the young persons of Indiana had no opportunity to obtain either secondary or college
                    instruction before 1870. They were fortunate indeed if they had access to elementary schools.</p>
            <p>Only about twenty-five Indiana high schools were started before 1870, all but five of them after
                    1860. Among the <list type="footnotes">

                    accessible to the youth of cities and various incorporated towns, but hosts of children living in
                    rural areas were not yet included in the charmed circle. This was true not only of Indiana as pretty
                    much the same situation prevailed over large portions of the country. By 1890 many colleges had done
                    away with their preparatory schools or were in the process of liquidating them. Since there were
                    still numerous students without high school training, many private "normal
                    colleges" grew up and flourished, with low charges for board, room, and tuition. These made
                    little or no distinction between students who were of college status and those who were not. Many
                    teachers with few or no credits beyond the eighth grade flocked to these institutions, of which
                    Indiana had more than a few. Indeed, the speed limit was exceeded in regard to the setting up of
                    normal schools of this category in the state.</p>
            <p>It was at the beginning of the great awakening that the Indiana State Normal School of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Purdue University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> were founded. These two state institutions opened their doors just when there were, for
                    the first time in the history of Indiana, considerable numbers of young persons on hand for whom
                    college was possible. Not until this time, did conditions prevail that permitted more than a small
                    contingent of ambitious young people to go away from home to obtain an education. It was not only
                    the State Normal School and Purdue University that grew in the era of the awakening, but older
                    institutions of the state that had struggled along for decades with few students, limited means, and
                    small faculties likewise began to grow. Indiana University, summoned to exist by a law of 1820 as

                    "Indiana University" in 1838, was a very small institution as late as 1870.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Its period of real expansion began in the midst of the rapid development of
                    the free, public school system, that is, during the great awakening that marked the score of years
                    ending in 1890. Purdue University was not opened to students until 1874, but it became an
                    institution of importance by 1890. The interesting truth is, therefore, that Indiana University
                    experienced its first noticeable growth simultaneously with the State Normal School and Purdue
                    University. The fourth of Indiana's state supported educational institutions, Ball State
                    Teachers College, founded in 1918, became a large school so quickly that the annals of its youthful
                    struggles are brief enough to be almost negligible.</p>
            <p>With great obstacles to be surmounted, several Hoosier cities had laid the educational foundations on

                    superintendents of these school systems had not obtained the extensive training required of city
                    superintendents today, but they were up with the best. Many of them were men who were able to take
                    advantage of the opportunities that came to them and no other class of the times outdistanced them
                    in the doing of work of high quality. They were prone to accompany their performance of
                    administrative duties with extensive reading and intensive thinking, especially in the field of
                    philosophy. In addition, they were tremendously interested in the problem of improving the teaching
                    done in their schools. The numbers of schools, teachers, and pupils multiplied so rapidly that the
                    supply of experienced teachers, who also possessed ability, was relatively small. The consequence
                    was that almost every city superintendent was of necessity a strong advocate of teacher training,
                    knowing well that most of his teachers needed both more knowledge and better methods. It is not
                    strange that the period of the awakening produced a crop of outstanding superintendents. For
                    superintendents as well as for teachers, there were more openings than there were <list type="footnotes">

                    time for superintendents and teachers because of promotions and new worthwhile work that needed to
                    be done.</p>
            <p>The first State Superintendent of Public Instruction in Indiana took office in October, 1852. Anyone
                    who is chosen to the office must become a candidate on a party ticket and submit to a popular
                    election. The term is one of two years, and to continue longer requires an additional nomination and
                    election for each term served. Nevertheless, quite a few able men have sought and obtained the
                    position. The second educator to fill the office was no other than Caleb Mills who was elected in
                    1854 and served but one term. Ten years later George W. Hoss was elected. Beginning with his term,
                    the office was filled for a period of eighteen consecutive years by a series of unusual men,
                    Professor Hoss being followed in succession by Barnabas C. Hobbs, Milton B. Hopkins, James H. Smart,
                    and John M. Bloss.</p>
            <p>Professor Hoss was re-elected but resigned before the end of his second term to become professor of
                    English literature at Indiana University. During the remainder of his career he vibrated between

                    University as professor of English literature. In 1880 he again went to <placeName>

                    Superintendent in October, 1868. In this office, he performed with rare intelligence. He did his

                        <region type="county">Washington County</region>

                    </placeName> College, though he did not receive a degree because he omitted some required subjects.
                    After a varied experience as a teacher, he became principal of the Bloomingdale Academy in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Parke County</region>

                    except for very brief intervals, he was a trustee for the remainder of his life. The Normal School
                    and Bloomingdale Academy were institutions in whose welfare he was deeply interested. He was an able
                    educator who was but fifty-six years of age when he retired from the State Superintendent's
                    office. It was unfortunate that he was not called to some post that would have required the use of
                    his high talents at that time. In regard to his services as State Superintendent, he said after
                    quitting the office: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    but he did not falter. His salutatory message from which the following passage is taken was

                    of the growing city of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. He was a restless, determined man who gave lectures far and wide in the cause
                    of education while devoting ten years of his life to the upbuilding of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> schools. Only two cities in the state could boast more children of school age, and this
                    situation made Superintendent Smart a member of the State Board of Education. When he became State
                    Superintendent in 1875, at thirty-four years of age, he was a well-known, active educational leader
                    with much influence.</p>
            <p>So many things were already under way in the building of Indiana's free, public school
                    system that the conditions prevailing from 1875 to 1881 greatly favored the work of James H. Smart.
                    By just swimming with the current, he would have been sure to receive much credit for the progress
                    that was being made. He was not a man to be satisfied with such a course and found new work to
                    perform. His efforts in connection with the state's educational exhibit prepared for the
                    Centennial Exposition at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1876 did much to elevate lowly Indiana to a higher place in the estimation of
                    thoughtful people everywhere. As to what had been accomplished, he was by no means satisfied. In
                    1880 he boldly pointed out defects in the new educational system and the legislation under which it
                    was operating. He stressed the serious defects, called attention to some that were less serious and
                    recommended a few important modifications. A few of the changes that were urgently needed could be
                    made by the legislature and others by changes in the administrative machinery. Only one, that
                    relative to lengthening the term of the State Superintendent, required a constitutional amendment.
                    Sadly enough, two defects that he emphasized, the choice of the State Superintendent every two years
                    in a party contest and the selection of county superintendents by township trustees have not yet
                    been remedied.</p>
            <p>Before the close of his third term, Mr. Smart was made president of the National Educational
                    Association, which gave him a chance to win further renown. He then became, for a brief period, a
                    representative of a company that published textbooks, a fate that awaited every successful educator
                    without a job. It was not long until the greatest opportunity of his life came to him when he was
                    made president of Purdue University in 1883. As head of this institution, <pb n="120" id="VAA4025-041-2-018"/> for seventeen years, he was to perform a great work which alone was

                    captain. He left the service after the fall of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName> because of ill health. He returned to college for a while and then began to teach again
                    in his home community. His success caused him to be chosen as principal of the Orleans Academy,
                    where he served from 1866 to 1870. He then became principal of the Female Academy of <placeName>

                    remained until he became State Superintendent. Two years was but a short time in which to accomplish
                    big things, but there was no recession in the high standards set by his predecessors while John M.
                    Bloss was in, charge. As president of the State Board of Education, member of the board of trustees
                    of the State Normal School, and director of the new and vastly enlarged public school system of the
                    state, he labored incessantly and efficiently. Soon after he retired from the office of State
                    Superintendent, he became superintendent of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>

                    the State Superintendent was continued as its president and the Governor remained a member, but
                    their associates were now to be the president of Indiana University, the president of the State
                    Normal School and the superintendents of the cities of the state ranking first, second, and third in
                    regard to the number of school children enumerated. In 1875 the president of Purdue University was
                    added to the membership, and no further changes were made in the composition of the Board until
                    1899. As constituted after the reorganization of 1865, the Board always included able educators and
                    exerted a real influence.</p>
            <p>By a law of 1873, the office of county superintendent was created. For many years before this, the
                    state had been experimenting with county examiners, for a time three in each county and then one.
                    The new legislation added some duties to those exercised by the county examiner and changed the
                    title. The choice of county superintendent was placed in the hands of the township trustees of each
                    county, a method of selection that still prevails. Because of the great and increasing number of
                    public schools in the seventies, the office of county superintendent at once became important. The
                    able state superintendents of the period when the public school system was being created had much to
                    do with the placing of great potential influence in the hands of county superintendents. This was
                    because these local school officials were the natural agents through whom state policies might be
                    carried out. A great deal depends on the man who fills the office today, as well as in all the years
                    since free, public schools became universal in Indiana, as to how valuable or influential the office
                    of county superintendent may be.</p>
            <p>The State Teachers' Association organized in 1854, became very powerful as a stimulating and
                    guiding influence in the years of the great awakening. The Association grew slowly as larger numbers
                    of the rank and file took on the habit of attending its annual meetings. Through its officers and
                    committees, the organization promoted worthy projects such as teacher training, a reading circle for
                    teachers, a reading circle for young people, and township, county, and <pb n="122" id="VAA4025-041-2-020"/> regional institutes.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> The annual meetings of the
                    Association held in December in <placeName>

                    other and placed them before a wider public. Papers dealing with current school problems were
                    prepared and read before the different sessions. These were often discussed and many of them were
                    published in the <hi rend="i">Indiana School Journal</hi> or in similar educational organs. In 1890
                    the membership of the Association was reported as 381, which was small for an organization started
                    in 1854 with 172 members. Reports indicate that the attendance was generally about twice the
                    membership from 1870 to 1890, from which it may be inferred that the payment of annual dues was
                        voluntary.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>Institutes became such a prominent and universal feature of the business of teaching in the period
                    following the Civil War that they deserve more than passing mention. They developed as a quick way
                    to reach and help teachers who were in dire need. Year after year multitudes of teachers were added
                    to the ranks most of whom possessed a very inadequate knowledge of the subjects to be taught, and
                    knew less if possible about how to teach or how to organize and discipline a school. Conscientious
                    educational leaders were so deeply stirred by the sad situation that they resorted to short cuts
                    from necessity. In addition to private normal schools, normal colleges, and normal universities,
                    county institutes, state, or regional institutes, county normals, or normal institutes and township
                    institutes were developed some of which remained a conspicuous part of the picture for many years. A
                    state institute, promoted by the State Teachers' Association, was conducted at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Knightstown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in the summer of 1865. This famous institute was written up fully in the <hi rend="i">Indiana School Journal</hi> under the title, "Indiana State Normal
                    School." It was directed by John M. Olcott, the chairman of a committee of the State
                    Association. It <list type="footnotes">

                            People's Reading Circle of Indiana was not organized until 1889, but it was
                            affecting the lives of ten thousand children by the end of its first year.</item>

                    once or twice to give tone and variety to the mighty effort at improvement. It is hard to see how
                    more uplift could have been crowded into four weeks.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Another state institute,
                    referred to as a "normal institute" and never as a summer session, was held in the
                    new State Normal building and conducted mainly by the president and faculty of the new institution
                    during the summer of 1870. The attendance ran to one hundred and fifty and was marked by the absence
                    of regular students of the Normal School. The program was similar to that put on at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Knightstown</settlement>
                    </placeName> five years earlier, though there were very few lectures by outsiders.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> In the same period, there were in other years, some regional institutes with similar
                    programs, held in three or four centers scattered over the state. In all, there were few institutes
                    of this description.</p>
            <p>In the eighties and nineties there were many county normals, or review terms. These usually ran for
                    six or eight weeks, and were conducted by local teachers, who had been away at school for longer or
                    shorter periods and who felt an urge to aid young teachers to get started and old ones to keep
                    going, while obtaining for themselves some summer income. Usually there were two instructors who
                    could generally count on the friendship and support of the county superintendent. The desire for a
                    first license or the need to obtain a new one to replace one that had expired, or was about to
                    expire, inspired many of those who enrolled. No credits were sought or given and examinations were
                    rare. The work done in such summer normals did stimulate many of the younger attendants to go to the
                    State Normal School, to some college, or to Indiana University.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                    added work in music. At least one instructor lectured in the field of pedagogy, the other in some
                    other field. If the other line of work was in history, literature, or some other academic subject,
                    the lecturer might present either methods of teaching the subject or deal with content. From the
                    early period of county institutes in Indiana, lecturers were anxious to come from other states and
                    many institute instructors from the outside came to be well known to Indiana teachers. Among the
                    institute instructors, whether from within the state or from afar, there were inspiring lecturers,
                    scholars who aroused great interest in their subjects, and superficial entertainers.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Township institutes were conducted cooperatively by the teachers of townships in which
                    they were held. They could be good, poor, or indifferent according to circumstances. Outlines were
                    prepared for the entire state and distributed to the teachers of each township through the county
                    superintendents. After some years, each teacher drew an extra day's wage each month for
                    attending his township institute. In the final stage of the township institutes, extension courses
                    were taken for credit, the instructors being furnished by the extension divisions of institutions
                    maintaining extension work.</p>
            <p>The system of licensing teachers through examinations, the lists of questions being prepared by, or
                    on the responsibility of, the State Board of Education and distributed to county superintendents
                    from the office of the State Superintendent, reached its highest perfection between 1870 and 1890.
                    This check on the qualifications of teachers, so fully relied on in the period of the establishment
                    of the free, public school system continued with little change until gradually abolished by the
                    teacher training laws passed from 1907 to 1921. Anyone now living who became a teacher in Indiana
                    without a State Normal diploma before 1907 will remember the examinations that had to be passed.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>Very few indeed of the youth of Indiana went to college before 1870. More but not many received a
                    high school education or the equivalent before that year. Those who did, for the most part, attended
                    seminaries or academies. Fortunate were those who were too poor to go away from the home community
                    for secondary education, if they lived near an academy or seminary. For the ambitious young men who
                    attended such schools as the Bloomingdale Academy or the Seminary at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for example, before the coming of the new day, it meant something like going to
                    college in later times. Many a man was able to educate himself by virtue of what he learned in an
                    academy in the way of basic knowledge and habits of study formed. If he developed there a thirst for
                    learning and a tendency to add constantly to his store, he could go far and a large proportion of
                    such young men did do just that. The sad part was that so few could avail themselves of such
                    opportunities. At the same time, vast numbers of younger children received little or no schooling.
                    That the situation was desperate in Indiana for more than a generation after statehood cannot be
                    denied. Neither can it be denied that the reason was that free public schools could only be provided
                    by taxes levied on property. The truth is that it took a long time to convince the owners of
                    property that they must through the payment of taxes levied on their property furnish most of the
                    funds necessary to establish and maintain a system of public schools for all. This fact explains why
                    the court decisions of 1854 and 1857 were regarded as such appalling calamities by those who had
                    felt that victory was at last in their hands. It is because local school taxes were absolutely
                    necessary that the law of 1867 stands out as a shining landmark in the history of education in

            <p>Having finally removed the great barrier to educational progress in 1867, the work of establishing
                    the vast, free public school system was performed with incredible rapidity. An intelligent and

                        <p>The age is one of marked educational enterprise. Never before has so much attention been
                            given to schools. All things are being moved to bring up educational matters to the highest

            <p>This general statement of what had happened by 1876 is correct. But the creative work went on and one
                    can truly affirm that whereas only a bare start had been made in 1870, the structure was complete by
                    1890 with a school-house in every community of the state and a teacher in charge of each. Elementary
                    education was open to all. It is true that opportunities to go to high school were not yet open to
                    boys and girls of rural areas, but extended high school facilities, consolidated schools,
                    transportation of grade and high school pupils and various other things that are now common were but
                    features to be added. The basic system stood as a <hi rend="i">fait accompli</hi> in 1890.</p>
            <p>A study of enrollments brings out the fact that increasing multitudes entered the elementary schools
                    at once. These were located right in the communities where the pupils lived. Next came the high
                    schools of the cities and incorporated towns, though some years had to elapse before many families
                    fell into the habit of sending their children to high school even when it was much easier for them
                    to attend than it was for country children to walk to and from the district schools morning and
                    evening. College enrollments went up from 1870 to 1880 and increased more rapidly from 1880 to 1890,
                    but much greater expansion came after 1890.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> To <list type="footnotes">

                            the phenomenon attracted attention. Josh Billings (Henry Wheeler Shaw) took note of the new
                            tendency, and, pretending that it might be as dangerous as many citizens believed it to be,
                            offered this bit of advice to all young men: "Git schoolin' and cloas

                    expense and payments for board and room. These were often deterrent factors—more often
                    prohibitive. Furthermore, the acceptance of the idea that young men and women should go to college
                    was naturally harder for most people than it was to get used to high school attendance. In the
                    course of a few years, however, with the rapid growth of elementary schools and high schools, it was
                    bound to become natural for more and more high school graduates to go to college. In other words,
                    until the age of free, common schools and high schools, colleges could not grow greatly in respect
                    to the numbers of students.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In regard to teachers, the phenomenal development of the public schools from 1870 to 1890 quickly
                    affected their attendance at higher institutions. Though not required by law for many years, to
                    prepare themselves for their work, many teachers felt the urge to extend their education. Old and
                    young, they were apt to go to school, if only for a short time, in the period of the great
                    awakening. They went to the Indiana State Normal School, to the many private normal schools, to city
                    teacher training departments, to colleges, to Indiana University and to Purdue University. The idea
                    behind the establishment of the State Normal School was that teachers should be taught not only the
                    content of subjects but given training in psychology and methods with the chance to observe and
                    practice in model schools. There was no legislation, however, to determine where teachers should be
                    educated, and they distributed themselves to all of the higher institutions and were received. City
                    superintendents urged teachers to acquire further training and so did most county superintendents.
                    The natural desire to obtain a better education was also a force, and the fact that promotions were
                    more apt to come to those who prepared for them was another.</p>
            <p>The attendance at college while much higher by 1890 than earlier, does not, as already intimated,
                    seem large when compared with that of the years between World War I and World War II. Enrollments
                    for the year ending in June, 1890, in the three state institutions will illustrate this point:

                     <hi rend="sup">33</hi> As economic conditions improved, it was easier for families to send
                            their children to college, but until the notion that college education was desirable was
                            accepted, numerous families with means did not consider sending their sons or daughters to
                            college.</item>

                    students, whose numbers were great enough to prove that high school education was not yet very
                    popular. The total for Indiana University includes 99 preparatory students and for Purdue University
                    111. Because the Normal School was still obliged to train mainly teachers for the common schools,
                    the number of high school graduates among the student body, though increasing year by year, was but
                    129 for the year 1889-1890. Since the spring quarter attendance at the Normal School was much
                    greater than that for other quarters, while the attendance was more steady through the year at the
                    two universities, it should be stated that the average for the year at the Normal School was 463,
                    including students who were not high school graduates.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Of the state supported

                    school which was started just at the beginning of the mighty movement creating the public school
                    system of the state. In fact, it simply could not avoid expansion under the conditions that
                    accompanied its first twenty years. It was caught in the current of the time and favored by it much
                    as were city and state superintendents.</p>
            <p>The characteristics of the superintendents of that day have been described and the leading facts
                    pertaining to the careers of several of them have been presented. The first president of the State
                    Normal School was William A. Jones who left a great impress on the institution and on the schools of
                    Indiana. He was a student of philosophy, an advocate of thorough work, and a powerful advocate of
                    teacher training. He was followed by George P. Brown who was well known for his work as
                    superintendent of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    1885 when William W. Parsons, a member of the graduating class of 1872, the first class in the
                    history of the school, succeeded him. This alumnus, a disciple of William A. Jones and a forceful

            <p>The first president of Purdue University, if Professor Richard Owen of Indiana University who never
                    became active is not counted, was Abraham C. Shortridge. Having distinguished himself as

                    1878. He was succeeded by Emerson E. White, who remained until 1883. President White had been State
                    Superintendent of Public Instruction in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    </placeName>. The next president of Purdue was James H. Smart whose third term as State
                    Superintendent had closed in March, 1881. He remained president for seventeen years, a period of
                    tremendous importance in the history of the young and developing institution. Because of the unusual
                    forward movement in public education, in which President Smart had taken a leading part, he was able
                    to so direct the affairs of Purdue University that the great progress possible under the many
                    favoring conditions could be achieved.</p>
            <p>The man of the hour at Indiana University was David Starr Jordan. He was not found among the able
                    city superintendents of the time, nor had he gained prominence as a State Superintendent or fame as
                    a minister of the gospel before he turned educator. A graduate student in biology, he came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to teach in the high school during 1874-1875, a colleague being William W. Parsons. The
                    next year, he became a professor at Northwestern Christian University (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> University), where he remained for four years. He kept up his research during summers
                    and while teaching, but found time to try for positions in several universities without success. In
                    1879 he became a professor at Indiana University, succeeding Richard Owen. He not only carried his
                    classes but kept himself extremely busy doing research and field work. He believed in himself and
                    fully expected to accomplish big things as a student whose ability and promise had been recognized
                    by Louis Agassiz and Andrew D. White. After six years at Indiana, he was to his complete surprise
                    chosen to succeed the Reverend Lemmel Moss, D.D., as president. He served from 1885 to 1891, six
                    years of great significance in his life and that of the University. He <pb n="130" id="VAA4025-041-2-028"/> was not only a scholar in an academic field instead of a
                    philosopher-administrator or theologian-educator, but he was a man devoted to science and scientific
                    methods. The spirit of science was to pervade higher institutions of learning in America and exert
                    great influence in education generally. It was a great day for Indiana when <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> became president of Indiana University. By liberalizing the course of study, bringing
                    to the faculty young men of promise and linking up the fortunes of the institution with those of the
                    people of the state, he opened doors that were waiting and ready to swing wide. He did not remain
                    long but he left a great deal of his spirit behind when he went to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>

            </p>
            <p>Truly a great chapter in the educational history of Indiana was written between 1870 and 1890. It was
                    not a revival, as some have classed it, but a great awakening. It produced strong leaders, but in
                    turn it furnished the conditions that made for their success. It was a movement well supported by
                    the masses and they profited by it. Surely any Hoosier who lived through that period and who became
                    interested in education must have experienced a profound satisfaction in looking backward over that
                    score of years, and likewise have felt a thrill of anticipation when he cast his eyes towards the
                    future. Should it be too much to hope, that having once responded so fully to her deep
                    responsibility and splendid opportunity, Indiana may again, relying less completely on the virtue of
                    conservatism, experience a new awakening and move more swiftly towards a better day.</p>

            <p>German immigration of the nineteenth century may be divided into three periods. The first period
                    would include all those who came before 1848 and who were frequently referred to as the
                    "Grays." This period attracted many peasants and laborers who were accustomed to
                    hard work and who did not possess a high standard of living. Some of the better educated who came
                    during this time, in spite of hard work, did not achieve success. Gustav Körner, who came
                    to America in 1833, was an outstanding leader of the "Grays" and was
                    contemptuously referred to as "der graue Gustav." The second period, from 1848 to
                    1865, attracted mostly merchants, manufacturers, and professional people who were better-known as
                    the "Greens" or "Forty-eighters." This group was very
                    influential in the political and cultural development of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The most outstanding German-American of this period was Carl Schurz. Many of these

                    because of insufficient funds to defray the cost of the voyage to America. In 1818 the emigration

                            seen grapevines, whose trunks, over a foot in diameter, rose straight up for more than a
                            hundred feet and then spread their densely foliaged vines over the tops of elms.</p>

                    not a constant visitor to the cabin of the settler, and that no one was obliged to serve as a

                        its value, and the rate is not the same each year; usually it is sixty or sixty-two cents on the

            <p>Some were interested in emigrating because they were compelled to work beneath their station in life
                    and some would rather starve than to engage in work which their associates regarded as disgraceful.
                    In America no one needed to be ashamed of honest work. A carpenter who had difficulty in finding
                    employment at his trade emigrated to the <placeName>

                    developed in his trade. Sometimes German army officers had to resign commissions because they were
                    unable to pay a gambling debt or for some other reason. They might emigrate to America and there
                    achieve success by herding cattle in <placeName>

            <p>The father of a family frequently felt it was his duty to lift his children to a position of security
                    and happiness. He wanted to free them from the thought of spending their last years in a poorhouse
                    or having to depend upon charity. If he emigrated to America, he felt that he might have an

                    conversed in German with them. Elias P. Ford-ham, when he visited the colony in 1818, made
                    particular mention of the fact that German was spoken, that the people were orderly, the town neat,
                    and that some of the members of the colony were excellent musicians. Thomas Hulme's Journal

            <p>In the fall of 1849 Adolf Brandeis wrote a letter to his wife in which he mentioned in some detail
                    the life of a Catholic German village sixty-five miles cross country from <placeName>

                    </placeName> before 1849. Although somewhat exaggerated, it tells us something about this German
                    settlement. Several paragraphs from the letter follow: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Now let me tell you something about my life here, I am in a part of the country inhabited,
                            for a distance of about 60 to 80 miles, exclusively by Germans and since I left the
                            steamboat I have not heard a single word of English.</p>
                        <p>The place I am describing is a completely Catholic German village protected and governed by
                            the church that crowns the hilltop. In the evenings the men come into the village bars of
                            which there are three, to drink and talk. They cast lots or play domino to decide who is to
                            pay the reckoning for the beer; and as I always take part in the game and pay, and then
                            leave my beer, I have made many good friends.</p>
                        <p>But one of the main features of German life is lacking here and that is music. Moreover, I
                            have as yet seen few women, so that the whole reduces itself more or less to an improved

            <p>A further analysis of the naturalization records shows that during the period from 1853 to 1869, May,
                    June, October, and November were the favored months to make the voyage to America, whereas between
                    1869 and 1910, May, September, and October were chosen to make the journey to the new homeland.
                    While some months were more favorable for the voyage across the ocean, a number of emigrants
                    apparently took advantage of the opportunity to sail to America when the occasion presented itself
                    regardless of the season of the year, and so there was some emigration every month of the year.</p>

                    of 1873, which began with the so-called "Black Friday," emigration began to

                    </placeName>. The railroads had perfected their organization for opening the Western states, and the
                    steamship companies as well as railroads sent emigration agents to Europe. Since transportation
                    rates were low, even the poor people could take advantage of the opportunity to emigrate to
                        America.<hi rend="sup">72</hi> Because there was a large exodus, and the German colonial and

                    policy of Bismarck kept many wavering. The Prussian Government had adopted new measures to colonize
                    at home. The Eastern provinces of Prussia and Posen showed the highest number of emigrants, the
                    lowest degree of industry, and the worst farming conditions, although the soil was very fertile.
                    Upon investigation, it was discovered that it was impossible for the sons of German farmers to
                    become independent and own their homestead and farm because of the large manorial estates. The
                    people who were an asset emigrated and the less desirable class remained. The government, therefore,
                    purchased large estates and divided them. This made it possible for the small farmer to own his own

            <p>It may be assumed that the decline on this side of the ocean during the last ten years of the
                    nineteenth century may be attributed to the financial depression of 1893, the dissatisfaction and
                    depression in the West, as well as the reduction of desirable public lands.<hi rend="sup">75</hi>

            <p>It is apparent, therefore, that when the workshops, shipyards, and factories in America were
                    operating to capacity, and when good crops and remunerative prices enabled the American farmer to
                    enjoy the luxuries of life, the emigration from <placeName>

                    emigration invariably declined. The bad condition of the labor market in America had a direct effect
                    on emigration in that fewer prepaid tickets were sent to friends in <placeName>

                    to avail themselves of the larger markets, others lying between or beyond these transverse routes
                    found the existing railroads inaccessible as well as inconvenient for profitable marketing of their

                    secure subscriptions sufficient to prepare the road for iron and then issue stock on the roadbed in

            <p>Little doubt exists but that the merger was effected for the express purpose of securing land-grant
                    aid for the construction of the proposed railroad. By 1856 the intense sectional opposition to
                    railroad land grants had abated somewhat. This was due to several reasons. By this time the growing
                    West had sufficient power in Congress, especially in the Senate, to secure governmental aid for
                    internal improvements. Then too, Eastern capitalists were interested in railroad projects and
                    exerted considerable pressure on the Eastern congressmen for the furtherance of railroad building.
                    This led to a coalition of the West and the East in opposition to the South.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>The terms of the Congressional act provided that every odd numbered section of land within six miles
                    of the line of the road should be granted to the state for the construction of the specified
                    railroad. In case sufficient lands were not available within these limits, other odd numbered
                    sections might be selected as distant as fifteen miles from the line of the road. Further, it was
                    provided that the lands should be disposed of by the state in portions of 120 sections, and that
                    upon the governor's certification to the Secretary of Interior "that any twenty
                    continuous miles [of railroad] is completed, … another quantity not to exceed 120
                    sections may be sold. …" Still further, it provided that failure of any company
                    to complete its project within ten years would constitute forfeiture of the grant.</p>

                    Competition was keen and bitter at the capital, and for a time it looked as if the Grand Rapids and

            <p>Although the officials and friends of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Company had labored earnestly and
                    furiously for the bestowal of the land grant, they soon discovered that it was not a panacea for all
                    ills. The most serious obstacle at the moment was a depleted treasury. Poor harvests and the current
                    monetary panic made its immediate replenishment unlikely. This would interfere with the original

                    </placeName> to Grand Rapids, by local subscription. The state's decision that none of the
                    grant was to be patented to the company until after the completion of twenty continuous miles of
                    railroad was an unexpected and stupefying blow, for the intention had been to utilize the first one

                    often it was unpaid. By 1859, 463,271 acres of the grant land, with an estimated value of

                    statistical reports of all kinds were consulted. They stated that the cost would average
                    $17,500 per mile, with the division between <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> and Kendallville being most expensive because of the lack of gravel near the right of
                    way. They believed, however, that the entire 350 miles of road offered no engineering difficulties
                    because of the uniform surface, good drainage, and easy approaches to the streams. It was advised
                    that the twenty miles from Grand Rapids to Cedar Springs be built first in order to receive one
                    hundred twenty sections of the land grant, and then that the road from Grand Rapids to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kalamazoo</settlement>
                    </placeName> be built so as to gain access to east and west traffic. It was thought the earnings
                    from this could be applied on another section. Since the 182.5 miles north of Grand Rapids were
                    secured by the grant, some attention was given to the characteristics of this land. It was said to
                    be a forest region of isolated settlements, but having a climate superior to any neighboring state.
                    Here a plumper wheat of heavy yield was produced. Here, due to the uniform winter temperatures,
                    rarely under 15°F. below zero, root crops could remain in the ground all winter and
                    reseed the fields the next year. It was stated that 80,000,000 feet of lumber were cut on the
                    Muskegon River annually and floated to market at a loss, whereas a railroad which would furnish more
                    satisfactory transportation would encourage the establishment of lumber camps and sawmills. Thus a
                    lucrative business in lumber and necessities for the camps and mills would result. Since the
                    government lands were fast disappearing from market, the railroad company was urged to get its lands
                    on the market as speedily as possible and to choose those lying nearest <geogName>Lake
                    Michigan</geogName>. In conclusion, it was believed the completion of the road was merely a matter
                    of manpower and money, and these gentlemen saw no reason why it could not be completed in two and a
                    half years, under wise financial management.</p>

            <p>The war gave railroad building a temporary setback. Railroad iron was very expensive, if obtainable.
                    Labor too, was scarce and high. Money was not plentiful. During this period Hugh McAfee, a <placeName>

                    miles north of Grand Rapids.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> As neither company was able to inject much
                    capital into the work, and financial aid from the railroad company was uncertain and intermittent,
                    little was accomplished.</p>
            <p>In 1864, realizing that the time limit on the land grant was practically at on end, the officials of
                    the road bestirred themselves sufficiently to ask for an extension of time. At the same time certain
                    men in Indiana, especially at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, LaGrange, and Lima (Howe), who were interested in the road besought the fortieth

                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>. Such a bill was introduced in Congress by Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana and was
                    passed, but a provision of the act was refusal to extend the time limit.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> This
                    act provided that the grant should be extended to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> if any surplus of the grant lands remained after the original line north of Grand
                    Rapids was completed. It further provided that sixty sections of land should be patented upon the
                    completion of each ten continuous miles of railroad, and that this land should lie within twenty
                    miles of the line of the road.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> The next year, 1865, Congress granted an

            <p>During 1865, 1866, and 1867, interest in the road reached such a low ebb that there was insufficient

            <p>President Edgerton found his position a difficult one. The company had no credit.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> It was encumbered with more than $300,000 capital stock, most of which was held
                    by a few persons and which represented no value put into the road. A floating debt of
                    $500,000 was outstanding, and a former president claimed to hold $270,000 of
                    the company's bonds as security on $20,000-$25,000 due him. The bond
                    situation was deplorable. Bonds issued January 1, 1860, had netted the company less than twenty-five
                    cents on the dollar. In addition, an unwarranted bond issue made by a <placeName>

                    Unfortunately, it was impossible to get the directors and stockholders to agree to recall both of
                    these and make a new bond issue. Many persons, believing that the road would never be built, did not
                    pay their subscriptions. Towns and townships refused to make their bonds available for such an
                    uncertain project. Deeds and records for grounds and right of way were lost or destroyed, and

                    legislature. The matter was referred to the Railroad and Judiciary Committee, which held a hearing.
                    This committee reported that 2,336 persons had asked for a transfer of the land grant and 3,375 had
                    protested against any legislation unfriendly to the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad Company.
                    Further, it asked for legislation: (1) to confirm lands to the company for the road already built;
                    (2) to provide for construction of twenty miles north of Cedar Springs by July 1, 1869, and the
                    completion of an additional twenty miles north by January 1, 1871; (3) to provide for completion of
                    at least twenty consecutive miles yearly thereafter; (4) to provide that with failure to comply with
                    clauses (1) and (2) the undisposed lands should be granted to another company.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>

            <p>The officials of the road were stunned by the provision that the twenty miles north of Cedar Springs
                    must be finished by July 1, 1869. No work had been done on that section, which was an unbroken
                    forest. Snow lay on the gound until late, and water from the spring thaw drained away slowly. A
                    smallpox epidemic in Cedar Springs was a further hindrance. It was necessary to engage laborers,
                    collect materials, and arrange finances immediately. For months 4,500 gross tons of English rails,

                    prosperous houses of her merchants on the sloping terraces. Vagabonds loafed on her docks and told
                    their tall stories of men and cities. Settlers from the wooded regions to the east and from the
                    fertile rolling lands to the north brought their produce to the waterfront in lumbering wagons and
                    oxcarts and carried away life's necessities in trade. Manufactured goods from the East
                    included luxuries as well as domestic commodities; metropolitan fashions changed with every passing
                    boat. It was an era of prosperity and general well-being along the river, but the breath of change
                    was in the air. The slavery question was creating strong regional prejudices.</p>

                    participated in the Mexican War as captain of Company I of the Sixteenth Regiment of Indiana
                    Infantry.</p>
            <p>Thomas Floyd Bethell, one of Indiana's pioneer sons, was born at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">French Lick</settlement>
                    </placeName>, August 3, 1816. He was the eldest son of Cloud and Rachel Floyd Bethell and a direct
                    descendant of Samson Bethell, the first of the Bethells who had settled in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> some time before the Revolution, where he had married Mary Cantrell in 1762.</p>
            <p>The events leading up to the migration of the Bethells to Indiana in the year 1815 are not without
                    historical significance. Mrs. Warren learned of these from Rachel Floyd Bethell, her grandmother,
                    who was a member of her son's household until her death in 1874.</p>
            <p>Rachel Floyd was the seventh child of Caleb and Nancy Mainard Floyd of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. Caleb was a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName>, though his wife Nancy, having inherited the Mainard plantation, was a slaveholder in
                    her own right. At his wife's death, Caleb Floyd gave the slaves their freedom, but none of
                    them would leave the plantation where they had known only kindness and security.</p>
            <p>Rachel was a favorite of her father and had inherited his liberty-loving principles. When she met
                    young Cloud Bethell, he was in uniform, a soldier of the War of 1812, but he confessed that he was
                    preparing himself for the Baptist ministry. Their courtship was uninterrupted, and in the summer of
                    1815 they were married. Having decided to establish their home on free soil, they set out on their
                    wedding day for the Indiana wilderness. They were prepared for an arduous journey and took with them
                    no more than they could carry in their saddle bags. At the last moment, the bride's negro
                    mammy begged to go with the young couple and was finally given consent. She loaded her saddle horse
                    with a featherbed, which was weighted at opposite corners with smoothing irons. When questioned
                    about her odd pack, the old woman vowed that her mistress would never sleep on corn shucks nor go
                    about her daily tasks in unironed clothing as long as the Lord spared her as a servant.</p>
            <p>The smoothing irons never grew cold on that Indiana frontier, Rachel related of those first hard
                    years. When <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-041-2-067"/> they were not in use in her own household, they
                    were being loaned to neighbors. They were the first smoothing irons in the little settlement of
                    French Lick, where she and Cloud Bethell had decided to locate.</p>
            <p>It was in this rude <placeName>

                    There were six boys besides Thomas: Jonathan, who died in youth, <placeName>

               </placeName>, Union, Tilman, and
                    Frank, as well as a daughter, Eliza. And "Miss Rachel's" faithful servant
                    was with her beloved mistress at the birth of all her children.</p>
            <p>Cloud Bethell died in 1843, and his son Thomas took his place as head of the family. The
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> beckoned to him, and he realized that it offered more
                    opportunities for the family of boys than the landlocked region of their <placeName>

            <p>After Thomas Bethell had located his mother and her family in a comfortable house overlooking the
                    river, he was off to the Mexican War. He was thirty years of age. At twenty-four he had been

                    and gunpowder tea.</p>
            <p>By 1855 Thomas Bethell was able to begin building his own home. A contractor was engaged in the East,
                    and he brought his own workmen. A few of these men were skilled artisans, and their families came
                    with them to live in New-burgh. Some of them remained to become citizens of the village. The house
                    took shape under the experienced hand of unhurried labor. Its architectural pattern was English, for
                    Maria Bethell had her homesick moments for the English landscapes, but the quiet elegance of
                    American Colonial was there, too.</p>
            <p>The bricks were brought up from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the flats that carried down pork, hominy, beeswax, and feathers. Gulf sand was
                    transported for the cement, and today it is as firm as the day it set; none of the brickwork ever
                    needed repointing.</p>
            <p>The house sits on the slope fronting the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    dozen years before. It commands a beautiful view of the river as its curves down to <placeName>

                    keeps the tradition of Colonial dignity. Since Colonel Bethell's day, the twelve large
                    rooms have not been changed very much. Most of the interior decorations are the same—the
                    original paint, some of the wallpaper, and practically all of the furnishings. Cupboards of old
                    glass and china, highboys and gargantuan poster beds; bookcases, crammed with leather-bound volumes
                    of <hi rend="i">Harper's Monthly, Scribner's, Peterson's</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Godey's Lady Book;</hi> books, pictures, and bric-a-brac, they all speak of an
                    era that has become history.</p>
            <p>Eliza Bethell was seven when the house was finished. It had taken three years to build it. She has no
                    recollection of moving into the new house from Grandmother Rachel Floyd's, but she does
                    recall falling into one of the wells that was being dug for setting out cypress trees. Thirteen of
                    these fine old trees still stand on the grounds. The ivy that creeps on the house was brought over
                    from Westminster Abbey in a wicker basket and planted there by Thomas Gifford, her mother's
                    brother.</p>
            <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-041-2-071"/>
            <p>One of her earliest recollections was a small incident connected with her Uncle Union
                    Bethell's wedding. Uncle Union was marrying Eva Parrett.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> The bride was
                    being dressed in Rachel Floyd's upstairs bedroom, and the bridesmaids were with her
                    exclaiming over the beautiful gown while covertly stealing glimpses of their own finery in the
                    bride's mirror.</p>
            <p>Little Eliza was playing under the window outside, trying to catch a glimpse of the pretty bride, who
                    was going to be her aunt, when a shrill burst of laughter made her look up to the room above. A
                    small china doll came sailing down through the tree of heaven, and fell unharmed at her feet. She
                    picked it up, examined it fearfully, and ran to her mother. "Look, mother, it came down
                    through the God tree," she cried. Mrs. Bethell laughed, "It's
                    Eva's doll," she said. "Her bridesmaids were teasing her when they found
                    she was carrying her doll in her pocket on her wedding day, and she tossed it out of a window to
                    escape them."</p>
            <p>Grandmother Rachel Floyd came to live in the big house with Thomas' family, now that her own
                    family had all left the nest to seek fortunes of their own. <placeName>

                    doctor, named Eli Lewis. It was in the Lewis home later that young Eliza saw the deer, dressed, and
                    hanging in the corner of the big open fireplace, where it was being cured by the smoke. Deer was not
                    uncommon in the woods around <placeName>

            <p>Eliza and her sister Alice, who was two years her senior, found much to interest them in the village.
                    There was the blindman's store, patronized by all the children of <placeName>

                    patience of the afflicted. The interior of the shop was interesting too. Books and stationery, an
                    assortment of notions, dolls and toys, and, last but not least, candies in tall glass jars that made
                    an imposing array on the lower shelves. The store was on the street level below A. M.

                    village draymen, but he made a tidy sum on the side selling vanilla ice cream. One could eat a dish
                    of it in his "parlor," or bring a pail to purchase a family portion. There was
                    always something thrilling about hurrying home with a tin of the delectable sweet before it melted
                    away like the Snow Image in the <hi rend="i">Common Second Reader.</hi> Joe's factory was
                    located on Market Street facing the river.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Warren recalls the many boats on the river in those days, and the interest they created for all
                    the villagers. Though <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> was in her heyday then, few people were blasé enough to feign indifference
                    when the big boats came down and tied up at the wharf. They were a tangible link to the world of
                    wealth and fashion. The children made it a game to call them by name while they were at a distance,
                    and, as was natural, they all had favorites. <hi rend="i">Grey Eagle</hi> and <hi rend="i">Little
                        Grey Eagle</hi> are two that she remembers particularly.</p>
            <p>Besides the steamboats and tugs, there were still many flatboats carrying freight and livestock.
                    There were still a few broadhorns, or trading boats of this type, fitted with counters and shelves
                    like a store. They made the smaller wharves, or the straggling settlements on the tributary rivers,
                    carrying such necessities as bar iron, nails, cards (for combing wool), hemp cord, gunpowder,
                    saltpeter, sugar, tea, and country linen. Most of them carried queensware and glass.</p>
            <p>Some of these floating stores were known as "glass boats," because their principal
                    merchandise came from the glassworks at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Wheeling, and, as a rule, they flew a calico flag, and announced their coming by a
                    shrill blast of a tin horn.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Warren recalls an early adventure on one of the "glass boats." It was well
                    known among the young of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> that the "glass boat" paid well for rags, papers, and old bottles.
                    She and Alice were eagerly awaiting its arrival, for they had collected a small stock of these
                    wanted items. Without bothering to consult their mother, who might have had a different notion about
                    the propriety of such barter, they set off quietly for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> wharf when they heard the boatman's familiar horn. Their arms full, they
                    hurried <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-041-2-073"/> up the gangplank, bent on getting their business over
                    before their father or one of his associates might spy them. Breathlessly, they waited while the
                    proprietor weighed and counted their little stock, seeing in their minds' eyes the shining
                    pennies they would have to spend at the blindman's store.</p>
            <p>The boatman took his time, and then he made them a startling proposition. How would they like to have
                    their pictures "took?" Breathlessly, they agreed. While the photographer got out
                    his magic, they giggled and grew hot and cold by turns. Finally, they sobered up, smoothed their
                    hair, and tried not to let their curiosity get the best of them.</p>
            <p>They were walking on air when they left the boat a few minutes later. They carried the picture on a
                    square of milky-looking glass in a neat little frame. It opened up like a book, and there against a
                    background of garnet satin and pierced gold tinsel was the familiar face of Alice and young Eliza,
                    solemn and owlish, perhaps, but for all the world as plain as their own reflection in one of the
                    mirrors at home.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Warren laughs when she speaks of that picture. "My mother didn't like it, for
                    some reason, and it was never shown in our house, but Alice and I were proud of it!" Not
                    many young ladies in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> were having their likeness made on glass in the year 1860.</p>
            <p>Eliza and Alice did not go to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> public school. Being English, Mrs. Bethell wanted them taught at home, and a governess
                    was brought from the East when the girls were old enough for rudimentary learning. In spite of this,
                    Eliza had a great curiosity about the public school. She persuaded her mother one day to let her go
                    to school with a young lad who was often in the Bethell home. None of that day's routine is
                    remembered. But one thing remains clear in her memory. There was a pigtail in the boy's
                    lunch pail, a delicacy not found on the Bethell table, and young Eliza ate it with curiosity and a
                    great deal of relish.</p>
            <p>Delaney Academy<hi rend="sup">10</hi> was an institution of higher learning. It stood in the grove of
                    beautiful trees west of town. In the year 1842 the Indiana Presbytery had obtained a charter from
                    the state legislature and founded an academy to promote the cause of education. The first academy
                    was located in a building on the side of the hill facing Jennings Street. <list type="footnotes">

                    spread, students came from all the surrounding country, and enlargements were necessary. The new red
                    brick building west of town was called Delaney Academy in honor of Henry F. Delaney, an eminent

            <p>Eliza Bethell was ten when the word came of the firing on Fort Sumter. Though her father was a
                    Democrat, he was a strict abolitionist, and he was in sympathy with Lincoln's policies, so
                    much so, that he voted for the President's second term.</p>
            <p>In the Bethell home politics were discussed freely, and men came and went, consulting Colonel Bethell
                    on many matters. He was a liberal-minded man, well-advanced in his views for the day. He served in
                    the thirty-eighth session, 1857, of the state legislature,<hi rend="sup">11</hi> and was an ardent
                    supporter of Robert Dale Owen's law reforms providing for women's rights and free
                    schools. Like Owen, he was interested in the new cult of Spiritualism.</p>
            <p>Young Eliza and her sister, Alice, felt the excitement in the air when the news of the declaration of
                    war flared across the country. Their father, as Colonel of the Militia, was frequently away from
                    home drilling his men and attending to his business. No doubt, he was more concerned about the war
                    than he dared admit to those nearest him. For there were now five daughters under the sloping gray
                    roof, and another daughter was to be born before the war was over.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Bethell interests now included, besides the general store, a cooperage, a tobacco warehouse, a
                    mill, and an interest in a coal mine. The tobacco warehouse lay directly below the Bethell home on

                    the season loading- tobacco in hogsheads, and rolling them up the gangplanks of <placeName>

            <p>The cooperage was farther up the river. It turned out a hundred barrels a day. The barrels were used
                    to ship flour milled in the Bethell flouring mill, not two hundred yards distant toward the east. So
                    compact was the arrangement of Bethell's business, it is said, that coal ran off the tipple
                    trough at the mine into bins at the mill, and the flour was turned out warm into spanking new
                    barrels from the cooperage and rolled down to the Bethell warehouse, where wharf hands had it on the
                    steamboats before the farmer had counted his pay at the cashier's window—an
                    exaggeration that had in it a great deal of truth.</p>
            <p>Thomas Bethell readily accepted Governor Morton's commission to help train the Indiana

                    </placeName>, and the laborious work of making soldiers of raw recruits began there. Bethell was
                    captain of Company I of the Twenty-fifth Regiment. Later, this same regiment went out under the

                    guerrilla warfare, and from pirating by river. Mrs. Warren recalls one incident of particular
                    interest.</p>
            <p>One sunny morning as she and Alice were playing in the shadow of the house, they heard the tramp of
                    marching feet, the quickening rattle of drums, and the high, shrill notes of the fife, that meant
                    soldiers on the march. They ran swiftly to the stone wall that hedged them in from the public road
                    flanking the river. There, not a stone's throw away, was a company of blue-coated soldiers
                    keeping sober step, their eyes straight ahead. It was very exciting, for the brass buttoms gleamed
                    on the blue uniforms, and the drums kept up their rapid rattling fury.</p>
            <p>Soon they spied a tall soldier walking in the midst of the others. He wore the blue uniform of his
                    fellows, but oddly <list type="footnotes">

                    and it gave him a freakish look. He walked sullenly, looking down at the ground. They did not
                    understand it, but later their father told them that the soldier was being drummed out of the army
                    for misconduct. He had wanted to desert and had purposely put his fingers on the rails in front of a
                    moving coal car. His hand was crushed so that he could never carry a gun again. His fellow soldiers
                    had branded him to show that he was no longer wanted in their company.</p>

                    In the summer some of the men lay on cots on the outside gallery that ran along the west wall of the

                    became acute. The children were taught to tear them into strips and to scrape the pieces for lint,
                    which they put into pails to be sterilized. This lint was used to staunch the flow of blood or to
                    dress a wound as sterile cotton is used today. Mrs. Warren remembers that the linen was precious,
                    and that it had to be scraped until nothing but the warp thread was left.</p>

                    scene of action seldom failed to carry the name of one known in the community among the casualties.
                    Many of the wounded soldiers in the hospital died and were buried with military honors in the
                    village cemetery.</p>
            <p>Feelings ran high at times, for the river marked a tenuous boundary between North and South. Some
                    citizens were accused of being Southern sympathizers, and blood was shed on one occasion by an angry <placeName>

            <p>It was in July, 1862, that a little band of rebel Marauders under the bold leadership of Captain Adam
                    Johnston rowed across the river in a boat and accosted Union Bethell in his warehouse, where guns
                    and ammunition were stored for the militia. They held him at the point of a gun, while their boat
                    was loaded with firearms.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Encouraged by this success, Captain Johnston took an aide and walked into Hazen's Hotel,
                    where a number of townsmen had gathered. Ordering them to stack their guns, he told them that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> was surrounded, and that any move or resistance on their part would be a signal for the
                    men manning the cannon on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    into such a trap, obeyed to a man.</p>
            <p>The news spread like wildfire in the village. Dr. Eli Lewis, who had married Aunt Eliza, mounted his
                    horse and rode at furious speed across the fields and back lanes to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to warn the citizens and beg their aid for <placeName>

                    </placeName>. When he reached the courthouse steps in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>

                    discovered that the "cannon" across the river was a charred log and a stovepipe
                    mounted on wagon wheels. They had appeared realistic enough from the opposite shore.</p>
            <p>In the excitement that resulted, two <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> men were accused of giving aid to the enemy. An angry mob gathered and hanged them at
                    sundown. They cut down the bodies later and left them lying in an old wagon in front of Dr.
                    Slaughter's home on the public road, as an example of what might happen to other
                    "traitors."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Warren's recollection of the affair was principally sympathy for Uncle Eli and the loss
                    of his valuable horse, though Alice had had the exciting experience of having the cannon pointed out
                    to her by a man in the village that morning, when she had gone to the meat market to get the
                    beefsteak for breakfast.</p>
            <p>Some families, before they had learned of the ruse, had hastily packed their valuables and fled. The
                    Slaughter family had carried their silver to the woods back of the town and buried it, though their
                    colored housekeeper refused to budge <list type="footnotes">

                    supper ready for them when they were ready to come home.</p>
            <p>The news of the Northern army's first victory was celebrated with wild enthusiasm by the
                    young men of the town. Young George Bell, in attempting to fire off the cannon on top of the hill
                    overlooking the wharves, lost his left arm. Though this put a damper on the celebration, there was a
                    feeling of general satisfaction among the townspeople over the news.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Warren recalls the tranquil days too—the pleasant Sabbath mornings when she and Alice
                    walked to the little church set in the side of the Methodist Hill where one walked up a stairway on
                    the outside to enter the sanctuary. She did not know then that she would be married in its quiet
                    cool interior on a bright May Sabbath in the year 1877, to one of the young men now fighting so
                    valiantly with General Grant at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vicksburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. That young man was William Warren, and he came out of the battle with the loss of an
                    arm.</p>
            <p>She remembers Josiah Gray's interesting little ferryhouse that stood near the present
                    location of the Government Dam House. It was a story-and-a-half, and its plastered walls were
                    covered with grotesque figures and pictures made by the smoke and soot of candle flames.</p>
            <p>There was always something going on in the big Bethell kitchen with its scrubbed ash floors.
                    Grandmother Rachel Floyd was always busy in her quiet Southern way. She would laugh and tell them
                    how times had changed since she and Grandfather Cloud had "brought up" a family in
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange County</region>
                    </placeName> wilderness-for instance, she would never have thought of having a tinner come to solder
                    the tin cups of fruit in the canning season as her daughter-in-law did. My, but times had changed
                    since she had cut and dried her peaches and strung them across the rafters, and sealed her
                    applebutter in its own heavy sweetness in stone covered jars! Nor had she ever had her teeth
                    "plugged" in the modern way either. When a tooth had ached it had been drawn,
                    usually by one of the family. But young Eliza had the toothache frequently, and her father would
                    take her to the kindly new dentist, Dr. Morgan, who had established himself and his family in the
                    white cottage beyond A. M. Phelps' residence on State Street. She recalls that no sooner
                    had her feet touched his steps than the tooth stopped aching.</p>
            <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-041-2-079"/>
            <p>Dr. Morgan had a daughter Carrie. She taught drawing as well as other branches of learning in the
                    public school. By this time Eliza and Alice were having their music with the other young ladies in
                    the basement of the Presbyterian Church.</p>
            <p>Eliza was twelve in 1863, the eventful year of the war. She went with her family one summer afternoon
                    to a celebration for the soldiers in the beautiful wooded grove surrounding Delaney Academy. There
                    were long tables spread with food under the trees. The Academy was closed because the Cumberland
                    Presbyterian Church could no longer support a school in the North. During the afternoon someone
                    suggested looking inside the building. There were maps, pictures, and globes in the schoolrooms. A
                    closet door was half ajar. Eliza put her hand on the knob. The door opened suddenly, and a human
                    skeleton tumbled out! It was a most frightening experience.</p>
            <p>At twelve Eliza began to take more interest in clothes. Mrs. Bethell's sewing woman came
                    twice a year, and stayed until every yard of goods was made up into frocks and petticoats. In the
                    Bethell home where there were six girls, this was not a small order. But the family was the proud
                    possessor of a new sewing machine with a curved needle. The needle would get "angry and
                    balk," and no amount of coaxing would persuade it to move. They would go away and leave it,
                    and after a little rest it would usually hum again.</p>
            <p>The hardships and privations of war did not touch young Eliza, for youth has always had a way of
                    making trifles of misfortunes. The routine in the Bethell household changed little from day to day,
                    and she and Alice went about their own affairs, scarcely aware of the disaster that had overtaken
                    their father's business. The blockade of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> had seriously crippled the business of the merchants up and down the river, and was in
                    a fair way of ruining many warehouse owners whose goods were spoiling on the wharves, while they
                    waited for news of Grant's seige of Vicksburg.</p>
            <p>About this time Colonel Bethell hired a steamboat to carry a large consignment of goods upstream to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. From there it was to be hauled overland to the Atlantic and sent by ship to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. Cured meats, flour, and tobacco made up the principal part of the cargo of the little
                    steamer, as she left the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> wharf and started her trip eastward. <pb n="182" id="VAA4025-041-2-080"/> It was a
                    perilous undertaking, for insurance was practically unknown, and the risk was all with the shipper.
                    Besides this, the river was infested by Southern guerrilla bands, who lay in wait on the wooded
                    shores to pick off such rich cargoes.</p>
            <p>Not far from <placeName>

                    </placeName> the boat caught fire, and both it and the cargo were destroyed. It was an almost
                    overwhelming misfortune to Colonel Bethell who was responsible for the loss of the boat as well as
                    the goods. But he managed in the years following to meet his obligations without losing all of his
                    business.</p>
            <p>There is perhaps only one business house left in New-burgh today, whose doors were open when Eliza
                    Bethell was a girl. That is the establishment of Charles Frank on Water Street fronting the river.
                    Today, Mr. Frank's two daughters, Elizabeth and Lena, carry on the business established

                    in the same business. He became one of the country's largest landholders, and his vision
                    and generosity were factors in the town's development.</p>

            <p>One can still hear an old story in the barber shops of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a story of The Underground Railway. On certain dark nights when the moon is in its
                    last quarter, it is said a pickaninny cherub haunts the pool of water near the old Delaney Academy.
                    The little angel wears a halo of luminous blue light and moves mournfully among the old trees like a
                    child that has lost its mother. An explanation of the story is this:</p>
            <p>Long before the war a negro slave escaped from her cruel owners with two of her children. One of them
                    was a babe in arms. She was aided in crossing the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and was set ashore in the darkness. She was told to go directly north and to follow the
                    sycamores until she had crossed a rivulet on her path. Not far distant, on her left, she would find
                    a red brick house where she would be given food and shelter.</p>
            <p>Following the directions carefully, she suddenly realized that she was being pursued. The babe had
                    begun to whimper, and she made a hasty decision. If she could quiet the baby's cries, she
                    and the other child might have a chance for freedom. She crossed the rivulet and saw the pool.
                    Stooping, she immersed the wailing child in the water and then fled swiftly from the scene. To this
                    day its spirit is said to haunt the place.</p>
            <p>Appealing as this story is, Mrs. Warren discredits the stories of underground operations in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. She does admit, however, that she has lain awake nights listening to the eerie bay of
                    the bloodhounds, as they tracked down runaway slaves on the opposite shore.</p>
            <p>Now and then a nostalgia assails her to relive the happy golden days of her youth in <placeName>

                    on the land.</p>
            <p>But the future did not look too dark to the young people of that day. The boats were still on the

            <p>Since acquiring the 450 acres that comprise the Angel Mounds archaeological site near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1938, the Historical Society has contemplated the proper public use of the area.
                    Excavations directed by Glenn A. Black, archaeologist for the society, have uncovered valuable
                    relics of the first inhabitants of Indiana. The general layout of the village has been determined,
                    and more than two million pieces of man-made objects have been removed for study. Work continues at
                    the site.</p>
            <p>In purchasing the tract, the society used funds it was reserving for museum purposes. Now the state
                    is moving toward rehabilitation of the state museum. The society has considered giving the Angel
                    Mounds site to the state on two conditions: that some restoration of the village be undertaken on
                    the basis of the archaeological evidence, and that the society be allotted space in any new museum
                    building acquired by the state. Action was taken by the executive committee on June 8, and a letter
                    prepared for Governor Gates containing the offer of the site. The Governor replied, enthusiastically
                    endorsing the proposal, and has referred it to the Department of Conservation. In anticipation of
                    the gift, the last General Assembly passed a resolution to create a committee to accept the gift of
                    any historical site to the state.</p>
            <p>Part of the acreage at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Angel Mounds</settlement>
                    </placeName> can be used for recreational purposes by the visiting public. Mr. Black already teaches
                    at Indiana University, and the mounds make an unrivaled laboratory for student archaeologists. The
                    society will continue to make explorations after the property passes out of its hands. Once before
                    the state and the society co-operated in the housing of the society library. In return for quarters
                    in the State Library and Historical Building, the society allows the public to consult its library
                    of source materials.</p>
            <p>The society is supporting the effort of the Filson Club to persuade the electors for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> University's Hall of Fame to award George Rogers Clark a place therein. He has
                    before received enough votes to constitute a nomination, but not a sufficient majority to be
                    admitted.</p>
            <pb n="186" id="VAA4025-041-2-084"/>
            <p>As there was doubt about the expiration of the term of the present membership of the Advisory
                    Committee to the Historical Bureau, the executive committee has made up a slate of nominations to
                    this committee. Members are appointed by the State Library and Historical Board. The Advisory
                    Committee links the Historical Society and the Bureau and provides a representative body for the
                    director of the Bureau to consult.</p>
            <p>Paid annual memberships in the society stood at 1200 on June 8, compared with 1128 at the same time
                    last year. While this total places Indiana among the top eleven state historical societies in the
                    country, it should by no means represent a maximum figure. The <placeName>

                    trustworthy. For these reasons the appearance of a second letter of Walter K. Jordan, who was
                    present at the massacre, is a matter of interest and of some importance. The account which the
                    letter contains is substantially the same as given in a previous letter, but its publication should
                    help to settle some doubts about <placeName>

                    sought to discredit Captain Heald, misstating facts in order to accomplish his purpose. This account

                    Robert B. McAfee. It is one of the best contemporary narratives of the War of 1812, and it contains
                    a brief description of the massacre as reported by Sergeant William Griffith who was present.
                    Although it does not pretend to be in his exact words, it does seem to be "a plain,

            <p>There appeared in <hi rend="i">Niles' Weekly Register</hi>, May 8, 1813, what purported to
                    be an "Extract of a letter from Walter Jordan, a non-commissioned officer of the regulars
                    at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>

                    </placeName>, October 19, 1812." Whether it is an extract of a third letter or a poorly
                    copied portion of the letter of October 12, it is not possible to determine. It would seem quite
                    reasonable to assume that his wife carried out his request to send a copy of the letter of October
                    12 to Joseph Hunter, omitting the very personal portions at the end in which <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> told of his wages and sent endearing remarks to his family. It is possible that his
                    wife was as poor, or a poorer scribe than he and that the extract was recopied before reaching <hi rend="i">Niles' Register</hi>, which may account for some of the differences between
                    the portion printed and the original. The <hi rend="i">Niles' Register</hi> extract gives
                    evidence that <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName>'s spelling and poor choice of words were corrected. In order to show the
                    possible relationship, the two are given side by side.</p>

            <p>The hitherto unpublished letter was apparently nearly-obtained by Dr. Quaife in 1920, but the fact

            <p>One must inquire whether these manuscripts are forgeries or genuine letters. This is particularly
                    true since Dr. Quaife in his <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                        </placeName> and the Old Northwest</hi> rejected the extract of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> letter which appeared in <hi rend="i">Niles' Weekly Register</hi> as a
                    "worthless fabrication." It should be noted that the original letters of October
                    12 and December 17 were not then known to scholars and were not therefore included in this judgment.
                    Dr. Quaife is not to be criticized for rejecting this extract, for the inaccuracies and the term
                    "Confute <pb n="195" id="VAA4025-041-2-093"/> Indians" certainly were enough to
                    arouse great suspicion.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> After the letter of October 12 was published, Dr.
                    Quaife revised his previous conclusion about <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> The early publication of what probably was a portion of the
                    letter to "Betcy," indicates that one letter at least was in existence as early as
                    May 8, 1813. The appearance of the letters today tend to confirm the belief that they are very old.
                    They are written on good substantial paper in the same poor handwriting and are torn along the folds
                    from much handling. Professor Logan Esarey published the letter of October 12<hi rend="sup">18</hi>having satisfied himself that the letter to "Betcy" was an actual account
                    of the massacre. The appearance of the second or later letter, which was apparently in the hands of
                    another branch of the family until recent years, and its similarity in respect to paper, penmanship,
                    and contents seems to establish the genuineness of both letters.</p>
            <p>The accuracy and truthfulness of the letters must also be considered. <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> was as careless of dates and numbers as many indifferent history students. Captain
                    Wells left <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> on August 8, but in both letters <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> seems to have stated that they left on the first. The figure, however, is hard to
                    decipher and may have been a 4 or 7. He stated that they arrived on the tenth in the first letter
                    and on the ninth in the second letter. The date of the massacre he has correct in both letters. The
                    number of Indians accompanying Wells to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> he gave in each letter as 100. The other accounts differ but all give a smaller number.
                    Heald gave the number as "abount 30," Helm as 27, and McAfee as "about
                    50." It would seem that <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> exaggerated but that no one was certain of the exact number. In the letter to
                    "Betcy" he wrote that the persons leaving <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName>, not including Indians, totaled 132 or 100 men of Heald's force, 10 women, 20
                    children, and Wells and <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName>. In the letter to Hunter he wrote that there were 130 men, women, and children. These
                    are larger than the estimates made by Heald, Helms, and McAfee, all of whom differ with each other. <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> gave the number not killed as, 15, apparently referring only to men. Heald stated in

                    journal he recorded the survivors as 27 men and 11 women and children. Helm's account is
                    contradictory, and comparative numbers are confused. The account in McAfee says that "the
                    ranks were so reduced, as scarcely to exceed 20 effective men." In one letter <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> wrote that the engagement lasted about ten minutes while in the other about twenty
                    minutes. All of these figures make it evident that <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> was careless about numbers and dates and that none of the accounts agree. It is not
                    surprising that in the excitement of the massacre <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> should have become somewhat confused, but not all of the inaccuracies can be explained
                    as confusion. The exaggerations and the reference in the letter of October 12 to criticism by his
                    wife indicate that he was endeavoring to make himself appear important to his wife and friends.
                    Surely a forger would not have been so careless. The inaccuracies lessen the value of the letters,
                    but not their genuineness.</p>

                    Captain J. Rhea, the commandant. On December 26, 1812, he was charged with neglect of duty on the
                    previous evening (Christmas), to which he pled guilty and prayed the mercy of the court. He was
                    reduced to the rank of a private, but was reinstated as a corporal on January 7, 1813, at the
                    request of the officers of the company. Evidently excessive Christmas celebration was not regarded
                    too seriously. He served as a witness at a court martial on January 25, and June 16. On August 23,
                    1813, he was charged with counterfeiting and forging a permit to buy one pint of whiskey. For this
                    he was again reduced to the rank of a private. The last pages of the orderly book are missing and we
                    do not know whether he was reinstated or not. It is a <list type="footnotes">

                    signed the letter of October 12, "W. K. Jordan Sergent," and in the letter of
                    December 17, he states, "I was apoind Sargant Last July." On July 24, 1812, he was
                    appointed corporal, but there is no record of his appointment as sergeant. In the second letter he
                    wrote "During the ingagement the fether was Shot out of my Cap the aplett of of my Shoulder

                                    Wells returned, bringing intelligence that on the morning of the 15th (or as he
                                    calculated time, four nights ago), Captain Heald and his company, with Captain
                                    Wells, were all cut off; the particulars of which he thus related. They arrived at <placeName>

                                    being well acquainted with Indian customs, and seeing the difficulties likely to
                                    attend Captain Heald in getting away from his post, used every exertion in his power
                                    to effect an evacuation without the loss of men; he even gave up all the arsenal and
                                    magazine stores to satisfy their savage ferocity, but to no effect, and then agreed
                                    to deliver up all the cattle (about 100 head) and made them several other valuable
                                    presents in hopes of being permitted to depart in peace. The fatal morning arrived,
                                    and while the bloodthirsty savages were killing and dressing their beaves, the
                                    garrison was evacuated. Captains Heald and Wells marching in front, the baggage
                                    wagon next, the women and children next to it, followed by the soldiers and the
                                    thirty-five Indians with their pack horses bringing up the rear. They had not passed
                                    one mile from their little asylum when the alarm was given that the enemy, about 400
                                    in number, was close upon them. A kind of hollow square was formed immediately,
                                    encompassing the women and children, and two rounds fired, but being overpowered by
                                    numbers, the brave, the innocent fair and the helpless, fell a prey to the savage
                                    cruelty of the tomahawk and scalping knife. We have since been told by another
                                    Indian that Captain Heald and lady (both wounded), W. Flanzay and wife, Lieutenant
                                    Helms and wife, and nineteen soldiers were made prisoners and sent to <placeName>

                    destruction. They add a detail about the fate of Captain Wells. Other accounts refer to his heart

            <p>In this volume the authors have made an interesting and valuable contribution to the social history
                    of the early Midwest.</p>
            <p>Much has been written of the contact of the pioneers with the Indians. But the Indian was a foe the
                    pioneer could see and understand, against whom he could organize, a foe he could drive out, or
                    exterminate. But in his ills the pioneer met a foe he could neither see nor understand, a foe that
                    might strike suddenly, and with frightful effect, incapacitating fifty per cent of a garrison or
                    settlement, a foe before which seventy per cent of the population of a town might flee in panic and
                    terror, a foe that took a death toll far exceeding that of Indian massacres and wars.</p>
            <p>In their preface the authors tell us the "book is a by-product of more extensive work in the
                    field of middle western history." As historians they have known where to seek for material
                    and how to document their findings. Though they state "the study makes no pretense at being
                    exhaustive," their reading has been extensive, as testified by a bibliography of hundreds
                    of titles filling eighteen pages.</p>
            <p>The authors tell the story of cholera creeping westward from <placeName>

                    people fled in blind terror from this disease. Though no cases appeared in Bloom-ington, due to the
                    dread of the disease there was no meeting of the Board of Trustees of Indiana University in that
                    year, 1832. Governor Noble proclaimed a day of fasting and prayers for the arrest of the disease.</p>

                    <p>Even to one having some knowledge of the state and conditions of medical practice in pioneer

                        leaves one amazed at the ignorance and superstitution, the false theories of disease and the

                </quote>
            <p>But the judgment of pioneer medical practice in the Midwest must not be too harsh. The authors quote
                    Dr. William H. Welch of Johns Hopkins as saying: "The best of these men were withal,
                    abreast in knowledge, training and skill with their contemporaries of the Atlantic coast."
                    It should be recalled that in the first half of the nineteenth century there was no knowledge of the
                    part played by microorganisms as a cause of disease or of sepsis in wounds or operations.</p>
            <p>An interesting feature of pioneer medical practice as portrayed <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-041-2-099"/>
                    in this book is the degree to which people became partisans of one or another of the numerous cults,
                    or systems of treatment. So prevalent was the hydrargyric propensity, especially in fevers that a
                    doctor who failed to conform was deemed in the popular mind guilty of malpractice.
                    Sappington's <hi rend="i">The Theory and Treatment of Fevers</hi> was published, 1844, in
                    an effort to induce an even more widespread use of quinine. The animosity between cults was so
                    intense that the on-looking public was much confused as to which was really the doctor, and which
                    the quack. Though temperance was advocated by some physicians, Dr. William Tichenor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> advertised, 1828, that: "His shop is two doors below Mr. Hawkin's
                    tavern, where he generally will be found, except when attending to professional business."</p>
            <p>Even among doctors few realize how extensive the lobelia inflata cult became, how many thousands
                    throughout the North, and South to the Gulf fell under the spell of Dr. Thompson, its chief
                    advocate. There was Dr. Carter with his hypo, and Dr. Buchanan with his organ of Sensibility, his
                    favorite bump. There were the Homeopaths with their billionth strength of dosage, the botanies, the
                    calomel doctors with their salivation, the Eclectics who for a long time played a prominent part in
                    medical education and practice. There were crosses between major cults and numerous other minor
                    cults, some of which were built on the supposed efficacy of a single remedy.</p>
            <p>The authors tell briefly of the efforts in medical education up to the second half of the nineteenth
                    century. Consultation in critical cases was very difficult to arrange. Self-reliance and
                    individualism were overdeveloped. This fact made cooperative effort, so necessary in medical
                    education, extremely difficult. Faculties were short-lived and were split apart by internal strife.</p>
            <p>The authors tell us of efforts in the early Middle West at licensure of physicians. In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> we see legislation for regulation of medical practice enacted in 1821, repealed in
                    1824, re-enacted, criticized, and in 1833 again repealed, indicating lack of agreement among members
                    of the profession and confusion of legislators as to proper regulation of licensure.</p>
            <p>In Indiana there were legislative efforts at regulation of Medical Practice for thirty years prior to
                    1849 when the Indiana State Medical Society was revived, and from which date it has had continuous
                    existence and finally sponsored licensure.</p>
            <p>Yet ignorance slowly gave way to more rational views. The <hi rend="i">Journal of Health</hi> was
                    begun in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1830. Dr. Dudley was among the first to stress boiling water in surgery, etc., etc.</p>
            <p>The text is free of the fine print which makes Garrison's <hi rend="i">An Introduction, to
                        the History of Medicine</hi> hard reading. There are fine print notes but they are found in
                    sixteen pages at the close of the book.</p>
            <p>The authors are to be congratulated on giving so much of detail in so readable a form. One has the
                    feeling they enjoyed its preparation. Most doctors and laymen will find the story in satisfying
                    detail. The few who wish to dig deeper will find their guide in the extensive bibliography.</p>

            <p>Leslie W. Dunlap, newly appointed Assistant Chief of the General Reference and Bibliography Division
                    of the Library of Congress, has compiled a very readable volume concerning the sixty-five American
                    historical societies organized before the Civil War. They were organized because "the
                    interest in the growth of the American nation was sufficiently strong and widespread to cause men in
                    all sections … to seek historical records. The young republic had no research libraries
                    to care for such material, so other agencies had to be established to perform this
                    function."</p>
            <p>As sources for the work, publications of the societies have been consulted but less generally known
                    facts have come from the correspondence files which contain much information about other historical
                    organizations. Within a week after the first meeting of the Indiana Historical Society on December
                    11, 1830, its secretary, John Hay Farnham of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was instructed to communicate with similar institutions. Farnham, who had been
                    extremely active in organizing the society, had been born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, was a graduate of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> and in 1831 became a corresponding member of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society. He was also a member of the American Antiquarian Society. It was
                    his correspondence with Nathan Dane of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Beverly</settlement>

                    </placeName>, 1897-), I, 69-70. Dane was made an honorary member of the Indiana society December 17,
                    1831. The sketch of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Historical and Antiquarian Society states that two years after its formation the
                    society sought to open correspondence with other societies of similar character. The third and last
                    historical group listed as formed in Indiana before 1860 is the Historical Society of the County of
                    Vigo, Indiana, which celebrated its first anniversary in 1844. A speech delivered on that occasion
                    by the Reverend Robert B. Croes seems to be the only surviving record of the society's
                    existence.</p>
            <p>Throughout this volume the author has stressed the size and growth of historical society libraries,
                    the scope of their materials, and their early printed catalogues, their performance in the early
                    eighteen hundreds of some of the functions of public libraries before these were so well
                    established. He also emphasized their use by such patrons as Elihu Burrit, the self-taught
                    "learned blacksmith" who acquired much of his knowledge from the American
                    Antiquarian Society library, Peter Force, who examined many collections in the preparation of his
                        <hi rend="i">American Archives</hi>, Benjamin Lossing, who often used the library of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society while working on his <hi rend="i">Pictorial Field-book of the
                        Revolution</hi>, and many other famous and scholarly persons. Another less scholarly but
                    well-known patron was Mrs. E.D.E.N. Southworth <pb n="203" id="VAA4025-041-2-101"/> who asked the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society for information about Sir George Calvert whom she wished to make the
                    hero of a novel. Perhaps Capitola, the madcap maid, was to be the heroine. So great was the emphasis
                    upon the acquisition, preservation, and recording of materials that the first salaried staff member
                    of any of the societies was a librarian employed in 1818 by the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Association. These librarians seem to have been persons of considerable ability and
                    certainly of extraordinary devotion. Christopher Columbus Baldwin, that most zealous
                    collector-librarian, employed in 1832 by the American Antiquarian Society, asked in his diary
                    "But what right has a librarian to have any affection but for books and MSS? I doubt his
                    authority for any other love, even tho' it be for a beautiful lady."</p>
            <p>The experiences the Indiana Historical Society had in common with other organizations are cited
                    throughout. It is known that for a time election of members was omitted by the Indiana as well as
                    other societies. The Indiana society is listed among those once receiving state aid, having been
                    given a legislative appropriation of $500 in 1859. Lectures delivered before the
                    membership were said also to have been sometimes rambling with little reference to the local
                    community, but Judge John Law's address before the <placeName>

                    </placeName> society required a second edition before 1860.</p>
            <p>Altogether more than five hundred printed works were issued by fifty-five organizations during- this
                    period despite great difficulties and the societies were also responsible for publication of
                    documentary materials by state and federal agencies.</p>

                    According to the editors, Indiana stands fourth in the number of societies following

            <p>In arrangement of the information, names of societies are arranged alphabetically under the states in
                    which they are located, with address, names of officers, staff on salary, membership, dues, and
                    annual income. Notes about libraries and their contents and some information about museums is given.
                    New features relate to hours open, whether or not duplicating facilities are available and the
                    official to whom correspondence should be addressed is indicated. An attempt has been made to list
                    publications but unfortunately there is <pb n="204" id="VAA4025-041-2-102"/> much less detailed
                    information as to dates, volume numbers and specific titles than in the previous edition, an
                    omission especially regrettable to order and exchange librarians attempting to complete files and to
                    serial cataloguers seeking bibliographical information. Omitted, too, have been the notes about the
                    housing of the societies.</p>
            <p>It is suggested that the editor of the next edition include more notes about ownership of historic
                    sites and a fuller description of library holdings unless some better description of special
                    libraries and collections has been issued than is now available. Usually collections are called by
                    the donor's name which does not always have much to do with content. It would be helpful,
                    too, if patriotic societies which publish historical materials could be included.</p>
            <p>The percentage of typographical errors seems fairly high. In the repeated phrase of a local radio
                    newsman "Hoosiers can always smile" and some of them laughed right out loud when
                    it was discovered that a local historical society was listed as located in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hells County</region>
                    </placeName> but the proofreader in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> must have been startled to discover that such a trick has been played upon a county
                    properly named Wells. Another of the obvious, or perhaps not so obvious, misprints in the Indiana
                    list is the spelling of Quistenon instead of Ouiatenon for the name of the French fort in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe County</region>
                    </placeName>. It should be noted, too, that it is Mrs. George W. Blair, not Mrs. George W. Bevin,
                    who is chairman of the Indiana Library and Historical Board. Various other errors in personal and
                    geographical names occur.</p>

            <p>Written by a graduate who is now a member of its faculty, this history is both a scholarly work and a
                    labor of love. In many respects it is an ideal history of a college, ideal because Oberlin made
                    important contributions to many significant developments, because the author is so much a part of
                    Oberlin that he understands it thoroughly, because his love for his alma mater required of him the
                    best workmanship, and his scholarly training would be satisfied only with the highest standards.
                    Oberlin's record was great enough that unfortunate and unfavorable episodes and events
                    could be and were discussed <pb n="205" id="VAA4025-041-2-103"/> frankly. Historians of other
                    institutions will do well to study this work carefully. Oberlin was particularly important in the
                    Middle West, where it was intended to "civilize" the "desolate
                    valley," and where it spearheaded many reform movements. Oberlin's leadership in
                    the antislavery movement brought her prominence in the Civil War and Reconstruction and so her
                    history has national importance. Oberlin represented the Yankee invasion of the Middle West, not the
                    conservative culture of <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName>, but rather the radical, unorthodox, crusading, uncompromising missionary element.</p>
            <p>The author found the roots of his college in the migration of New Englanders to the Middle West, the
                    revivalism of Charles G. Finney, the manual labor schools, the Oberlin colony, and the early
                    emancipation movement. The Lane revolt brought to Oberlin, the Lane Rebels, the support of Theodore
                    Weld, the money of Arthur and Lewis Tappan, the preaching of Charles G. Finney, and the precedent of
                    freedom of discussion and freedom from racial prejudice. In addition to abolitionism,
                    "God's College" became identified with perfectionism, evangelism,
                    pacificism, feminism, and dietary and physiological reform. Joint education of the sexes, the
                    training of the negroes in the same classes with white men and women, and the early attention to
                    agriculture and even to business training are among Oberlin's claims to distinction. With
                    reformers getting in each others way and one reform movement crowding hard upon the heels of
                    another, perhaps Finney's constant insistence upon evangelism and the saving of souls was
                    the salvation of the college as well as many of its students. In the Civil War, Oberlinites were
                    interested not so much in preserving the nation as in the opportunity it afforded to destroy
                    slavery. Having aided in civilizing the Middle West, and in saving <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, Oberlin found in Reconstruction the prospect of converting and puritanizing the South.
                    Its energies went chiefly into the work of the Freedman's Bureau and in negro education,
                    and its leaders made no apologies for their support of the Republican party while carrying on their
                    official duties.</p>
            <p>This work is unusually free from misstatements of fact, typographical errors, or rank prejudices,
                    which sometimes mar historical works. The chief defect seems to be the long detailed narration and
                    description of student life and activity contained in the fourth book. To many, no doubt, these
                    chapters will appeal, but to others they may prove a strong incentive to lay the second volume aside
                    before they reach the significant concluding chapter in which is told the story of
                    Oberlin's progress towards orthodoxy and "respectability" and of the
                    nation's acceptance of many of Oberlin's pecularities as desirable and proper. The
                    workmanship expended upon these volumes is excellent and this includes footnotes, bibliography,
                    index, paper, printing, and proofreading. A more attractive binding might have been in order.
                    Oberlin is, undoubtedly, fortunate in its historian and its history.</p>

                    </placeName> may well be termed a piece of historical revision, for Dr. Saye professedly sets out to
                    lay the popular myth of the founding of the colony primarily as a haven for prisoners and indigents
                    from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>'s lower economic groups. Nearly one-half of this volume deals with a
                    restatement and partial reinterpretation of that early history of the founding and growth of <placeName>

                    </placeName> under its first charter.</p>
            <p>Professor Saye approached his task with capable hands. His two scholarly articles on the genesis of <placeName>

                        </placeName> History.</hi> Herein he sets out to disprove the old generalization that Oglethorpe
                    founded <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> as a colony for the relief of debtors languishing in English prisons. Several theses
                    emerge in Saye's reinterpretation of this generalization: many of the founding fathers were
                    members of Parliament, interested in trade and protection of the colonial frontier, as well as in
                    debtor relief; debtor relief was but one of the several schemes advanced as colonizing lures. This
                    concept of charity soon took on the proportions of aid not only to the poor and unemployed of all
                    sorts in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, but of persecuted Protestants on the Continent as well. Actually, the best estimates
                    give only about a dozen released debtors as members of the early colonizing group.</p>
            <p>The frustrations and set-backs attendant upon colonization perhaps give the clew to the debtor-story
                    as the generalized gospel of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>'s origin. As enthusiasm waned among the majority of the Parliamentary group
                    associated with the founding of the colony, control was left largely "to a small group of
                    the more religious-minded Trustees." Perhaps this fact gave undue emphasis to the
                    philanthropic aspect of the colonizing motives. But any analysis of the ethnic constitution of the
                    early Georgian population completely dispels the "English Debtor" contention. The
                    early colonists were mainly persecuted Protestants and English of the "middle
                    poor." "There were Jews and Gentiles, English, Germans, Scotch, Irish, French,
                    Italians, Portuguese … Anglicans, Baptists, Presbyterians, Lutherans, Moravians
                    … graduates of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> … and hundreds of illiterates … there were in general men and
                    women of all walks of life."</p>
            <p>Though stress is laid on the genesis of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> colony, Dr. Saye carries the story up to the attainment of statehood under the Federal
                    Union. General Oglethorpe's part in the story is adequately told, and his autocratic
                    disposition in reference to the regulation of life in the colony is brought out. The career of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> as a royal colony is depicted, as well as her part in the War for Independence. The
                    construction of the state constitution in 1777 is analyzed in detail, as is in a lesser degree <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>

            <p>Throughout this study the author has maintained a good balance in his reliance on source and

            <p>Born of a strict, aristocratic French Huguenot background this very peculiar man sought throughout
                    most of his long life to champion the cause of the common man. In choosing such a course Flournoy
                    utilized his talents in generously criticizing many of the accepted institutions and customs of the
                    antebellum South. But the subject of this biography was no mere "pedlar of jeremaids, a
                    singer of songs of hate, a rabble rouser," he sought some constructive reforms.</p>
            <p>In order to place himself in a position to advocate reforms more successfully, Flournoy made three
                    unsuccessful races for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> legislature. He also sought conspicuous places in community life but always in vain.
                    Once having begun a career of agitation, by word and by pen, this eccentric person was as busy as
                    the proverbial bee. He wrote President Johnson in 1865: "I am always either reading or
                    working. Never idle."</p>
            <p>Mention can be made of only a few of the popular issues on which this reformer expressed himself. He
                    opposed Nullification, terming Calhoun a <hi rend="i">Cataline</hi>, and sought to keep the Cherokee
                    Indians in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>. As early as 1833, he petitioned the legislature to create, an institute for the
                    education of the deaf and dumb. He was an ardent pacifist because, he said, "God does not
                    approve of war." He believed that the Negroes in America were a curse to the white race and
                    advocated their expulsion to Africa.</p>
            <p>Flournoy was a prolific writer of pamphlets and poems. The former were used as an agency of
                    propaganda for advocated reforms while the latter, as a rule, taught moral lessons. One result of
                    these literary efforts was an interest in the curriculum of the University of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>. He hoped for more emphasis on English and less on Latin and Greek.</p>
            <p>The author has done an excellent job in research, footnoting, bibliography, and index. Regrettably,
                    the footnotes are in the back of the book.</p>

            <p>Yes, the northern part of the state has ancestor hunters, too. The genealogical corner of the Local
                    History Department of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> Public Library is a popular place although its volumes are limited. To supplement this
                    collection, the files of old newspapers, dating back to 1831, are consulted at the Northern Indiana
                    Historical Museum and the records of marriages, wills, and deeds are searched at the courthouse.</p>
            <p>The "Index to Marriages in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph County</region>
                    </placeName>," dates back to 1832. Volume one, an old, worn book with a very loose cover,
                    disappeared several years ago. In some clean-up process at the courthouse it must have been
                    discarded as useless—another instance of the loss of valuable material through
                    carelessness or ignorance. Very few of the family names in the early index are well-known names in
                    the community today. The ones that are known have been written into <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> history as "Founders." Many French names appear in the old records;
                    Madore Cratee, for example, whose marriage was recorded on page 36 of the lost book. His name is
                    inseparably connected with the <geogName>St. Joseph River</geogName>. As captain of the freight
                    boat, "Fairplay," the story of his life is the story of the <geogName>St. Joseph
                        River</geogName> in its days of navigation.</p>
            <p>The "Deeds of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph County</region>
                    </placeName>" are on file back to 1831 and the "Mortgages" date back to
                    1833. It is very fitting that the first property transfer in the book should concern Alexis
                    Coquillard, his wife Frances, and Samuel Hanna. It was Coquillard and Lathrop Taylor, Samuel
                    Hanna's brother-in-law, who laid out the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>. From old deeds one can often establish family relationships but it takes careful
                    reading of these documents. The property may be referred to as "that which I received from
                    my brother William" or "that which I received by will from my father."
                    Now and then a complete abstract is given on an old deed as, "this being the property
                    received by Elizabeth Smith as her dower right from the Court of Common Pleas and bequeathed by will
                    to her eldest son Samuel, who in turn willed it to his son John," etc.</p>

                    </placeName>, dated tenth day of March, 1832. If you can find an ancestor who made a will mentioning
                    each one of his children, his father and mother, and his wife's maiden name, you are in
                    luck. So often, through death or dissension in the family, the names of one or two of the children
                    were omitted when the bequests were handed out. In spite of the "uncertainty of this mortal
                    life," and the "sound and perfect memory" of the testator, wills can be
                    very confusing to the genealogical worker. While furniture, cattle, lands, and cash are listed with
                    great accuracy, the name you are looking for may be missing.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, is abstracting the obituaries and marriages from the <hi rend="i">Western Christian

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> since May 2, 1834. The bound volumes were borrowed through the Indiana State Library

                    marriages of persons of other denominations are included. In the case of the obituaries of
                    Methodists, the church affiliation of the parents is sometimes given; this information is included
                    in the abstracts as it may <pb n="213" id="VAA4025-041-2-111"/> be helpful to genealogists in
                    finding baptismal or other church records.</p>
            <p>Most of the obituaries., especially the earlier ones, are full of the religious history of the
                    deceased and his family. Some quite lengthy accounts furnish little of a genealogical nature while
                    others, perhaps much shorter, have a wealth of information. Unfortunately for descendants, the
                    persons writing the obituaries often failed to give information available at the time which would be
                    invaluable now. Following are two sample abstracts, picked at random, to show the type of

            <p>Most of the obituaries tell about the family migrations; this information is included in the
                    abstracts as a help to tracing families through census records or land entries. Some obituaries are
                    merely death notices and contain no genealogical helps at all—not even the exact date or
                    place of death. These are included, however, as they will give an approximate idea of the time and
                    place of death. The earlier obituaries were usually signed with the name of the writer, his place of

                    completed covering the years between 1834 and 1847. Volumes for some of these years are not
                    available. The abstracted material (covering about 3,700 deaths and 450 marriages) is being typed
                    and bound. One copy will be placed in the Genealogy Room, Indiana State Library.</p>

                    make it possible to reach the proper families some ten or twelve generations back. In a great
                    majority of cases, two or three brothers immigrated together, bringing wives and children; these
                    children, first cousins and of the same generation, often bore almost identical names thus making
                    identification uncertain and often entailing endless research if one tries to start with the
                    immigrating family.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> families migrated directly to Indiana from the Atlantic Coast states, the majority of

                    </placeName>; from thence members of the second or later generations moved to Indiana. The fact that

                    own Meetings after about 1770 because of restrictions against marriage between those who were of
                    "too near relation," made migration to new territory imperative to families in the
                    Eastern states. Many of these Friends would not move to the Southern states because of their
                    aversion to slavery, so they migrated to western <placeName>

                    </placeName> had their certificates transferred to one of these two Meetings. Persons coming after

                        <region type="state">Eastern Ohio</region>

                    </placeName> families from one section of the country met and married children of families from

                    genealogical research. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> became the center of a sort of double fan, one part of which reached back to the
                    Atlantic Coast states, while the other spread out toward Indiana, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

                    and other states to the westward. Although some families migrated to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, there were no early Meetings there; all Quakers living in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> deposited their certificates of removal with <placeName>

                    </placeName> Monthly Meetings. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> discipline regarding marriage made no distinction between Friends of different European
                    nationalities. As a result, descendants of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> ancestors usually have one or more strains of English, Dutch, Welsh, Scotch, and German
                    blood in their veins and occasional strains of Swedish and French Rhineland blood. The Quakers who
                    came to this country from <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> were almost exclusively of English blood and origin.</p>
            <p>All <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> genealogical records are recorded in the <pb n="216" id="VAA4025-041-2-114"/> Monthly
                    Meeting books. These include certificates of removal, disownments, members received on request,
                    births, marriages, and deaths. The records of members of Preparative Meetings and of Meetings for
                    Worship are recorded in the books of the Monthly Meeting to which they were attached. When a new
                    Monthly Meeting is established, its boundaries are definitely set out, and all members of the
                    Monthly Meetings who live within the boundaries of the new Meeting are automatically transferred
                    (usually without certificates) to this new Monthly Meeting. Although a family may have always lived
                    in the same place, it may have belonged to two or more Monthly Meetings. This is illustrated in a
                    recent letter which Mr. Hinshaw received, telling of certain persons living near Stillwater Meeting
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> who were married in 1806. Their children's births were recorded in the
                    Stillwater Monthly Meeting book but their marriage was not recorded there. The answer was simple:
                    Stillwater Monthly Meeting was not established until 1808; Stillwater Preparative Meeting was in
                    existence in 1806 and was attached to Concord Monthly Meeting; the marriage in question was recorded
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Concord</settlement>
                    </placeName> Monthly Meeting although consummated in the Stillwater Meeting House. Another point to
                    be remembered is that marriages are recorded in the books of the Monthly Meeting to which the bride
                    belongs.</p>
