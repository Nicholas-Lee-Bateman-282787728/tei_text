                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are

                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag,
                    with the value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All
                    split lines are attributed as "type=I" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for
                    the final portion.</p>

                        dangerous for you to start digging or planting, or making what you want for

                    <p>Ah, that's where the joke comes in. Money is a device for enabling
                            <emph>some</emph> people to get at whatever they want without paying for
                        it.</p>

                    <p>What is paying?</p>

                    <p>Damaging yourself in some way: parting with what you are in need of; enduring
                        something injurious; depriving yourself of health or strength or rest;
                        spending more than your exertions can restore to you; impoverishing your
                            <emph>life</emph> in some way. Money lets <emph>some</emph> people get
                        all they want, and more too, by only damaging <emph>other</emph> people; so
                        that they themselves are not required to pay at all.</p>

                    <p>Oh, but I shouldn’t like to do that. Is there not enough of everything in
                        this great big world for everyone to get at what they are in want of without
                        damaging anyone?</p>

                    <p>Yes; and now-a-days it can all be got at too. But, then, there's not
                            <emph>money</emph> enough to go round; and as I said before, you are
                        bound to get money before you will be <choice>

                        better, for yourself. And if no one <emph>gives</emph> you money which some
                        one else has paid for, you will have to pay for some yourself. But whether
                        you are one of the people who pay damage or no, when<pb xml:id="VAB7048-002"></pb> you have once got money enough away from other people, you can bribe
                        anyone with it to let you have anything else you choose.</p>

                    <p>Well, they have many names. They call themselves “noble” people, and “gentle”
                        people; “upper” people, “higher” people, the “best” people, and so on. They
                        speak of one another’s “majesty,” “highness,” “grace,” “holiness,” and
                        “eminence”; and are addressed as “honorable,” “reverend,” “learned,”
                        “worshipful”; and, in the absence of the other epithets, never miss getting
                        themselves called “respectable.”</p>

                    <p>Their god only knows. (There are three Ms and an N in their god’s name. Aye!
                        And he <emph>is</emph> in the know, too; and “has mercy on them, miserable
                        sinners.”) But they only call themselves by fancy names when money is not
                        being inquired about. When it is, and especially when they are thinking
                        about the man in the street, they call themselves Sovereigns, Legislators,
                        Owners, Employers, Pastors, Masters and Benefactors. And the man in the
                        street is mostly careful to get well out of the way of their
                        carriages‐and‐pairs before he has the cheek to nickname them Bosses,
                        Exploiters, Sweaters, Parasites, Loafers and Frauds. They are all men of
                            <emph>means</emph>, that’s why.</p>

                    <p>The people who don’t. They are called “rich” people, because they get more
                        means than they can use up. They grow tall and live a long time, and are
                        very much respected.</p>

                    <p>They are called “poor” people. They spend their time, strength and ability in
                        making necessaries, comforts and luxuries to give the rich people. They
                        generally die early, and often miserably. They are not at all respected or

                        have bought some money. And without any food or clothing they could not go
                        on spending their time and strength again to‐morrow, and then the rich
                        people would miss their luxuries.</p>

                    <p>One question at a time, please. They <emph>don’t</emph> give in the money
                        where the food and clothes come from. They give the money to some people who
                        have custody of the food and clothing, but who have not made it; and these
                        people give a little of the money to the poor people who <emph>have</emph>
                        made the food and clothes, keeping the rest for themselves. Sometimes the
                        money is handed through several, and what passes on gets less and less, so
                        that the men who buy the last shillings of it with the time and toil which
                        they have spent away in providing the good are, you see, poor men also. This
                        way of going on is called “business.”</p>

                    <speaker>Dunce.—</speaker>
                    <p>Stop! Let me understand. Then you mean to say that some rich folk, whom for
                        clearness I’ll call Strong, Sons &amp; Co., get the full produce of the
                        poor men’s life‐time and life‐strength, and turn it into counters, and then
                        hand back a very few of the counters so that the poor men may have them as
                        tickets for useful stuff for Strong &amp; Co. to‐morrow; and then do you
                        tell me that another lot of rich people, whom we’ll call Rong Brothers
                        &amp; Co., take the tickets as a bribe for the clothes and food, and
                        keep back part of the counters from the other poor men who have made the
                        clothes and food on like terms?</p>

                    <p>Yes, that’s something like how it is. Only you’ve got to recollect that, with
                        Strong, Sons &amp; Co., over the way, insisting upon having everything
                        they can think of for nothing, and forcing <emph>everybody</emph> to take
                        their counters in exchange or go without, Messrs. Rong Brothers &amp;
                        Co. couldn’t live <emph>at all</emph> (let alone live idly or “respectably”)
                        if they did not stop some of the goods from going straight where they are
                        wanted, so as to be able to stop some of the counters coming from the other
                        direction. They then let the goods pass on their way on condition of
                        receiving <emph>more</emph> counters than they gave up in order to get the
                        goods into their custody. What do you think of it all?</p>

                        everybody is made to conform who has not extra money enough to make it worth

                        thing; sometimes it’s another: but it is always whatever this lot of fellows

                        whatever is good for business? And business is the plan of getting most
                        money into the hands of people who pay least? And money is a means by which

                    <p>I say, you’re having a game with me! I’m not such a dunce that I don’t know
                        what “free” means. It doesn’t mean abiding by what you are told, especially
                        when you can’t “abide” the chaps that tell you, nor yet their impudence.
                        Free means exactly the opposite. It means living just how your own
                        give‐and‐take commonsense makes you want to live. It means not being made to
                        toil when you are in want of rest; and it means not being forced to be idle
                        when you want to be at work.</p>

                    <p>Oh, that sort of freedom is only fit for angels and the other lower animals.
                        It may suit beavers and birds and bees all right; but you and I are free
                        citizens, you know, because we can take our chance of choosing
                            <emph>whose</emph> wishes we will conform to. We can have a “Yes,” or
                        “No,” to give to anyone who wants to be a law‐maker; and if a certain number
                        of others choose him too, then he can be one of those whose will will become
                        our law and everyone else’s, that is, of course, if he is one of those who,
                            <emph>by counting heads</emph>, prevails over the others in Parliament.
                        You must see how much freer that makes a citizen than having only himself to
                        consult! And a country may well be called free where nearly everyone can
                        help choose his own law‐master, some one whose head may chance to count up
                        on the right side.</p>

                        help choose whose wishes we’ll conform to (so that business may go on) we
                        all of us at home can have a choice; unless perhaps me, because everyone
                        knows I’m a dunce. My mother and wife and daughter and sons are very sharp

                        what it is, and of keeping the rich people where they are,—that is, in

                        than another has nothing to do with being <emph>free</emph>. But now,

                    <speaker>Other Fellow.—</speaker>
                    <p><emph>Must</emph> choose? Well, there’s nothing to make you choose
                            <emph>anyone</emph> if you don’t want to. And there’s no
                            <emph>reason</emph>, if you come to that, why people who don’t like to
                        spend their lives in working and suffering for the leisure and pleasure of
                        those who take all their means from them, and run the laws to save
                        themselves from being opposed,—no reason <emph>at all</emph> why they should
                        choose anyone. But I suppose they do it because they good‐naturedly believe
                        the man they chooses cares more about them than himself; or because they
                        believe it is good for somebody else even if it isn’t very advantageous for
                        themselves to have to conform to whomsoever wants to have his will made into
                        law. And then, you see, if the poor don’t help choose, they rightly suppose
                        the rich will have all the choosing to themselves; and everything would be
                        more business‐like than ever. For, if you don’t help choose, mark you, you
                        have to conform to what <emph>others</emph> choose, all the same.</p>

                            “<emph>make</emph> you conform,” How’s that? How can you be

                    <speaker>Other Fellow.—</speaker>
                    <p>What I mean by being made to conform is that if it is known that you don’t
                        want to conform you’ll not get employed to help fatten any business man and
                        his covey. And if he don’t want you for his job you’ll starve, just in
                        proportion as you are free and law‐abiding. That is your impersonal,
                        non‐aggressive legal punishment at his hands. And if you really set about
                        going your own way as a man, wherever and whenever you think the law is
                        unfair, the you’ll get a personal and direct punishment. Why, man alive!
                        you’ve heard of “coppers” and police‐courts, and soldiers and bullets and
                        prisons and gallows, eh? You live in the enemy’s country wherever you
                        go.</p>

                    <p>Yes; but even now I can’t imagine how it is possible to get the prisons
                        built, or to find police and soldiers enough to do any particular harm with,
                        if there are so few rich people in comparison with poor people. For, I
                        suppose it is only rich people who care to build prisons or arsenals, or who
                        will care to be coppers or soldiers or hangmen?</p>

                        “receptions,” and “little” dinners, etc., etc., etc. The prison‐builders,
                        and bullet and bomb makers, gallows‐men, soldiers and bobbies are all poor
                        devils like you and me! The rich folk carry out their law against the poor
                        with the help of the poor. If our sort didn’t do it for them, and bully our
                        own sort in favour of the big bugs, then it wouldn’t get done at all,
                        because it <emph>couldn’t</emph>.</p>

                        there, and get themselves made into rich men if they can. Their “honorable”
                        position makes them change their tastes to fit the present system and their

                        “investing.” And they <emph>would</emph> stop investing if Govern‐<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7048-009"></pb> ment couldn’t be trusted to back up business for
                        them, and to leave the control of the land and other capital just where it
                        is. No, no, dunce. Even if it were any good to anyone to have this or that
                        set or class of men forcing their notions on all the rest, there would still
                        be no chance of getting government worked by our sort in our behalf. No need
                        to waste time and energy that way. Everything that really wants doing by
                        arrangements made directly among those able and willing to do it, without
                        any formalities forced on them (with fines attached) by men at a distance
                        not directly concerned in it. Red tape is expensive, mind you, besides
                        tangling everybody’s fingers.</p>

                        any wealth but they are allowed by the law to use up a good deal in exchange
                        for the service they do the Royalties and Law‐and‐War‐makers, Bankers and
                        Stockbrokers, Pleasure‐seekers and loafing Landgrabbers. Their job is to
                        keep the people’s minds dull and quiet, so that they should not make awkward
                        inquiries, and find out how the whole swindle began and what it’s kept going
                        for. They chloroform the people’s wits.</p>

                    <p>Why, by telling them corrupting lies about wrongs and rights, and making out
                        there’s a dreadful curse on people who don’t believe what parsons and
                        priests say, and by keeping them so ignorant that they have no chance of
                        discovering where the lies come in. These lovers of darkness have the
                        decency to dress up in black; it is about the only honest thing they do.
                        They cadge for money to run their music, illuminations, scents, millinery,
                        and entertainments in church—bait for women and children’ and, bock of it
                        all, their job is to <emph>steal a march</emph> on straightforward progress,

                        for wage‐slaves to have. When the people find out what the Church is after,

                    <p>Well, your information has made me feel sure of one thing. Law is only a fine
                        word for coarse, cruel force wrapped up in fraud and cunning. And its only
                        use is to keep up property and to keep rich people easy and unopposed. It is

                <p>Whosoever will be damned, before all things it is necessary that he hold the
                    Capitalistic Faith.</p>
                <p>Which Faith except everyone do keep whole and unqualified, without doubt he shall
                    progress indefinitely.</p>
                <p>And the Capitalistic Faith is this: that we worship one Mammon in Trinity and
                    Trinity in Unity.</p>
                <p>Neither confounding the monopolies nor dividing the substance (especially not
                    dividing the substance).</p>
                <p>For there is one monopoly of the Money‐Bag, another of the Statute, and another
                    of the Holy Church.</p>
                <p>But the Mammon of the Money‐Bag, of the Statute, and of the Holy Church is all
                    one; the vainglory equal, the majesty co‐infernal.</p>
                <p>Such as the Money‐Bag is, such is the Statute, and such is the Holy Church.</p>
                <p>The Money‐Bag indiscriminate, the Statute indiscriminate, and the Holy Church
                    indiscriminate.</p>
                <p>The Money‐Bag indefensible, the Statute indefensible, and the Holy Church
                    indefensible.</p>
                <p>The Money‐Bag infernal, the Statute infernal, and the Holy Church infernal.</p>
                <p>And yet they are not three infernals but one infernal.</p>
                <p>As also there are not three indefensibles, nor three undiscriminated, but one
                    undiscriminated and one indefensible.</p>
                <p>And yet there are not three Almighties but one Almighty.</p>
                <p>So is the Money‐bag a god, the Statute a god, and the Holy Church a god.</p>
                <p>And yet there are not three gods, but one god.</p>
                <p>Likewise the Money‐bag is Law, the Statute is Law, and the Holy Church is
                    Law.</p>
                <p>And yet not three Laws, but one Law.</p>
                <p>For like as we are compelled by the Capitalistic Verity to acknowledge every
                    privileged <choice>
                        <corr></corr>
                        <sic>)</sic>

                        <sic></sic>
                    </choice></p>
                <p>So are we forbidden by the Capitalistic superstition to say there be three Gods,
                    or three Laws.</p>
                <p>The Money‐Bag is made of none, neither needed nor earned.</p>
                <p>The Statute is of the Money‐Bag alone, not earned nor needed, but purchased.</p>
                <p>The Holy Church is of the Money‐Bag and the Statute, neither earned nor needed
                    nor purchased, but resulting.</p>
                <p>So there is one Mammon, not three Mammons; one Statute, not three Statutes; one
                    Holy Church, not three Holy Churches.</p>
                <p>And in this Trinity none is afore or after the other, none is greater or less
                    than another.</p>
                <p>But the whole three Jingoes are co‐infernal together and co‐equal.</p>
                <p>So that in all things as is aforesaid the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in
                    Unity is to be worshipped.</p>
                <p>This is the Capitalistic Faith, which except a man believe faithfully he may
                    possibly be saved.</p>
                <p>Glory be taken from the Money‐Bag, and from the Statute, and from the Holy
                    Church.</p>
                <p>As it was in the beginning so it isn’t now, nor ever will be again. Progress
                    without end. Amen.</p>

                <head>WHO MADE THE CAKE?</head>
                <p>“In the sweat of your brows,” the rich man said, “ye who are useful shall eat
                    your bread. In the sweat of your brows, too—don’t mistake—we pastors and masters
                    will live on cake.” Year in, year out, the sweating was done; they toiled in the
                    factory, toiled in the sun; for the master still left them a daily crust, and
                    the pastor still preached that the text was just. Year in, year out, grew the
                    pile of laws; this point grew weightier, clause by clause, “To him that holdeth
                    shall more be given; from him that yieldeth take all but—heaven.”</p>
                <p>The Lord said, “Sweat of the brow brings bread.” It was something shrewder the
                    landlord said:—“Out of their sweat‐won bread we’ll draw cake for ourselves, and
                    our rights by law.” The parson in preaching quite left that out; the people were
                    foolish and dull, no doubt; but landlords<choice>

                        <sic></sic>
                    </choice> hirelings have such an air when they mount in the pulpit or groan in
                    prayer. They have lived on the fat of the land, you see, by letting the will of
                    the landlord be, and by urging the winners of daily bread to bow to God’s will
                    in all they said.</p>
                <p>Well, a new day dawned, and the people awoke, and found it was only old Mammon
                    who spoke; they examined the swindle that held them fast, and got to the back of
                    the trick at last. The sweat of the patient, toil‐worn brow, buys more than the
                    vouched‐for bread by now. Surely, O world, there’s a sad mistake, for where are
                    the people who made the cake? How are they cared for, how are they fed?

                    make a law, you see, to keep themselves leisurely, merry, and free.</p>
