                <head>PREFACE.</head>
                <p>A<hi rend="sc">FTER</hi> the death of Mr. Harding, many of his friends expressed
                    a wish to have some memorial of him&#151;something that would embalm the
                    flashes of his humor, the nimble wit, the delicate and covert satire of one who,
                    for years, had worked while others slept, until overtaken by that sleep which
                    knows no awakening here. After many doubts and much hesitation, it was decided
                    to publish his army and Mexican letters, and selections from such of his
                    miscellaneous writings as were most characteristic of him, and would best give
                    an idea of the peculiar style and fervor of his genius. His army comrades were
                    especially desirous that his letters, which contained the only really authentic
                    account of the stormy events in which they had taken so active a part, should be
                    published, that justice might be done to their valor, patriotism and endurance.
                    A large part of this volume is, therefore, devoted to this subject. His Mexican
                    Notes were widely read and appreciated, and are herein published in response to
                    many requests. The bulk of his miscellaneous writings was found to be so great
                    as not to be compressible within the limits thus left for it, or, indeed, within
                    a single volume, and it was, therefore, determined to give only some of the more
                    striking.</p>
                <p>Many knew him only as a framer of paragraphs, as a writer <pb id="VAA3891-007"
                        n="2"/> of well rounded sentences, which "shot at folly as it flew," or held
                    a sting for those who conceived and propagated wrong. These, in their very
                    nature, were ephemeral, but it was thought best to preserve a certain portion,
                    that all might be satisfied. To this labor of love has been added a
                    conscientious endeavor to do that alone, which he, had he been living, himself
                    might have approved.</p>

                    <p>G<hi rend="sc">EORGE</hi> C<hi rend="sc">ANADY</hi> H<hi rend="sc"
                            >ARDING</hi> was born near Knox-ville, Tennessee, August 26, 1829. His
                        father, Jacob Harding, was a man of strong mental and physical
                        characteristics, which the son inherited. His mother, whose maiden name was
                        Love F. Nelson, was the daughter of Hon. John R. Nelson, a lawyer of high
                        reputation in that region. She was a woman of small stature, but great force
                        of character. George was the second child in a family of thirteen. He was a
                        quiet, silent boy, given to long solitary rambles, and during his childhood
                        in Tennessee, and his early youth in Illinois, spent much of his time in the
                        woods. He was familiar with the animate and inanimate things of nature, the
                        fauna and flora of that section of country, and knew each individual of
                        them, not indeed, by the names given them in the books, but by their more
                        homely and familiar appellations. He knew where the flowers first bloomed
                        and the berries first ripened. He knew the habits and nesting places of the
                        birds, the haunts and peculiarities of the animals, and even of the insects
                        of the region in which his rambles extended. He became adept in woodcraft,
                        and the use of the <pb id="VAA3891-009" n="4"/> rifle. He was entirely
                        fearless, then and ever after, whether his antagonist were beast or man, or
                        whatever his own weapon. His early habits largely influenced his after life,
                        and tended to make him alert and wary, yet aggressive. When he decided to
                        strike he lost no time about it. The blow was swift and terrible, neither
                        the position, equipment nor strength of his antagonist making the least
                        difference with him. He learned discretion in his later years, but his first
                        impulse always was to spring upon what he conceived to be a wrong or an
                        abuse, and throttle it then and there. George had not reached his teens when
                        his parents removed to Paris, Illinois. His wild ways and swarthy complexion
                        gave him the sobriquet of "The Cherokee," and soon after his arrival at
                        Paris he was compelled to thrash the entire male portion of the school to
                        which he was sent, in order to vindicate his Anglo-Saxon pedigree. This he
                        did so thoroughly that ever thereafter in "choosing sides" for any physical
                        encounter the side that secured "The Cherokee" considered victory already in
                        its grasp. His schooling, however, was limited, and he lost much of the good
                        he might have secured, by his impatience of restraint and contempt for the
                        plodding methods of his teachers. His intuitions were quick and he seemed to
                        know more by instinct than he learned in the books, and had ample time on
                        his hands to devise and execute mischief. He was, moreover, ambitious to
                        assist his father, and having soon learned all the school was likely to
                        teach him, he turned <pb id="VAA3891-010" n="5"/> his attention to the
                        serious business of getting a living. Though only fourteen years of age, he
                        was large and strong, and accepted the best positions that offered, laboring
                        in the harvest field, the brick yard, or wherever he could obtain work. He
                        soon tired of this, and abruptly left home, with a neighbor lad, to make his
                        fortune. He walked all the way to St. Louis, but being out of money and
                        finding the labor market greatly overstocked, he was easily persuaded to
                        return home with a neighbor, who happened to find, him in the city penniless
                        and disheartened. Soon after his return Judge Conrad, of. Terre Haute,
                        offered to take him into the printing office where the <hi rend="i"
                            >Courier</hi> was published, and make a printer of him. To one of young
                        Harding's genius, this settled his career. From setting type to writing for
                        the paper was an easy and natural transition, and his articles always
                        secured attention if they did not carry conviction. Isaac M. Brown, the
                        veteran printer and editor, taught him the art of printing and encouraged
                        him to write. After he had completed his trade, his father abandoned the law
                        and started the <hi rend="i">Prairie Beacon,</hi> at Paris, and George left
                        Terre Haute to assist in the enterprise, and here his literary career began
                        in earnest. Beside writing for the <hi rend="i">Beacon,</hi> he contributed
                        to the Cincinnati "<hi rend="i">Great West,</hi>" and other publications of
                        that sort. His writings then created quite a sensation by their vigorous and
                        incisive style and strong English. Soon after this the Mexican war broke
                        out; he determined to enlist, but failed to get accepted. He <pb
                            id="VAA3891-011" n="6"/> then went to New Orleans on a flat boat, still
                        determined to enlist, but returned to St. Louis without accomplishing his
                        purpose. Here, however, his desire was realized, and he enlisted in the
                        Second Dragoons, but fell sick at Jefferson barracks, and after lying at
                        death's door for some weeks, was discharged. His next experience in
                        editorial life was as editor and half proprietor of the <hi rend="i"
                            >Courier,</hi> at Charleston, Illinois, in which he espoused the cause
                        of Republicanism in the infancy of that party, and did great service in the
                        exciting campaign of 1856. This paper was the first to suggest the name of
                        Fremont for the presidency. After the campaign he withdrew from the <hi
                            rend="i">Courier</hi> and started the <hi rend="i">Ledger,</hi> which
                        attained a large circulation at once, but owing to domestic trouble, Mr.
                        Harding soon disposed of it and went to Cincinnati, where he was engaged for
                        some months on the <hi rend="i">Commercial.</hi> His love for change and
                        excitement, however, soon took him South, and he next appeared as associate
                        editor of the Houston (Texas) <hi rend="i">Telegraph,</hi> tri-weekly. This
                        was just before the outbreak of the civil war. Feeling that a conflict was
                        inevitable, and desiring to be on the right side, he resigned his charge,
                        and came North just before the storm broke. He joined the Twenty-first
                        Indiana regiment (First Heavy Artillery), Col. James W. McMillan, and went
                        with it to Baltimore. His letters to the Cincinnati <hi rend="i"
                            >Commercial</hi> attracted much attention, and were largely instrumental
                        in having the regiment, possessing so able a correspondent, sent to the Gulf
                        Department. His army <pb id="VAA3891-012" n="7"/> letters, which are printed
                        in this volume, with very slight abridgment, attracted great attention, and
                        furnished much valuable data for a history of the war in that quarter. He
                        was promoted from the ranks to be Second Lieutenant, but soon after
                        resigned, and in 1864 took service on the New Orleans <hi rend="i"
                            >Times.</hi> This lasted, however, but six months, and he again came
                        North, and after a short service on the Cincinnati <hi rend="i"
                            >Commercial,</hi> came to Indianapo lis, and entered upon his newspaper
                        career here, which, with one or two brief interruptions, when he was
                        employed upon papers in Louisville and St. Louis, continued till his
                        death&#151;a career which though not uniformly successful in a pecuniary
                        point of view, made him a name and secured him a position of decided
                        eminence in the newspaper world. He was employed at different times and in
                        various capacities, upon the <hi rend="i">Daily Journal,</hi> the <hi
                            rend="i">Daily Herald,</hi> (as the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> was then
                        called) on the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> under the Devlin and Bright
                        administrations, and again on the <hi rend="i">Morning</hi> and <hi rend="i"
                            >Evening Journal.</hi> He started, first the <hi rend="i">Saturday
                            Evening Mirror,</hi> in company with Marshall G. Henry, which was
                        afterwards turned into a daily, and was finally sold to the <hi rend="i"
                            >News.</hi> The <hi rend="i">Mirror</hi> made its mark while it lived,
                        but ambition to become a great daily killed it. His next venture was the <hi
                            rend="i">Saturday Herald,</hi> which he made a great success, but
                        internal dissensions, uncongenial relations with his associates, and failing
                        health, made the position uncomfortable, and he finally sold his interest in
                        the paper and went to Minnesota, hoping that a cessation <pb
                            id="VAA3891-013" n="8"/> from stirring duties, and rest in a salubrious
                        climate, would restore his wonted vigor. His hope was realized, hut with
                        returning health, the dull routine of a country town became irksome, and he
                        longed to re-enter active life. With this object in view, he returned to
                        Indianapolis, and in company with Mr. Charles Dennis, established the <hi
                            rend="i">Saturday Review.</hi> The paper at once attained remarkable
                        popularity and a large circulation. Old friends rallied to his support, and
                        new ones were made with every issue. It was in the full tide of success, and
                        when his prospects never looked brighter, that an accident, slight in itself
                        but fatal in its results, ended his career. An iron grating in a sidewalk
                        raised from below just as he was about to step upon it to make way for some
                        ladies to pass, struck him on the leg, making a slight but painful wound. He
                        paid little attention to it at first, but in a few days he was compelled to
                        take his bed. His wound rapidly grew worse; blood poisoning supervened, and
                        he died in the maturity of his powers and at the height of his usefulness,
                        on May 8, 1881.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Harding's ability as a newspaper writer was of a high order. He used
                        sturdy English in a style noted more for strength than elegance, though none
                        could round a period with more grace. As a paragrapher he had few superiors.
                        He had a rugged, incisive way of putting things that enabled him to throw
                        into a single terse sentence more than the force of a labored editorial. He
                        understood to a nicety the force of reiteration, and week <pb
                            id="VAA3891-014" n="9"/> after week would make the same epigrammatic
                        statement, or ask the same exasperating question in the same exasperating
                        way, until the anticipation of its repetition would become unbearable, and
                        quarter would be sued for on any terms. He was master of the art of
                        retraction, but was seldom called upon to practice it more than once on the
                        same individual, the wrong-doer generally preferring to take his punishment
                        in silence, rather than risk the "correction" he was likely to get if he
                        persisted in demanding it. He cared little for consistency, and never let
                        his record in any case stand in the way of advocating what he at the time
                        believed to be right, or denouncing what he deemed to be wrong. He did not
                        deal in fine phrases, or say pretty things. His character was full of real
                        or apparent contradictions. While he was fearless to the verge of
                        recklessness, he was very gentle to his friends, and keenly sensitive to
                        their opinions, as well as to the opinion of the public. The savage blows he
                        dealt were aimed at abuses, and only incidentally at individuals. Like all
                        strong characters, he was a good hater, but it was the wrong and not the
                        wrong-doer he hated. He had no hypocrisy in his nature, and there was no
                        difficulty in discovering his position on any question. He was naturally of
                        a trusting disposition, but bitter contact with the world made him
                        suspicious of men. To the opposite sex he was gallant and courteous, and
                        held all women to be sincere and honest until proved to the contrary. What
                        he had of egotism was of the grand kind that was satisfied <pb
                            id="VAA3891-015" n="10"/> with itself, and he did not intrude it upon
                        others. His hatred of sham and pretense sometimes made him intolerant, and
                        his restiveness under restraint sometimes carried him beyond the lines of
                        strict decorum. Those who knew him only by his writings, invariably
                        expressed astonishment on becoming acquainted with him, at the gentleness of
                        his nature. He did not seem to realize the tremendous force with which he
                        dealt a blow, and would meet his writhing victim with a suavity that was
                        more exasperating than the attack. Many whose introduction to him was a
                        cruel thrust of his blade, if they came to demand an apology, didn't get it,
                        but with such a mild mannered grace that they became his fast friends.</p>
                    <p>In the strength of his earlier years Mr. Harding seemed perfectly tireless,
                        and would pursue a wrong or an adversary with a persistence bordering on
                        ferocity. In those years his attitude was that of a tiger ready for a
                        spring. Time and sad experience greatly softened his nature, and while he
                        still remained a dangerous foe, he was less aggressive and slower to anger.
                        He no longer fought for the mere love of it, but wrote and acted from a
                        sense of responsibility resting upon him as a public journalist. His last
                        years were his best, and there was more of conscience, dignity, and a just
                        appreciation of accountability for the use of his talents than had been
                        manifested in previous years. His heart and pen were enlisted on the side of
                        the saving forces of society, and while he still hated cant and hypocrisy
                        with all the strength of his <pb id="VAA3891-016" n="11"/> nature, he was
                        more tolerant of honest difference of opinion. He was greatly respected by
                        the country press, and he did much to infuse into it a manly spirit of
                        emulation, if also of antagonism, by example as well as by inducing a
                        wholesome fear of castigation. His capacity for work was great, and all that
                        he heard or read was retained in such available shape as to be ready for use
                        on the instant. It is told of him, while he was an attache of the New
                        Orleans <hi rend="i">Times,</hi> that late one night when the forms were
                        ready for press, and his associates, as well as the printers, had gone home,
                        he heard of a vessel just arrived from Cuba with papers containing an
                        account of a rebellion in progress on the island. These papers were printed
                        in Spanish, and he knew little or nothing of the language. No translator was
                        to be had at that hour of the night, but he secured the papers, hunted up an
                        Anglo-Spanish dictionary somewhere, ordered the newspaper forms to be held
                        open for an hour, and in that short space of time succeeded in translating
                        and putting in type himself, a very accurate and readable account of the
                        affair, the <hi rend="i">Times</hi> being the only paper that had any
                        allusion to it next morning.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Harding was twice married. His first wife was Miss Jennie Reeves, of
                        Oberlin, Ohio, to whom he was married in 1856, and by whom he had two
                        children, both now dead. This marriage was very unfortunate and unhappy, and
                        ended in divorce. His only daughter, Flora, inherited much of her father's
                        genius, and for a time assisted him <pb id="VAA3891-017" n="12"/> in his
                        work. Her early death, and the circumstances surrounding it, form one of the
                        saddest pictures in his life; and his eulogy of her, and his scathing
                        denunciation of her betrayer, was at once the strongest and most pathetic of
                        his writings. His second marriage was to Miss Julia C. Bannister, and took
                        place in Cincinnati, in July, 1861. Five sons were born of this union, the
                        eldest of whom is now eighteen years of age. They bear a strong family
                        resemblance to their father, and it is believed inherit his genius in a
                        great degree.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Harding was domestic in his tastes, and needed the quiet pleasures of
                        home, though his busy and eventful life gave him little opportunity to enjoy
                        them. While he was strong in his affections, he was not demonstrative,
                        reticence being one of the leading traits in his character. In personal
                        appearance he was always striking. Of large physical dimensions, and erect
                        bearing, he was a man to attract attention. His complexion was dark and his
                        hair jet black. His eyes were dark and very expressive, lighting up in the
                        most kindly and captivating manner, or burning like fire brands in anger.
                        His voice was low and pleasing. In his later years, when his hair and
                        mustache became gray, the lines of his features more sharply defined, and
                        the contour of his grand head was more plainly visible, he was a man to be
                        singled out in a crowd for distinguished appearance.</p>
                    <p>He had many enemies but more friends. He was not always right, but a summing
                        up of his work will show a large balance on the right side.</p>

                            of sailing. Some passengers had been waiting and swearing for ten days
                            at the hotels. It was finally noised about that the chief engineer was
                            putting in a new "cross head," and it was this which was detaining the
                            steamer. None of us had the slightest idea what a cross head was, but it
                            was learnedly discussed, and various wise opinions as to the danger of
                            putting to sea with a worm-eaten cross head indulged. Every day some new
                            arrival would make a pilgrimage to the steamer landing near Jackson
                            Square, seek an interview with the engineer, and ask as a particular
                            favor to be shown the new cross head, in order that he might be enabled
                            to judge, by ocular observation, as to its capacity for resisting the
                            heavy chop <pb id="VAA3891-019" n="14"/> seas of the gulf. Poor Miller's
                            life was made a burden to him.</p>
                        <p>The captain, the purser, the first and second officer, the steward, the
                            agent and the agent's clerks and errand boys, who had in turn all been
                            bedeviled to the very verge of distraction by the questions and
                            grumblings of delayed passengers, found in Miller's cross head a
                            capacious scape-goat, and they took a diabolical pleasure in referring
                            all grievances to him. Mr. Miller is a patient, scientific,
                            long-suffering gentleman. While in the blockade-running service during
                            the late war, plying between Nassau and Charleston, he invented a
                            smoke-burner, which enabled the blockade-runners to use soft coal, and
                            burn up the long trail which would otherwise have enabled our cruisers
                            to hunt them down. He is the only man who ever successfully crossed the
                            gulf in the tempestuous month of March with a wooden boiler. He speaks
                            Spanish like oil, and is in many respects a valuable acqui-sition to our
                            merchant marine; but that cross head was too much for him. He stood it
                            for five days and then disappeared, and was seen no more until the
                            gangway was hoisted in previous to the ship's sailing. On arrival at
                            Tampico he was still further infuriated by the pirate who commanded the
                            lighter La Fortuna, calling out to him as soon as he got within hail,
                            "Have you got that cross head all right?" The fact that it was he who
                            was keeping the ship back with his new-fangled cross head, had been
                            telegraphed ahead by way of Matamoras.</p>

                        <p>New Orleans is pretty much as it used to be. It is not quite so
                            distinctive as before the war, and much more so than before the collapse
                            of the carpet-bag system of organized robbery. Signs of returning
                            prosperity are apparent. There are also innovations. The fashionable
                            drinking and loafing has moved further down (or up) in the neighborhood
                            of the St. Charles Hotel, and the square which includes the St. Charles
                            Theater, "Murphy's," The "Ph&#156;nix," and other historic places,
                            no longer presents the gay appearance it did twenty years ago. Indeed,
                            it begins to look shabby, if not positively low. But New Orleans still
                            presents the same show of handsome men and ugly women; the same big
                            oysters, big tumblers and frequent drinks; the same free-and-easy
                            disregard of fashion plates in masculine dress; the same singing,
                            good-humored waves of people who ebb and flow through the portals of the
                            drinking saloons, with no other apparent mission in life save eating and
                            drinking and smoking. The size of the glasses is a marvel to a Northern
                            man. It makes him feel as if he were taking a drink out of a churn, and
                            until he acquires a little experience he is apt to overgauge his nips.
                            Your fiery Southron scorns anything that looks like restriction in his
                            social horns, and as an indignant reaction against the small, thin
                            glasses of the northern drinking house, has secured a vessel which
                            admits of a horn that would impoverish a feeble establishment. Everybody
                            drinks, and drinks early and often.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3891-021" n="16"/>
                        <p>The "lunches" at the fashionable houses which throng St. Charles street
                            are in fact elaborate meals, with soups, and roasts, and salads that
                            would do honor to the <hi rend="i">chef de cuisine</hi> of a Paris
                            restaurant, and clean plates and knives and forks for each course. I try
                            in vain to ascertain upon what solid basis all this eating and drinking
                            rests. The Texas trade and the Red river trade have gone glimmering.</p>
                        <p>Of manufacturing there seems to be little or nothing. I strolled around
                            to the Cotton Exchange, and detected a half hundred rosy-faced and
                            round-bellied gentlemen apparently engaged in talking business, but
                            their business was so frequently interrupted with adjournments to
                            "Hawkins'" that it was hard to determine whether business or brandy
                            predominated. I wandered into legislative halls in the old St. Louis
                            Hotel, and listened for a brief half hour to the monotonous drone of
                            legislation, which is the same yesterday, to-day and forever in all
                            localities. There were the same pert clerks, with an insufferable air of
                            knowing things, and unmistakable indications of a propensity to lobby;
                            the same disposition on the part of the members to loll and cock up
                            their feet; in short, the same characteristics which sweeten the halls
                            of legislation in our own beloved Indiana. The colored brother is not
                            quite so numerous as he used to be, but still is an important factor in
                            Louisiana statesmanship. It amused me to see how quickly the colored
                            members had caught up the little tricks and subterfuges of the average
                            lawmaker, by <pb id="VAA3891-022" n="17"/> which he impresses the
                            feeble-minded spectator with an idea of his eternal vigilance.</p>
                        <p>For instance, the clerk was reading some stupid resolution touching some
                            trifling matter about which nobody knew anything&#151;about which
                            nobody cared anything. A colored member, who had been leaning back in
                            his chair looking at the ceiling through half-closed eyelids, and lazily
                            blowing smoke-wreaths from a half-consumed cigar, pricks up his ears as
                            the drone of the reading clerk's voice dies away, and rising asks for
                            the reading of the paper again, as he is not quite sure that he has
                            caught its exact meaning. The clerk drones through the dreary document
                            again, telescoping the words in a manner even more unintelligible than
                            before, but the colored member is satisfied, and relapses into his
                            dreamy study of the ceiling and smoke-rings again. He has vindicated his
                            character as the Barking Watch-Dog of Grenouille parish. They can't
                            secrete anything to the detriment of his constituents in the bowels of
                            an apparently harmless resolution without his digging it out, you bet. I
                            had seen the same thing done so often in the riotous halls of our own
                            dear defunct State House, that I felt like embracing the Watch-Dog.
                            Lovely woman seems to be emerging from her conservative chrysalis in New
                            Orleans&#151;a fact due to the contamination of northern influences.
                            Twenty-five years ago the intensely respectable Creole element
                            considered it equivalent to a loss of reputation for a woman to be seen
                            upon the streets without an escort, even at mid-day. Now Canal <pb
                                id="VAA3891-023" n="18"/> street is constantly thronged with gay
                            butterflies of fashion, and even the Creole girl, with her
                            fuller's-earth complexion and her sombre dress, is allowed to go out
                            without a duenna or sheep-dog. (A Creole is not a person of mixed blood,
                            O, obstinate reader! but a native of Louisiana, born of foreign
                            parentage). Loafing about the St. Charles barroom, I see the same faces
                            and forms which ornamented the locality twenty-seven years
                            ago&#151;men with long hair, greasy complexions, red noses, and
                            emitting that unmistakable aura which marks the genteel Southern loafer.
                            Certainly they are not the same men. The men I knew then have long since
                            died of drink and smoke, but the type has been perpetuated. In other
                            quarters I find representatives of a still lower type of loaferdom,
                            whose appearance is very familiar. I could almost swear that that
                            forlorn loafer leaning against the lamppost at the corner of Commercial
                            Place and St. Charles street, with the gray-bleached hat, dirty ruffled
                            shirt, and general air of limp slouchiness, is Johnny Pie, but I know
                            that Johnny died of yellow fever a quarter of a century ago. This fellow
                            is lying in ambush for a drink, just as Johnny used to, and the family
                            resemblance is strong. And that rotund, seedy little fellow who walks
                            with a jaunty assumption of a business air, and despite his shabbiness
                            is self-assertive to the extent of commanding a degree of respect from
                            the bar-keeper, who already has an antique score of great length against
                            him, is the exact counterpart of Banana Dick, who went out with the
                            liberating army of <pb id="VAA3891-024" n="19"/> Lopez, and had his
                            cervical vertebræ dislocated by a twist of the Spanish garrote.</p>
                        <p>The cross-head is at last in; Miller and the ship's cat come aboard from
                            their places of concealment; the passengers and their baggage are taken
                            in; the gun fires, and the City of Mexico, swinging out into the stream,
                            points for the Southwest Pass, under a full head of steam. As she makes
                            her way down the river the passengers scrape acquaintance. Mr. Arnold
                            Winholt, an English gentleman who has seen the great wall of China, and
                            nearly everything else on the habitable globe that is worth seeing,
                            having stowed away his cork hat, remembers having sat at the same table
                            with us at the St. Charles, and having by the attrition of travel worn
                            away the Englishman's insular prejudices, falls an easy prey to our
                            advances. He apologizes for a slight indistinctness of enunciation on
                            account of a dental operation which Dr. West had performed upon one of
                            his front teeth. The tooth had been imperfectly "stopped" by an English
                            bungler. Dr. West had persuaded him to have it extracted, properly
                            filled and replanted. He was incredulous. The doctor piled Pelion upon
                            Ossa in the way of authority, and at last he consented. The operation
                            had been performed several days previous, and the doctor had fastened
                            the tooth in its place with an apparatus which interfered with his
                            talking. Everything seemed&#151;he said it "in all humility, "for he
                            was a little superstitious about premature boasting&#151;to be going
                            on well, and he had faith that the replanted tooth <pb id="VAA3891-025"
                                n="20"/> would take firm root. American dentists, he said, are
                            confessedly the best dentists in the world, and if Dr. West only saved
                            his tooth he would consider the ten pounds invested in the experiment as
                            well spent. The acquaintance thus made with this accomplished English
                            gentleman, who became our companion through Mexico, proved invaluable to
                            us in the way of instruction and amusement. On the steamer we also found
                            Dr. Harris, an American dentist, who located in the City of Mexico
                            twenty-seven years ago, and his accomplished daughter Anna, the two
                            being on their return from a visit to the States. We were indebted to
                            them for many kind offices.</p>
                        <p>Other people have been to sea and told about it. All the glowing things
                            have been said about the waves, and illimitable vastness of a landscape
                            which embraces nothing but blue water and blue sky. All the funny things
                            have been said about sea-sickness. Everybody has been told about the
                            fellow who for the first hour was in mortal fear that the ship would go
                            down, and in the next despondingly feared that it wouldn't. I will
                            forbear. To me the sea is a great, big, disgusting fact, without the
                            relief of sea-sickness. If there is any poetry in sailing the salt seas
                            over, it is to be found in a wind-jammer. A steamer is a hybrid
                            subterfuge&#151;a big, black, overgrown critter, which is unable to
                            stand up in a fair fight with the elements, but holds steadily to its
                            course by the aid of coal, in spite of weather. The City of Mexico, the
                                <pb id="VAA3891-026" n="21"/> oldest and smallest of the Alexandre
                            line, is a staunch little craft, with an undeserved reputation as a high
                            roller. It is true that occasionally an unwary passenger, sitting on the
                            bench behind the lee railing, will have the seat of his pantaloons
                            treated to a cooling salt water bath, even when the vessel is light and
                            standing twenty feet out of water; but this is not much of a roll to an
                            old sailor. Captain McIntosh is a thorough sailor and a perfect
                            gentleman withal. Everybody put in an appearance at the supper table
                            just before we crossed the bar. The next morning there was plenty of
                            room, and the waiters were not overworked. It is a singular and
                            exasperating fact that aboard of all steamships the rule is five "eats"
                            a day, while sea-sickness generally keeps two-thirds of the passengers
                            from taking more than one square meal between ports. To those who keep
                            up the various meals it seems to break the monotony of the day and help
                            to speed the laggard hours. Our voyage was uneventful in an
                            extraordinary degree. There was a fair wind and gentle sea for the most
                            of the time, balmy weather and moonlight nights, which those who were
                            not sea-sick enjoyed by sitting on deck and watching the wake of silver
                            which the vessel left astern as she plowed her way through the dark blue
                            water.</p>
                        <p>Tampico was the first event. The ship anchored six or eight miles out.
                            Through a glass a few church spires and domes of the city were visible,
                            but the outlook was mostly a cheerless outline of sandy coast with
                            mountains in the distance and an <pb id="VAA3891-027" n="22"/> angry
                            surf breaking over the bar at the mouth of the river. It is a disgusting
                            fact that there is not a decent harbor on the Atlantic coast of Mexico.
                            Ships anchor away off from the shore, and discharge their cargos in
                            lighters. If a Norther is blowing, and it generally is, the ship can't
                            anchor, but must cut for blue water again. So it frequently happens that
                            freight for Tampico and Tuxpan is carried from New Orleans to Vera Cruz
                            and back a dozen times before it can be delivered. There happened to be
                            a good bar, and soon after we had anchored," La Fortuna," commanded by
                            as fine a looking pirate as ever scuttled a ship or cut a throat, and
                            another lighter were soon at our side, receiving empty barrels to be
                            returned with honey, cases of wine and brandy, iron for crowbars to be
                            used in the mines, and other freight, while a number of smaller boats,
                            containing passengers, fruits, vegetables, etc., bobbed up and down at
                            the ship's sides, everybody chattering mixed Spanish and Indian. Many of
                            them shinned up the side of the vessel and came aboard. One brown
                            fellow, with a broad foot, an immense vacant space between the big toe
                            and its nearest neighbor, and not much clothes on, had a squeaking
                            parrot which he was anxious to dispose of for <hi rend="i">circo
                                pesos.</hi> Being told that it was too much, he threw out a
                            challenge for an offer. I was on the point of offering him four bits,
                            but forbore for fear the infernal bird should be left on my hands. It
                            isn't safe to make any sort of an offer to these seaport Mexicans unless
                            you mean business. A monkey also came on board, but it was <pb
                                id="VAA3891-028" n="23"/> not for sale, being intended "for the
                            General." There was a stinking wild cat in a box which followed us to
                            the hotel at Vera Cruz, and in an adjoining compartment accompanied us
                            on the railroad as far as Cordova. While the Fortuna was taking in her
                            cargo, and her pirate captain and half-naked crew were all talking at
                            once, I put in an interested half hour in watching the process of making
                            an olla-podrida for the dinner of the crew. The artist was a
                            bright-eyed, active lad of about ten years. An iron pot was simmering
                            over a small charcoal fire, built on a portable hearth, and into this
                            the little fellow dropped at intervals potatoes, plantains with their
                            skins on, beans, shreds of cabbage, bits of pumpkin, tomatoes, a few
                            cloves, now and then an onion, and a piece of garlic. The pot also
                            contained some bits of ragged meat, either sheep or ox. The little
                            fellow was very cleanly, and seemed to take a lively interest in his
                            work. He darted in and out of the hatch hole, and every now and then
                            peeped into the pot to see that the requisite degree of simmer was kept
                            up without approaching a positive boil.</p>
                        <p>By and by it seemed to have progressed to a point where it demanded the
                            finishing touches. A large pod of chile mulata, the mildest species of
                            the chile family, had been soaking in an earthen bowl until it had
                            colored the water a dark brown. The young Soyer now took a half dozen
                            cloves of garlic and a spoonful of the seeds of the chile mulata, <pb
                                id="VAA3891-029" n="24"/> put them in another dish, and with a stone
                            pestle ground them into a paste. Then he poured the contents of the
                            other bowl into this one, thoroughly mixed, and turned the mess into the
                            steaming pot. A few moments more of simmering and the podrida was an
                            accomplished fact. It looked good. An intimation that we would like to
                            try it was cheerfully responded to. A rope was lowered and a small
                            bucket of stuff was hoisted up. We all tasted, and all pronounced it
                            good. The bucket was sent back with some silver pieces, which the young
                            monkey pocketed with a polite "mil gracias senores." Several passengers,
                            who came off in small boats, were hoisted on board in a chair. The women
                            hid their faces in making the giddy ascent, and bit their lips hard to
                            repress a shriek; the babies squalled loudly, and the boys kicked and
                            laughed in making the ascent. Leaving Tampico the next morning (Sunday),
                            we anchored in front of Tuxpan. The scenery was very much like that of
                            Tampico&#151;an invisible town in the distance, a river and an angry
                            bar upon which the surf was lashing itself to fury. It was a bad bar,
                            and three lighters had gone ashore in the effort to come off to the
                            ship. The "Juanita" (Litttle John) had succeeded in getting safely over
                            the bar, at the expense of a thorough drenching of the crew, and lay
                            alongside, where these unsophisticated children of nature drew off the
                            drawers of unbleached cotton, which was their only nether garment, and
                            calmly proceeded to wring the salt water from their saturated shirts in
                            the presence <pb id="VAA3891-030" n="25"/> of the "passenjaire," male
                            and female after their kind. While lying at Tuxpan, we first began to
                            hear of that winter terror of the gulf, the Norther. A long, low bank of
                            misty clouds gathered at the horizon's edge, and soon we saw the
                            natives, and our own sailors pointing significantly at it. "What is it,"
                            I inquired of Captain McIntosh. "Only a Norther coming," he replied.</p>
                        <p>As it happened we ran away from our Norther, and for this once was spared
                            the pleasure of its company. In the night we passed close to the wreck
                            of the City of Havana, the most beautiful, the swiftest and the finest
                            vessel of the Alexandre line, which was wrecked on one of the dreadful
                            coral reefs which make this coast so dangerous. Capt. Phillips, a
                            thorough seaman, and a sober, careful, but over confident man, was
                            steaming along on a fine moonlight night, with the sea as smooth as
                            glass, when he met his fate. Shutting up his glass, he said, "In an hour
                            we will be in Tuxpan." The words were scarcely out of his mouth when his
                            beautiful vessel was firmly imbedded in the saw-teeth of the reef. He
                            lost his place, and shame and grief, it is said, have made him a maniac.
                            A little before daylight we are on deck to catch the first glimpse of
                            the lights of Vera Cruz, one of which flashes forth its friendly rays
                            from the tower on the Castle of San Juan, while the other shines from a
                            church steeple in the city. We go to bed, sleep a little, get up and
                            find our good ship rounding into the harbor between the city and the
                            castle. The sea is smooth, the <pb id="VAA3891-031" n="26"/> sky blue,
                            and the city of the True Cross lies before us, tranquilly stinking in
                            the sunshine, while from the misty clouds that veil the mountain range
                            gleams the white grandeur of Orizaba's peak.</p>

                        <p>V<hi rend="sc">ERA</hi> C<hi rend="sc">RUZ,</hi> from the steamer's
                            anchorage under the walls of the castle, a mile or more from shore,
                            presents an imposing appearance. (There is but one more beautiful view
                            of it to be had, and that is from the stern of the homeward-bound
                            steamer as she goes out.) While the boats of the water-men are gathering
                            about the vessel, their owners clamoring for the honors and emoluments
                            of safely landing passengers and luggage on the <hi rend="i">mole,</hi>
                            we take a long look at the yellow, flat-roofed houses, the quaint wall
                            which encloses the city proper, and the glittering sand-hills in the
                            rear. Dr. Harris, who speaks Spanish as if he really enjoyed it,
                            chaffers with a bare-legged pirate, and finally engages him to take five
                            of us ashore for fifty cents a head. It was in the pirate's mind to ask
                            two dollars a head, but the doctor's fluent Spanish "rattled" him, and
                            he came down to hard-pan on his first bid. The readiness with which it
                            was accepted has cast a gloom over his entire life. It will be a matter
                            of undying regret to him that he <pb id="VAA3891-032" n="27"/> didn't
                            ask a dollar, even if he had to come down to fifty cents. We descend the
                            ship's ladder, get into the "bota grande," whose beauties our pirate
                            friend has so poetically eulogized, and are rowed toward the shore. The
                            "bota grande" is a clumsy but rather stoutly-built craft, painted blue.
                            Its only claim to grandeur in its interior decoration is a strip of
                            faded plush with which the stern seat is cushioned. A smell of fish
                            inspires the suspicion that quite recently it has been engaged in the
                            pursuits which kept the apostles in bread and oil previous to the time
                            when they began studying for the ministry. The <hi rend="i">mole</hi> is
                            a wide causeway of dark stone, which extends several hundred feet out
                            into the water. Stone stairways, at intervals, lead down to the water's
                            edge for the convenience of the disembarking passenger. It is an easy
                            matter in this trifling sea, but at times getting ashore is rather
                            exciting to a person of weak nerves. It is quiet enough now. A loafing
                            pelican, which seems to be a sort of harbor pet, takes lazy little
                            flights, and returns again to its favorite foraging place. A half dozen
                            semi-amphibious boys, naked from the waist up, are bathing in the clear
                            water, and the <hi rend="i">mole</hi> is thronged with people. We slide
                            smoothly through the clutches of the custom-house officers, who scarcely
                            make a pretense of opening our modest valises. Upon a demijohn of old
                            Bourbon, taken along for the purpose of making American residents in
                            Mexico homesick, is focused the suspicious gaze of the <hi rend="i"
                                >pratico.</hi> "What is that?" he <pb id="VAA3891-033" n="28"/>
                            finally inquires. "Hypercoon," replied Mr. P. The official looked
                            puzzled. He inquired its use, and Mr. P. went through the motions of
                            taking a snifter. "For yourself?" he continued; "is it good?" On being
                            told that it was, the official "smiled," and told us to pass. He
                            evidently has a favorable opinion of the drinking capacity of the
                            average American citizen.</p>
                        <p>All the vexatious preliminaries settled, our baggage at the depot, we
                            five sat down to a cheerful breakfast in the capacious dining room of
                            the Hotel Veracruzano. Said dining room was on the ground floor, with
                            the public bar in front. From the rafters hang a score or more of
                            "Kingan's Reliable" hams in their yellow covers, and we are prouder than
                            ever of Indianapolis enterprise. Ham, however, is a luxury to which the
                            regular boarder at $2.50 per day must not aspire&#151;a waiter who
                            speaks fluent English volunteering the explanation that "hammy too
                            high." We eat our breakfast of soup, eggs, fish, various meats and
                            delicious fruits, with the strong black coffee of the country, and
                            pronounce it good. Our English friend, who has a critical palate,
                            detects the flavor of the Spanish wine in the claret, but is too
                            good-humored to grumble. And then we go out to see the town.</p>
                        <p>If one could trust his eyes, Vera Cruz is a cleanly city. Its paved
                            streets are swept every night; not a speck of dust is to be seen; not a
                            bit of litter is to be found anywhere. This appearance of public
                            cleanliness, coming as it does upon <pb id="VAA3891-034" n="29"/> the
                            recollection of the horrible filth through which our Indianapolis belles
                            draggle their skirts, almost convinces us that Vera Cruz has been foully
                            slandered. But unfortunately at this moment the nose comes in with a
                            mass of rebutting testimony which impeaches the credibility of the eyes.
                            As before stated, Vera Cruz is a walled town, with bastion forts at
                            either extremity of the shore front. The city was founded by the
                            Spaniards in 1519, a short distance from the present site, and called
                            Villa Rica de Vera Cruz&#151;the rich city of the true cross. It was
                            in a few years removed to the mouth of the Antigua, and again removed to
                            its present site in 1590. The wall is built of coral limestone, and is
                            six feet high, three feet thick, and pierced at intervals for musketry.
                            The city contains about 10,000 population inside the walls, and probably
                            as many more outside. It has the massive, monotonous architecture for
                            which the Spaniards in their days of manhood were noted&#151;heavy
                            walls, stuccoed with cement and stained yellow, pink or blue; flat
                            roofs, paved with heavy square bricks, or tiles, and windows heavily
                            grated with iron, giving each house the appearance of a combined
                            fortress and prison. In the city wall and walls of the houses, in the
                            pavements and loose stones, you find the most beautiful formations of
                            coral, and are duly impressed with the industry of the amazing insect
                            which threw up these abominable reefs from the bottom of the sea, and
                            created abundant material for the building of an entire city. Water from
                            a neighboring stream has been conveyed to the city <pb id="VAA3891-035"
                                n="30"/> and has been plentifully distributed. Through the center of
                            many of the streets there runs a tiny streamlet, which serves to convey
                            the liquid slops to the Gulf. The <hi rend="i">zapillotes</hi>
                            (buzzards) are a common feature of Mexican life in the hot lands. In
                            Vera Cruz they swarm like flies. The zapillote is smaller than our
                            buzzard, neat and trim in its appearance, but nevertheless a buzzard of
                            the straitest sect.</p>
                        <p>They sit on the domes of the churches and the roofs of the houses in
                            black clouds, and wade in the little streams of milky slop that trickle
                            through the streets, grubbing for such garbage as is available for food.
                            You have to almost kick them out of the way. They turn their bright eyes
                            on you as you pass, and are quick to escape a threatening gesture,
                            though too lazy to get out of the way for a mere feint. A garbage cart
                            will be covered with them until nothing of the cart or its contents is
                            visible&#151;all scrambling for the food to be found in the mess.
                            They vacate the cart when the driver comes out of the house with a fresh
                            bucket of slop, and take convenient position in the street, but no
                            sooner is his back turned than they mount again, and renew their
                            investigations. These buzzards are the scavengers of Vera Cruz, but,
                            like all public servants, they find republics at times ungrateful. Just
                            now a heavy fine protects them from injury or even insult, but it has
                            not been long since the <hi rend="i">ayuntamiento</hi> (I believe that
                            is what they call the honorable body which is analagous to our city
                            council) took it into their wise heads that the buzzards <pb
                                id="VAA3891-036" n="31"/> were a relic of barbarism, and offended
                            the aesthetic sense of the casual visitor. So they set a price upon
                            their heads&#151;a good round price at that&#151;and they were
                            slain by thousands. The hunters brought them in by the hundred, the
                            authorities paid the stipulated two reals per head for them, and then
                            the carcasses were carted down and thrown into the Gulf. The boys, with
                            an ingenuity worthy of a better cause, gathered them up again, and
                            continued to present them for redemption as long as they were in a
                            presentable condition. They bankrupted the treasury, but the city was
                            pretty well cleared of buzzards. That year it could be smelled as far
                            out to sea as Lobos island, and the yellow fever was worse than ever. So
                            the next change of administration restored the buzzards to favor, and
                            here they are. A one-legged veteran of the ornithological St.
                            Bartholomew draws a pension. He hops about the streets with agile grace,
                            and is allowed privileges denied his unmutilated brethren on account of
                            his misfortune. The fickleness of the Vera Cruz city government is
                            manifested in other matters than its buzzard policy. The fate of the
                            city wall often trembles in the balance. In time of revolution the gates
                            are closed, and getting in and out is embarrassing. Besides, many think
                            that the wall makes the fever worse by keeping off the winds. So there
                            is every now and then a movement to have it torn down. The magnificent
                            track of the railroad, built out in the water at great expense for the
                            purpose of facilitating the discharge of merchandise from vessels, <pb
                                id="VAA3891-037" n="32"/> is another monument of Mexican fickleness
                            or perfidy. The government calmly permitted the company to build it, and
                            then notified them that they couldn't use it. The reason given is not a
                            novel one. We have heard it before, even in enlightened Columbia, the
                            land of the free, etc. They said it would take the bread out of the
                            working-men's mouths. It was the same argument that was urged in the
                            peanut war at Erie some twenty years ago, when the proposed change of
                            railroad gauge to a uniform width, so as to avoid the delay and expense
                            of transfer, created a riot. It is also the same argument which our
                            workingmen employ to discourage the employment of Chinamen. Whether it
                            is cheap steam or cheap human labor, the principle is the same, and it
                            is one that would blindly resist every labor-saving invention.</p>
                        <p>Vera Cruz has its plaza, as has every other Spanish town. It is a
                            delightful little garden spot, where you sit under the cocoa palms and
                            listen to the chatter of the daws, while the plash of the fountain falls
                            in gentle cadence on the ear. There are beautiful flowers, pleasant
                            seats, an atmosphere that is almost sultry, strange sights and sounds
                            all around you, and everything to make a realization of the fact that it
                            is the middle of January, almost impossible. The daws, or magpies, or
                            whatever they are, interest me greatly. At first they seem to be the
                            crow blackbird of our temperate zone, but closer investigation shows
                            that they are larger and glossier, and if any additional evidence were
                            needed, their voices are sufficient. <pb id="VAA3891-038" n="33"/> They
                            occasionally emit the harsh "chack" of our blackbird, but have an
                            abundance of other tones, clear and musical. They alight at your feet,
                            turn their bright eyes, almost human in their intelligence, on you, with
                            a quizzical expression, as if anxious to know what you are going to do
                            about it. These birds are carnivorous. They will steal a mutton chop or
                            beef bone, fly with it into a neighboring tree, and tear it in fine
                            style. Speaking of birds reminds me that there is not such a thing as a
                            devil-sling in all Mexico. Wherever I have gone, birds of all kinds have
                            manifested little fear of man or boy. An American boy in the plaza of
                            Vera Cruz, armed with his favorite devil-sling, would find it a paradise
                            indeed.</p>
                        <p>Just across the way from the plaza is the Hotel of the Diligences, a
                            favorite loafing place for foreigners and natives. They sit outside of
                            the cafe, under the portal, drinking coffee, cognac and seltzer, or
                            whatever they may choose, and smoking the cigars of the country, which
                            are very good and very cheap. On each table is a little brazier with
                            lighted charcoal, for renewing the cigars. The Latin races are generally
                            poor drinkers. With plenty of light wine, and a little <hi rend="i">eau
                                sucre</hi> or cordial now and then, and an occasional thimble-full
                            of cognac, they can rub along. But Vera Cruz is an exception to the
                            rule. It would be considered a hard-drinking city, even in the United
                            States. The glasses are a third larger even than those of New Orleans. A
                            short life and a merry one seems to be the rule with the Veracruzanos,
                            and the <pb id="VAA3891-039" n="34"/> amount of tobacco they burn and
                            brandy they destroy is a subject of wonderful remark all over Mexico.
                            There is little of the extreme poverty which is visible in the interior.
                            Yellow Jack protects the people already acclimated from competition.
                            Annually, there comes from the interior a few score of young men of all
                            conditions, to make their fortunes, and annually the bronze devil
                            gathers them in.</p>
                        <p>As we sit in the plaza our English friend, who has a mania for laying
                            small wagers on quaint events, proposes to bet that within five minutes
                            from a given time ten men will not pass between the arches of the portal
                            directly opposite before one woman does. Mr. P. takes the bet. One, two,
                            three, five, eight men are scored, and it seems that our English friend
                            is booked to lose, when an old woman, very drunk and very dirty, comes
                            staggering along and changes the prospect. The odds are two to one in
                            favor of "the Colonel," as we have dubbed our Englishman, when the woman
                            stops to look at some lottery tickets, and while she is selecting a
                            lucky number two swaggering sailors, arm in arm, pass under the arches,
                            and the Englishman loses. Mr. P. then proposes to bet that ten women
                            will pass between two arches of the portal on the other side of the
                            square before five men do, but, as that road leads directly to the
                            cathedral, in which services are being held, the colonel declines.</p>
                        <p>We finally fell into the tide of people that seemed to be flowing into
                            the cathedral, and entered <pb id="VAA3891-040" n="35"/> that sacred
                            structure. It was on the occasion of the bishop's visit, and Vera Cruz,
                            which is not nearly so devout a city as its name would indicate, had
                            turned out almost <hi rend="i">en masse</hi> to absorb religion enough
                            to tide it over the spring season. Every fond mother, and they were of
                            all colors and conditions, many of them guiltless of the sacred circlet
                            which testifies to the legality of love, had brought her infant to
                            receive the rich boon of the bishop's blessing. There were at least five
                            hundred mothers, each with a squalling infant in her arms, and some of
                            them with two. For ear-splitting shrillness and harshness I will pit the
                            squall of the Mexican olive-branch against any other sound, vocal or
                            mechanical, in the world, not excepting the creak of an ungreased axle
                            or the matin song of that domestic warbler, the guinea hen. They kicked
                            and squalled, and the overworked bishop dissolved in perspiration as he
                            hurried through his arduous task.</p>
                        <p>A couple of brief letters were written in the public room of the hotel,
                            and the colonel accompanied me in a wild hunt for the post-office. A
                            very colored individual was encountered on the street. Here, I thought,
                            is one man at least, in this fragrant pandemonium of brandy, buzzards
                            and burros, who can speak English. But I slipped up on it. Another
                            colored man likewise failed us. Then I happened to remember that scores
                            of Cuban negroes had come over from Havana with their masters in times
                            past, and, learning that there was no slavery in Mexico, had concluded
                            to remain. <pb id="VAA3891-041" n="36"/> They are black to glossiness,
                            and look as if not more than one generation stood between them and the
                            horrors of the middle passage. The colonel spoke French, German and
                            Italian fluently, but no Spanish. One and another pedestrian was tried
                            with "Parlezvous Francaise?" varied with "Vous parlez Francaise,
                            monsieur," but all to no purpose. And then we tried to patch, up a
                            sentence of such disjointed Spanish words as lingered in our memory.
                                "<hi rend="i">Donde es la"</hi>&#151;. Here we stuck fast. We
                            could think of no Spanish word bearing on the question of letters or
                            stamps. "Post res-tante" was tried, but without avail. Finally it came
                            to me&#151;"el correo." How and when I acquired it I know not. It
                            seemed like inspiration. As soon as they knew what we wanted they not
                            only manifested a willingness to direct us, but sent a brown boy to show
                            us the way. At the postof-fice we first became acquainted with the
                            delicious deliberation with which public business is transacted in this
                            delightful country. The postoffice was enjoying its <hi rend="i"
                                >siesta,</hi> and was not to be disturbed. At four o'clock they
                            would be ready to take our letters. In civilized countries you can stamp
                            a letter, and send it to the office by a boy. Not so in Mexico. The
                            government prints stamps, it is true, but they can only be affixed to a
                            letter in the presence of an official. Otherwise they are <hi rend="i"
                                >nil.</hi> This requires the personal presence of the writer every
                            time a letter is mailed, or of his agent.</p>
                        <p>Having pretty thoroughly done the interior, I straggled through one of
                            the gates to have a look <pb id="VAA3891-042" n="37"/> at the
                            extra-mural population. There is another beautiful park just outside the
                            gate through which I emerged, with cocoanut trees, full of fruit, and
                            other curiosities to the Northern eye. There was a stinking ditch,
                            covered with lily pads, and beyond lay the outer city. There are streets
                            of rude board, adobe and reed houses, populous with babies, dogs, cocks,
                            goats and vermin. It is altogether inferior in architecture and tone to
                            the inside city, but richer in smell, if possible. As I thread my way
                            through the streets in an aimless sort of manner, "gawking" about, I
                            become impressed with a Mexican trait which is remarkable&#151;the
                            almost entire absence of curiosity on the part of the lower classes.
                            Nobody gives me more than a passing glance. Before a dark hovel, in one
                            of the worst quarters of the outside city, an Indian, freighted like a
                            pack-mule, has stopped for a moment, and devoutly makes the sign of the
                            cross as I overtake him. I look inside, and see lighted candles, weeping
                            women and children, a dark, scowling masculine face which seems to
                            express a rebellious defiance of fate, and a dying woman, whom a priest
                            is shriving. "What is it?" I ask of the pack-mule in the best Spanish I
                            can muster, "<hi rend="i">El vomito!</hi>" I feel my hair bristling up,
                            and a cold chill runs down my spinal column. I don't believe him, but,
                            nevertheless, I saunter back toward the hotel, at the rate of about
                            eleven miles an hour, as Mark Twain expresses it. I had always been told
                            that yellow fever disappears, even from Vera Cruz, when the Northers
                            begin to blow <pb id="VAA3891-043" n="38"/> in the fall. Nevertheless
                            the remembrance of that dying woman haunted me, and that night, as we
                            were taking a cup of delicious Cordova coffee at the house of the
                            American consul, Dr. Trow-bridge, I asked him: "Any yellow fever in the
                            city, Doctor?" "Y-a-a-s," he replied, "a good deal of it. Generally it
                            disappears with the first Norther, but this year it has staid with
                            us&#151;a fact which none of us can account for. But it is entirely
                            confined to the lower classes." It is curious to see how these old
                            stagers, who have passed the ordeal of Yellow Jack and slipped through
                            his clutches, snap their fingers in his face. They whistle him down the
                            wind. "Not a bit of danger," says Dr. Trowbridge, "unless you get
                            scared. All the people who die of yellow fever are frightened to death."
                            "But, Doctor," I feebly suggested, "how did the people get in the habit
                            of being scared." The doctor looks thoughtfully at the ceiling a moment,
                            and then intimates that in his opinion I am "getting too durned
                            inquisitive." All of which reminds me of the French turnkey's method of
                            consoling the poor devil who is being carted to the guillotine.
                            "Courage, mon brave," he says, slapping him on the shoulder; "it is
                            nothing-as you will see." Yellow fever is nothing to these fellows who
                            have had it, and are no longer eligible; but to me it is a great deal,
                            and I begin to have an ardent longing for the atmosphere of the
                            interior.</p>

                        <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> public washing place of Vera Cruz is a curious
                            institution. Stone troughs, about three feet high, extend around two
                            sides of a large square. These troughs are divided into compartments
                            which look very much like stable mangers, and each compartment in
                            addition to the receptacle for the water is furnished with a stone slab
                            upon which the linen is rubbed. Probably a hundred brown women, some of
                            them young and handsome, and others old enough and ugly enough to have
                            stirred Macbeth's hell-broth, were busily engaged in rubbing, smoking
                            and chattering as we passed; none of them gave, us more than a passing
                            glance. Their costume was cool, by no means burdensome, and admitted of
                            a lavish exposure of bust, arm and ankle. The water is furnished by the
                            city aqueduct, and each washer pays a stipulated rent. On the whole, it
                            is a great improvement on the mode of washing as practiced in the
                            interior, to be hereafter described. Such of the linen as was hung out
                            to dry seemed to be delightfully white and clean, but the process, I
                            understand, is rough on material and buttons. Leaving the washery we
                            came across an artesian well in process of construction. Here we found a
                            young man from Evansville, by the name of Collins, whose father had
                            moved to Mexico twenty years <pb id="VAA3891-045" n="40"/> ago. Although
                            American born and educated, Mr. Collins had lived so long and so
                            exclusively among Spanish-speaking people that his English had a
                            decidedly foreign accent.</p>
                        <p>The train for Mexico leaves at midnight. Tired of sight-seeing, we
                            inflicted our company on Dr. Trowbridge, the American consul, for the
                            evening. Here we met Mr. Foster, the American minister, on his way to
                            Washington, who very kindly gave us letters to his secretary, Mr.
                            Richardson, and other parties in the city of Mexico. Having passed a
                            very pleasant evening, we took up the line of march for the depot,
                            holding our noses with one hand and our traveling-bags with the other.
                            Vera Cruz is self-assertive in daylight; at night she is overwhelming.
                            At last, the preliminary fussing and fuming, and baggage-weighing and
                            ticket-buying having been accomplished, we are snugly ensconced in a
                            compartment of the English car, and the train moves out.</p>
                        <p>The first fifty miles of the road is through a "chapparel" country, and
                            by most persons the scenery is considered dreary and tiresome. It
                            interested me, however, almost as much as the sublime mountain views
                            further on. I didn't see much of it going out, but had a good look at it
                            on the return trip. It is a thorny jungle all the way, with here and
                            there a little village. You see a tangled network of thorns, with the
                            bare trunks of mahogany-looking trees shining through the mass. There
                            seems to be at least twenty varieties of tree and shrub, all richly
                            garnished with thorns, <pb id="VAA3891-046" n="41"/> the tree-tops woven
                            into fantastic shapes. There are brilliant flowers of many colors, and
                            strange birds flitting about. One tree, without leaf, is covered with a
                            profusion of yellow flowers as large as a hollyhock. It is the richest
                            and most beautiful yellow I ever saw, and is called the <hi rend="i"
                                >flor dedias</hi>&#151;the day flower. Of the birds a thrush,
                            speckled like a guinea fowl, seems to be the most startling departure
                            from the ornithological costume of our colder clime. The most
                            astonishing feature of the chapparel country is the tremendous growth of
                            the cactus. The prickly pear, which with us is cultivated in flower
                            pots, here attains the thickness of a man's body in its trunk, is twenty
                            feet high, and its spreading branches cover an area of twelve or fifteen
                            feet. The organ cactus also grows to-the same size, and looks like an
                            immense candelabra. This organ cactus is the night blooming cereus of
                            our green-houses, but instead of growing in the slender, rope-like form
                            it does with us, here its pipes are as thick as a man's arm, and grow to
                            a height of eight or ten feet. On the table lands it is used for
                            hedging, and miles and miles of it may be seen devoted to this
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Harris has a small coffee plantation at Cor-dova, and was obliged to
                            stop there on his way home to settle up one of the numerous financial
                            complications which foreigners of means are eternally getting into with
                            the government, local or general. As none of us had ever seen the
                            fragrant bean growing, we concluded to accept his invitation and lay
                            over one day. We arrived at the <pb id="VAA3891-047" n="42"/> station
                            about five o'clock. Much to our surprise we found a street railway car
                            at the depot, ready to take us to the town, about a mile distant.
                            Arriving at the town, we routed Dr. Russell from his sweet dream of
                            peace, and were made wel-come to the luxuries of wash-bowl, towel and
                            soap. Dr. R. is the last man of the ill-fated Car-lotta
                            colony&#151;a band of fiery-hearted Southrons whose high-mettled
                            souls revolted at the thought of living under the accursed gridiron
                            flag, and, as cruel fate had denied them the privilege of expiring in
                            the ultimate ditch, they packed up the few remaining "calamities" the
                            cruel fortune of war had left them, accepted the cordial invitation of
                            Maximilian and went to Mexico. At first the accounts that came back from
                            the exiled warriors exhaled only the aroma of the rose. Never was such a
                            climate; never such a soil; never so near an approach to the primal
                            paradise. The juci-ness of the orange, the mealiness of the banana, the
                            flavor of the coffee, the saccharine richness of the cane, the balminess
                            of the atmosphere, were all set forth in glowing accounts that made
                            millions of half-frozen Yankees mad with envy. They almost wished that
                                <hi rend="i">they</hi> had been licked in the great fight, and had
                            run away from their country in a sulk, if it had taken them to such a
                            delightful climate, where a fellow had nothing to do but loll in the
                            shade, and let the mango juice run down upon his beard like Aaron's
                            precious ointment, while his coffee trees bent beneath their burden, and
                            his yams grew to the size of flour barrels. <pb id="VAA3891-048" n="43"
                            /> By and by other and less entrancing accounts leaked out. One by one
                            the colonists were fever-stricken and died. Then Maximilian was
                            butchered, and the incoming administration began to fondle the Carlotta
                            colony in a way that was like unto the manner in which a grizzly bear
                            caresses a calf. Then such of them as had escaped the fever began to
                            straggle back to the United States, working their passage in sailing
                            vessels, with sallow faces, meagre wardrobes, enlarged livers and a
                            change of heart so far as their sentiments toward the old flag were
                            concerned. There is nothing that takes the rebellion out of a fellow so
                            quickly and completely as residence among the Latinized mongrels of
                            Mexico, and the few of the Carlotta colony who still survive feel such a
                            thrill shoot through their lumbar vertebrae at the sight of the old flag
                            as we, who have never sinned and repented, are strangers to. Dr. Russell
                            is the Last Man. He is sad, silent and gentle now, all the fierceness of
                            his ardent nature having been burnt out in the refining fires of
                            adversity. He remains because his interests keep him here, and he has
                            become to a certain extent reconciled to his exile, but his heart is
                            still in the Union, and he could almost put his arms about a
                            Massachusetts Yankee's neck. The doctor runs a coffee plantation and
                            practices medicine at intervals. To the poor he is a benison, and many a
                            fever-stricken Indian owes his life to his unrequited attention. He
                            speaks Spanish with Castilian purity, and that easy, self-assured
                            deliberation which alone can hold its own with the polite <pb
                                id="VAA3891-049" n="44"/> guile of the Mexican officials; he is
                            tenacious of his rights. Only a few days before we arrived he had his
                            horse shot from under him, but I am happy to say the act had no
                            political significance. It was the protest of Mexican communists who
                            were disposed to dispute the title which the government had given the
                            doctor to his lands. By the way, the doctor desires to hear from the
                            heirs of Bernardo G. Colfield, a colonist from Indiana or IIIinois, he
                            thinks, who went to Cordova in 1865, bought lands, returned to the
                            United States and died. The lands have increased in value, and he thinks
                            something can be saved for the heirs by paying up the taxes.</p>
                        <p>Cordova is a Spanish town. They are all alike, the same low, flat-roofed,
                            yellow houses, thick walls, brick roofs and floors, grated windows and
                            open "courts," with a fountain and flowers in the better class of
                            dwellings; the same old churches, often embellished with blue porcelain
                            tiles, and the same garden spot of a plaza.</p>
                        <p>Possibly Cordova has more "get up" about it than the ordinary Mexican
                            town of its class. It has public schools of which it is justly proud,
                            and aspires to be the rural Athens of Mexico. While we were there a
                            furious discussion was raging in its newspapers among the <hi rend="i"
                                >dilletanti</hi> as to whether the name should be spelled with a "b"
                            or a "v." The preponderance of evidence seemed to be in favor of the "
                            b," though the bulk of usage takes Sam. Weller's view of it, and spells
                            it "with a wee." By the way, Mexican orthography is one <pb
                                id="VAA3891-050" n="45"/> of those things which no fellow can find
                            out. They use the "b" and the "v," the "g" and the "j," the "s" and the
                            "x," and various other letters, interchangeably, and not infrequently
                            you find a word in which three letters may be used interchangeably.
                            General is spelled with a "g" or a "j," just as the speller happens to
                            be a liberal or a conservative. Mexico is spelled with an "x" or a "j,"
                            and pronounced Meh-ico. Orizaba with a "b" or a "v," Tuxpan with an "x"
                            or an "s," and some of them confuse the "n" and "m." The "y" and the "i"
                            also get mixed.</p>
                        <p>Cordova is situated on the first plateau of the elevations which
                            gradually lead up to the table lands, nearly eight thousand feet above
                            the level of the sea. It is in the "hot lands," and everything is
                            decidedly tropical in appearance. Vegetation is rank, and the atmosphere
                            moist. The uncultivated lands are almost an impenetrable jungle, starred
                            with the brilliant red flowers of the tulipan and other floral beauties.
                            Cocoa nuts, mangoes, zapotes, guavas, oranges, lemons, and scores of
                            other tropical fruits, abound, while myriads of the most magnificent
                            orchids the world can show are found clinging to the trees. Coffee,
                            tobacco and fruits are the principal products. The Cordova orange is the
                            best in the world; the Cordova coffee is taking high rank, and the
                            tobacco is equal to the best of the Cuba product, though different in
                            flavor. Dr. Harris' plantation is most romantically situated about a
                            mile and a half from the town, on the bank of a little river which tears
                            along over its <pb id="VAA3891-051" n="46"/> rocky bed several hundred
                            feet below. The road to the plantation lies through long lanes of
                            hedgerows, with coffee plantations on either side. Native huts, built of
                            reeds and thatched with straw, without window or chimney, and with the
                            damp, dank earth for a floor, line the way. Lank dogs. erect their mangy
                            bristles as we pass, and magnificent fighting cocks, tethered by the
                            leg, make a passing comment. Little brown babies, naked as when they
                            came unbidden into this cruel world, and with a premonition of the fate
                            to which they are born in their sad faces, stop rolling in the dirt as
                            we pass, and fix their round white eyes on us in the nearest approach to
                            curiosity which we have yet seen in Mexico. We begin to see and feel the
                            misery which an inscrutable providence has permitted to be fastened on
                            this fair land. We see it in these miserable, fever-breeding,
                            vermin-haunted huts, but more than all in the sad, despairing gravity of
                            the native countenance.</p>
                        <p>But to return to our coffee. The coffee trees are planted in rows, with
                            intervening rows of bananas which grow to the height of fifteen or
                            twenty feet. The latter are planted for the purpose of shading the
                            coffee trees, which love moisture and heat, but quail beneath the direct
                            rays of the vertical sun. The bananas are a mere side issue, but not
                            infrequently a planter will make his year's expenses off the fruit crop,
                            and have the coffee for clear profit. I am told that there is no more
                            beautiful sight than a coffee field in full bloom. The flowers are very
                            much like orange blossoms, and exhale a delightful <pb id="VAA3891-052"
                                n="47"/> fragrance which loads the air for miles around. Now the
                            trees are in full fruit and bending beneath, the load of berries, which
                            are dark purple in color, and look very much like the cranberry. The
                            pulp which surrounds the berry has a pleasant, slightly pungent,
                            sweetish taste, and the pickers, who become addicted to nibbling as they
                            pick suffer from sleeplessness. The coffee trees on the plantations are
                            all the way from four to twelve feet high, though in some of the gardens
                            about Cordova they have grown to be as large as the medium-sized maples
                            which shade the streets of Indianapolis. Planters are sorely bedeviled
                            with the mischievous work of a sort of mole or underground rat, which
                            cuts off the trunk of the tree with its sharp teeth, and lets it fall.
                            These pests seem to have no particular object in view. They find the
                            tree in their way and cut it down. In some instances, Dr. Russell says,
                            they will cut down trees eight inches in diameter. The planter, going
                            through his grounds, gleefully rubbing his hands and estimating the
                            number of quintals he will have, finds here and there a tree with its
                            rich burden of fruit toppled over, and if an impatient oath escapes
                            between his set teeth, probably the recording angel will take the
                            provocation into account. Two of these rat-felled trees we trimmed for
                            walking sticks, and it is cited as a remarkable fact that we carried
                            them clear to the city of Mexico and back to Indianapolis. When the
                            berries are picked they are spread on the ground and the pulp allowed to
                            rot, being frequently stirred. If rain comes, <pb id="VAA3891-053"
                                n="48"/> they must take it, for the berry will not cure under
                            shelter. After a walk over the plantation we sat down to rest and eat
                            fruits at the cottage, where a slender brown fellow was pounding coffee
                            in a wooden mortar, to liberate the membrane which envelops the grains,
                            and a bright-eyed, rather pretty and demure Indian girl was sifting and
                            assorting the grains. The usual dog came and sniffed at the calves of
                            our legs; two bright little girls, mahogany in color, came and brought
                            tortillas and fried eggs as a present to Miss Harris, whom they had
                            become acquainted with on a former visit, and one of the doctor's
                            familiars brought us oranges, sweet lemons, bananas, and a small palm
                            nut, about the size of a walnut, very hard to crack, and of very little
                            account after it was cracked. Here Dr. Harris and Dr. Russell talked
                            coffee, while P. and myself ate oranges, and .the colonel admired the
                            demure little maid or matron who was sifting coffee. The colonel
                            declared he had never seen a finer pair of eyes in his life, and
                            wondered how old she was. Dr. Russell translated the question to her,
                            and she replied, with a laugh: <hi rend="i">"luien
                            sabe?"</hi>&#151;"who knows." (It is a fact, the doctor told me,
                            that many of them don't know their ages). The demure little woman was
                            conscious of the admiration she had inspired, and liked it. Not so with
                            the man at the pestle&#151;husband or lover as the case might be. He
                            brought his pestle down with a vim which made it whistle viciously, and
                            a pained look <pb id="VAA3891-054" n="49"/> came over his brown face as
                            he noted the girl's coquetry and the Colonel's pretense of
                            gallantry.</p>
                        <p>It is a lesson one soon learns in this strange country not to admire the
                            native women, too pronouncedly in the presence of the men, unless you
                            are prepared to have a knife scoured in your ribs, or your head split
                            open with a <hi rend="i">machete.</hi> The women do not object, but
                            their lovers have little toleration for flirtations in which they do not
                            play the principal <hi rend="i">role.</hi> But to return once more to
                            our coffee. The crop this year is immense, and can not be all harvested.
                            As the berries do not all ripen at once, the pickers must go through
                            several times. In the last picking they strip the trees of the green
                            berries so as to give them a chance to rest awhile before beginning the
                            next crop. The planters suffer greatly from thieves, but still make
                            large profits. The culture is increasing each year, and new plantations
                            are being continually opened. The foreign demand for Cordova coffee is
                            constantly increasing, and already the dealers of New Orleans are
                            palming off other brands as the genuine Cordova article. On the tips of
                            each twig grow a handful of small, round berries, which are called <hi
                                rend="i">caricarilla.</hi> This berry is so highly prized by
                            Mexicans that none of it is ever exported. While the ordinary Cordova
                            berries sell at seventeen cents a pound, <hi rend="i">caricarilla</hi>
                            commands forty cents for home consumption. Miss Harris gave us a small
                            bag of these fancy berries, which we brought home with us. I have been
                            experimenting with <hi rend="i">caricarilla,</hi> and must confess that
                            I can not find anything remarkable in it. It is <pb id="VAA3891-055"
                                n="50"/> very strong and heavy-flavored, and makes a clear and very
                            black coffee, but seems to lack the delicate aroma of some other brands.
                            I am half inclined to accept Dr. Russell's theory. Though a
                            coffee-grower himself, he contends that all this pretense of nice
                            discrimination in coffee is sheer humbug. He says he has tested experts
                            with alternate cups of coffee made by the same artist, one of the <hi
                                rend="i">caricarilla</hi> and the other of the blasted, cracked and
                            refuse grains, and they couldn't tell one from the other. Perhaps it's
                            like it is with whisky. When a fellow is nearly dead for a drink a swig
                            of r. g. makes him smack his lips and gabble about nectar, while under
                            other circumstances he will denounce the finest eighteen-year-old
                            Bourbon as r. g. When he gets one or two drinks into him, his palate
                            lies like a politician.</p>
                        <p>A curious tribe of Indians are seen in the streets of Cordova. The men
                            wear the ordinary ponche and a pair of white cotton trousers, coming
                            down halfway to the knee, while the Women are plainly attired in white
                            shirt and a strip of blue cloth tied about the waist and falling to the
                            ankles. They pay tribute to the Mexican government but will not serve in
                            the army. The women will not speak to or look at anybody not belonging
                            to their tribe, and the men boast that they were never conquered by the
                            Spaniards. Miss Harris called my attention to something hanging out of a
                            shop window, which looked like two or three bundles of fodder arranged
                            to shed the rain. It proved to be a Mexican <pb id="VAA3891-056" n="51"
                            /> overcoat, made of grass and worn by these people in the rainy
                            season.</p>
                        <p>While sitting in Dr. Russell's parlor in the evening, said parlor being
                            ornamented with a pair of navy sixes and a Winchester rifle, we were
                            startled by a terrible scurrying and scampering in the garret overhead.
                            On inquiring of the doctor we were told that it was only his opossums at
                            play. These creatures are harbored on account of their rat-hunting
                            propensities. We had put in a busy day at Cordova. After dinner at the
                            house of a German woman who had listened to Dr. Russell's intercession
                            and kindly consented to feed us, three of us retired to rest at Don
                            Juan's hostelry, while Dr. Harris and his daughter were accommodated
                            with a bed at Dr. Russell's. As we had to get up at four, a good deal of
                            solicitude was expressed as to the reliability of Holy Cross, the porter
                            of Don Juan's inn, whose duty it was to wake us. The Don, who is a
                            smoothly-shaven, dulcet-voiced Castilian, and looks as if he ought to
                            have been a priest, shrugged his shoulders when questioned as to Holy
                            Cross's liability to oversleep himself, and replied that he (H. C.) was
                            a mule. Dr. Russell gave it as his opinion that if Holy Cross should
                            have an attack of nightmare about half-past three, and should wake up
                            just as the wild bull was overtaking him, he would not go to sleep again
                            until four, and we would be aroused in time. The consequence was that we
                            all went to bed with it on our minds, and began getting up in sections,
                            all the way from midnight to four o'clock. Don Juan's <pb
                                id="VAA3891-057" n="52"/> rooms are not as magnificently furnished
                            as those of the New York hotels. Our room had a brick floor, grated
                            windows, doors like a jail, and a key that would weigh about seven
                            pounds. The beds were mere cots, without mattrass, but covered with the
                            snowiest linen sheets and the gay blanket of the country.
                            Notwithstanding the novelty of the situation, we slept soundly until we
                            began getting up.</p>

                        <p>I H<hi rend="sc">AVE</hi> frittered away my descriptive powers on
                            inferior subjects, and therefore can not do justice to the beauty and
                            grandeur of the mountain scenery of Mexico. After leaving the "low flat
                            land" of the coast, and beginning the ascent to the table lands, the
                            route affords a constant succession of surprises. First come the
                            Chiquihuites, groups of round, smooth domes, covering the mountain tops,
                            and looking like inverted peach baskets. In the mellow distance, the
                            verdant pines that cover the surface of these baby mountains are
                            indistinguishable as individual trees, and the surfaces look smooth as
                            if the grass had been closely cut with a lawn mower. There are fleeting
                            glimpses of waterfalls, where a silver stream bursts through a dark
                            gorge in the mountain's side, tumbles in a white sheet over a precipice,
                            and then foams its way to the Gulf. Over immense iron bridges,
                            apparently <pb id="VAA3891-058" n="53"/> sixty, seventy or a hundred
                            feet high; creeping around the edges of chasms where a broken rail would
                            give a sheer fall of a thousand feet; plunging through tunnel after
                            tunnel, the train goes, drawn by an immense double-headed
                            engine&#151;up, up, until the rarified air makes breathing
                            difficult, and the blood gushes from the noses of some of the
                            passengers. Within a distance of thirty miles the train makes an ascent
                            of four thousand feet. For two hours, at least, we circle around the
                            little Indian village of Maltrate, on different levels, until Alta Luz
                            (high light) is reached. It seems as if we cannot get away from
                            Maltrate. First we stop there, and are besieged by scores of spruce and
                            rather handsome Indian women with tortillas, delicious pine apples,
                            chirimoyas and other fruits to sell. The chirimoya is the crack fruit of
                            Mexico. It is large, greenish-looking, irregular in shape, some of the
                            biggest weighing a pound, and full of a custard-like pulp, the sweet
                            richness of which is tempered with a delicious sub-acid. The village of
                            Maltrate is pure Indian. No white man need apply. It is a neat,
                            trim-looking place, and is full of caste. They have an aristocracy, a
                            middle class and a poor class, and are great sticklers for keeping up
                            the barriers between them. Leaving this village the train climbs around
                            and around, almost doubling on itself, and from higher elevations the
                            village again bursts upon our sight, until finally from Alta Luz it is
                            seen far, far below, its streets and houses and neatly-trimmed gardens
                            looking like a toy village. Men and beasts appear as insects. In <pb
                                id="VAA3891-059" n="54"/> making the ascent we get glimpses of
                            delightful valleys, which seem in their sylvan beauty and the freshness
                            of their verdure to realize our dreams of Paradise. Up one of these fair
                            vales, just beyond a clump of what seem to be fruit trees, but
                            unfortunately out of sight, lies another Indian village, more remarkable
                            even than Maltrate. Its people are more exclusive than the Japanese used
                            to be. They will not even give a white man food or shelter for fear he
                            may be seeking a lodgment in their town.</p>
                        <p>Fantastic names are given to many of the points of interest in this
                            mountain region, such as "EI Infernillo" (the Little Hell), Devil's
                            Balcony, etc. In some places, we are told, the workmen, tied in chairs,
                            were swung from the precipices, and thus suspended over a chasm hundreds
                            of feet deep, hewed the roadway out of the solid rock. The little
                            shanties of the road watchmen, with maybe a bit of garden around them,
                            are the only signs of civilization seen as we rise above the valleys.
                            All is wild, weird and grand&#151;oppressively grand.</p>
                        <p>At Boca del Monte (throat of the mountain) the highest elevation is
                            reached, and we enter upon the table land, 7,500 feet above the sea. It
                            is a small station, with a few eating and drinking houses. The woods are
                            full of a very peculiar orchid, which has a vermilion-colored cone about
                            eight inches long, an inch and a half thick, and covered with
                            over-lapping scales like those of a pineapple. The Mexican trees are
                            full of parasites. Besides the orchids mentioned, there are <pb
                                id="VAA3891-060" n="55"/> thousands of little tufts of a
                            moss-looking substance fastened to the limbs.</p>
                        <p>From Boca del Monte to the city an entirely new variety of scenery is
                            presented. It is a flat, treeless stretch of arid-looking land, in many
                            respects like our western plains, but hedged in with blue mountains.
                            Immense fields devoted to the cultivation of maize and barley are seen
                            on either side, with the white farm-houses, walled like forts and
                            surrounded by the adobe huts of the peons, in the distance. Scarcely a
                            tree or a shrub is to be seen. It is one eternal, monotonous expanse of
                            brown earth, with scarcely a morsel of green to relieve the tired eye.
                            The low, stunted stalks of last season's corn crop, planted a single
                            grain in the hill, and the barley stubble, indicate that the land is
                            productive; otherwise we would set it down as a desert. There are no
                            fences. Ditches seem to mark the measure of the land. Some of the
                            haciendas are of immense extent, embracing land enough for an entire
                            county. Doubtless in the rainy season there is a change for the better
                            in the appearance of the country, but in January it looks gloomy enough.
                            As we trundle along at the leisurely Mexican rate of travel, which,
                            moderate as it is, is fast enough to raise clouds of dust, we see from
                            the car window herds of circling horses tramping out the grain which the
                            peons are winnowing; herds of cattle, black sheep and lop-eared swine;
                            while every few moments a whirlwind carries a spiral column of dust far
                            upward toward the sky. The atmosphere is delightfully clear, and the <pb
                                id="VAA3891-061" n="56"/> blue mountains, which are leagues upon
                            leagues away, seem almost at our feet. Now we see great Orizaba's
                            glistening peak, so close that through a field glass we can mark the
                            wide chasm through which he once poured his flood of hissing lava, and
                            now some pigmy peak obscures the view. Malin-che (named after the Indian
                            mistress of Cortez) is an unassuming mountain, whose moderate height
                            does not admit of eternal snow.</p>
                        <p>Very frequently she wears a white head-dress for her morning reception,
                            but the hot sun soon burns it away. Then comes a happy point where, if
                            the atmosphere is favorable, all three of the great snow mountains,
                            Orizaba, Popocatapetl and Ixtaccihuatl, are visible. The man who is
                            fortunate enough to get this magnificent view, for even one fleeting
                            moment, will have something to remember as long as he lives. There is
                            something in the cold, pure majesty of the snow mountains which
                            fascinates and overawes. The more you see of them the less familiar they
                            become. They are no longer inanimate things. They seem to sit in calm
                            judgment on the sin-cursed land.</p>
                        <p>Mexico is probably as quiet now as it ever has been or ever will be. But
                            we see many things that testify to the uncertain tenure of life and
                            property. An escort of soldiers accompanies each train. The white arms
                            of crosses, erected at intervals along the roadside, mark the spots
                            where the bones of murdered men are crumbling to dust, and at each
                            station a squad of cavalry, mounted on richly caparisoned horses, with
                            carbines in <pb id="VAA3891-062" n="57"/> holsters and sabres at their
                            sides, are drawn up along the platform. These are detachments of the
                            Interior Guard, an organization gotten up by Diaz to protect his own and
                            the people's interests against robbers and revolutionists. This guard is
                            made up of a much better class of men than the regular army. The finest
                            squad I saw was at Huamantla, a town which has the proud distinction of
                            having more churches and robbers than any other place in Mexico. They
                            were fine-looking, intelligent, determined fellows, and the most
                            magnificent horsemen in the world. They ride erect in the saddle, with
                            their legs straight in the stirrups, and horse and rider move so
                            harmoniously that they seem to be blended in a single animal.</p>
                        <p>By and by we get out of the barley country and strike the pulque region.
                            Here a new wonder opens to the view. For hours and hours the train
                            passes through interminable fields of the American aloe, or maguey, as
                            it is called. It is what is known in American green-houses as the
                            century plant. From it is procured the national tipple of
                            Mexico&#151;pulque. The vastness of these pulque fields is almost
                            incredible. On either side, behind, ahead, as far as the tired eye can
                            reach, you see nothing but endless rows of maguey plants, in various
                            stages of growth, some of them shooting their tall bloom spires twelve
                            or fifteen feet in the air, but most of them getting ready to yield
                            their sap for the favorite drink. It takes eight years for the maguey to
                            come to perfection. At this age the tap root is cut, the center of the
                            great plant scooped <pb id="VAA3891-063" n="58"/> out, leaving a hollow
                            cup that will hold two or three gallons of sap, and the work of pulque
                            making begins. For eight or nine months the sap flows, and a healthy,
                            well-grown plant will yield four or five hundred gallons of fluid, after
                            which it is done for. The unfermented juice is called <hi rend="i">agua
                                miel</hi> (honey water), and is well entitled to the name. It is
                            very rich in saccharine matter, and very delicate. When slightly
                            fermented it is a pleasant, refreshing drink, with the merest trace of
                            alcohol, but when "at its best," as the Mexicans like it, after having
                            been wallowed about in the filthy pig-skins in which it is transported,
                            it becomes the most atrocious beverage that ever a man put into his
                            stomach. In this condition of "ripeness" it is milky white in color,
                            thick and ropy, a powerful intoxicant, and tastes like rotten buttermilk
                            braced up with pine-top whisky. It is more infamous than hard cider or
                            "black-strap." I had heard much of pulque, and with that curiosity which
                            naturally precedes the acquisition of knowledge, embraced the first
                            opportunity for making its acquaintance. I bought some from an Indian
                            girl, paying a <hi rend="i">claco</hi> (about a cent and a half) for a
                            quart of it, vessel and all, and tasted. It was fresh from the plant,
                            with just enough of fermentation to produce a creamy foam on the
                            surface, and had never touched a pig-skin. I found it nice but formed a
                            rather contemptuous opinion of its drunk-making powers.</p>
                        <p>The next I tasted was in the city of Mexico, where the gaily-painted sign
                            of a dancing girl, <pb id="VAA3891-064" n="59"/> with an inscription
                            announcing "<hi rend="i">pulques finosy ac-creditos</hi>" invited the
                            weary wayfarer to pause and "refresco" himself. In response to my demand
                            the vender seized a large glass that would hold about a pint, and with a
                            leprous thumb on the outside and a leprous finger on the inside dipped
                            it into the barrel, and drew it forth full of "accredited" pulque. The
                            finger in the glass made me feel a little qualmish, and I motioned
                            toward a vessel with a handle. With a muttered imprecation, and a growl
                            which seemed like a Spanish translation of a celebrated apothegm, to the
                            effect that "some folks are a l-e-e-tle too nice to live," he filled up
                            the other glass without giving his fingers a bath. Ugh! I can taste it
                            yet. I can fancy nothing like it unless it be the fermented <hi rend="i"
                                >must</hi> of grapes mixed with rancid buttermilk, and flavored with
                            "all sorts" from a villainous rum-mill. The maguey is propagated from
                            shoots or suckers. These shoots are taken up, the roots cut off, and
                            then the plants are left lying in the sun for a month or two, until
                            thoroughly dried, when they are planted. Unless taken through this
                            preparatory course the absurd things would rot on being put into the
                            ground. What most astonishes the traveler is the overwhelming extent of
                            pulque culture. Here are millions of acres of land devoted to the
                            culture of a luxury&#151;something that goes down the throat and
                            produces neither bone, blood nor muscle. It is the thief that steals
                            away the miserable brains of these two-legged beasts of burden. The
                            "invisible spirit" of pulque leaves visible traces all over this part of
                                <pb id="VAA3891-065" n="60"/> the republic. The "pulque train"
                            leaves the city of Mexico every morning, and returns at night, laden
                            with the precious juice.</p>
                        <p>It is distributed all over the city and in the surrounding towns in pig
                            and sheepskins. A load of these pulque-filled skins reminds me of
                            nothing so much as a lot of cholera hogs in a dead animal wagon on the
                            way to their destination. They lie on their backs in the cart, their
                            feet sticking up, and, the liquor having softened the skin, they shake
                            and quiver in the most disgusting manner. The gayest shops in the city
                            are pulque shops. The stuff is so disgustingly cheap, and when in prime
                            condition so full of drunk, that it is astonishing how little of real
                            drunkenness is seen. When cleanly and carefully handled, however, pulque
                            is capable of being made into a very appetizing drink. It is so delicate
                            that the slightest contact with a pig-skin ruins it, but when fermented
                            in earthen jars it becomes a very pleasant and comparatively harmless
                            beverage. At Dr. Harris' I tasted some which had all the sparkle and
                            freshness of champagne. The doctor says it cured him of a bad case of
                            dyspepsia, and that when cleanly prepared it is a sovereign remedy for
                            many forms of that disease. The pulque plant is capable of being useful
                            as well as ornamental. Ropes, paper and linen may be made of its fibres.
                            In the museum of the city of Mexico may be seen specimens of the picture
                            writing of the Aztecs, upon paper made from this plant. Perhaps the time
                            may come when so poor a people as the majority <pb id="VAA3891-066"
                                n="61"/> of Mexicans are can find something better for the maguey to
                            do than to make them drunk.</p>
                        <p>The pyramids of San Juan Teotihuacan are about the last visible point of
                            interest before entering the city of Mexico. Soon after leaving this
                            point night overtakes the train, and with the exception of occasional
                            glimpses of lake Texcuco nothing is to be seen until we fetch up in the
                            depot at Buena Vista, and once more have the delightful felicity of
                            running the custom-house gauntlet. It is one of the peculiarities of the
                            Mexican mode of doing business that the traveler, having passed through
                            one custom-house at Vera Cruz, encounters another at the end of his
                            journey&#151;which looks like rubbing it in on a fellow. The
                            pyramids&#151;supposed to represent the sun and moon&#151;are
                            great mounds of earth, full of bones and precious relics. Wagon-loads of
                            grotesque heads of men and animals, moulded in clay and cut in stone,
                            are picked up in the neighborhood, and one little, two little, twenty
                            little "in-jun boys" offer them for sale. I bought about half a gallon
                            of these images, with some spear and arrow-heads of obsidian (the black
                            glass-like substance of which the blades of Lew. Wallace's ma-quahuitls
                            were made) for a <hi rend="i">real</hi>&#151;twelve and a half
                            cents. They were mostly of clay, but among them were a head of cut stone
                            and two or three stone buttons or beads, which the young savage had tied
                            together by a string, and which he held up for my admiration as
                            something especially precious. As I afterward saw some of the same kind
                            in the museum, I conclude that they are more ancient than the clay <pb
                                id="VAA3891-067" n="62"/> images. It isn't always safe to purchase
                            relics, but these images are so abundant about San Juan that it is
                            infinitely cheaper to pick up the genuine than it would be to make
                            counterfeits.</p>

                        <p>A <hi rend="sc">COLORED</hi> coachman conveyed us from the depot to the
                            Hotel Comonfort, in the street of Cinco de Mayo, (the 5th of May.) This
                            is a favorite name for pulque shops and other things in the city of
                            Mexico. On inquiry we learn that the 5th of May has almost as much
                            importance in Mexico as the Fourth of July with us. On that day they
                            defeated (or thought they did) the French at Puebla. Our colored
                            coachman proves to be a Georgia negro who came out with Scott's army as
                            servant to one of the officers. On the withdrawal of the army he
                            concluded to remain. He liked the climate. Better still, he liked the
                            idea of being his own master. He has accumulated lucre, and on the whole
                            is pretty well contented with the situation. Before the emancipation his
                            heart was nearly broken with the longing to revisit the scenes of his
                            childhood. Now that he could safely make the visit without danger of
                            having the shackles refas-tened on his limbs, he cares less about it,
                            though he still vaguely intends to carry out the project at some future
                            time. He has become thoroughly infected <pb id="VAA3891-068" n="63"/>
                            with the indolent <hi rend="i">manana</hi> spirit of Mexico, which makes
                            a point of never doing to-day that which can be put off till to-morrow.
                            The Hotel Comonfort we found to be a rather modern building, for Mexico,
                            built with open interior court and inside galleries for each floor. It
                            looked a little queer to see the stars above us in place of a roof. We
                            got good rooms at the rate of forty dollars per month, neatly carpeted
                            and furnished with brass bedsteads and soft mattresses. We had scarcely
                            got settled in our new quarters before Pedro Dal-cour, our young Mexican
                            friend, came to call on us, and took us out for a walk.</p>
                        <p>The cocktail and helmet hat have both invaded Mexico. After taking a cup
                            of delicious chocolate such as can be found nowhere else than in
                            Mexico&#151;we dropped in at a <hi rend="i">cantina</hi> to sample
                            the beverages of the country. While sipping a mild dilution of cognac, I
                            heard the familiar screech of a drunken man in the street, and a moment
                            after a young Mexican, in a helmet hat, burst into the room, and began a
                            series of the most affectionate demonstrations. He was frightfully
                            drunk&#151;drunk enough for the United States. He embraced the
                            colonel, and fell upon P.'s neck. Then he threw a hard dollar on the
                            table, and insisted on a drink all around with his <hi rend="i">amigos
                                Americanos.</hi> He loved the <hi rend="i">gringos</hi> because they
                            had some style about them. We got away as quickly as we could. "What has
                            that man been drinking ?" I asked of Pedro, who speaks a little English.
                            "Cocktails!" he replied. The cocktail came in with the helmet <pb
                                id="VAA3891-069" n="64"/> hat some weeks previous, and this
                            progressive Mexican took to them both. Pedro predicted that he would
                            sleep in the <hi rend="i">deputacion,</hi> a prediction which, as we
                            learned afterward, was verified. I may as well state, however, that this
                            was the only howling drunk we saw in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>I got but little sleep the first night in the Hotel Comonfort. There was
                            a niggardly allowance of bed clothing, and my first experience of the
                            boasted climate of Mexico was anything but reassuring. It was an eager
                            and a nipping air, and the great ulster which I had taken along with
                            many misgivings, proved my salvation. There was a bell in the church of
                            the <hi rend="i">Profesa,</hi> just across the way, which began ringing
                            about four o'clock and kept up a succession of sharp, quick strokes,
                            with a few minutes' intermission between each attack, until six. And
                            throughout the night the policemen broke out every hour with a
                            long-drawn, shrill whistle. The Mexican policeman is the sleepiest of
                            his kind. During my stay I rarely saw one at night that was not asleep.
                            He wraps his blanket around him, sits him in a doorway, and laps his
                            gentle soul in the elysium of dreams, during which his number comes from
                            the lottery wheel, and for a few brief hours he is a nabob. I suppose
                            they must take turns at the whistle, as it is as regular as
                            clockwork.</p>
                        <p>I got up early in the morning, and went out alone to hunt a baiber-shop
                            and bath-room. I found the barber first, a grave and grizzled man, with
                            an evident admixture of the Indian in his <pb id="VAA3891-070" n="65"/>
                            blood. He sat me down in a low chair without any back, in front of a
                            mirror; there was a little table, in the drawer of which he kept his
                            implements, the lower part of the mirror being hidden by folds of glazed
                            muslin. I had to stick my legs under the table, and "scrooch" a little
                            every time he went to the drawer for the implements of his diabolical
                            trade. I came very near falling into his trap. His little game was to
                            harrass me into stretching my legs through his two-dollar looking-glass,
                            and then charge me sixteen dollars for the damage. He lathered well, and
                            I began to believe that for once my prescient soul was apprehensive
                            without cause. He seized my nose and began to rasp. The Mexican razor is
                            uniformly dull, but he made up in strength what it lacked in edge. He
                            shaved with a broad, free stroke, cutting upward where a United States
                            barber cuts down, and doing everything in a way of his own. I set my
                            teeth hard and breathed a silent prayer. Now I thought an ear would
                            surely go. That peril passed, I would have paid a high premium to
                            in-sure my nose. He finally got through, and beyond the fright I was
                            none the worse. Then he held a soup dish filled with lemon juice under
                            my chin, sponged my face, threw a towel over it, and signified that I
                            might finish the job myself.</p>
                        <p>At the bath-house they brought me a little cake of soap, which looked
                            like a cracker, two tiny bottles of sweet-smelling oleaginous stuff, and
                            a wisp of sea-grass like a bird's nest. "<hi rend="i">Camisa
                                caliente?</hi>" inquired the attendant. "<hi rend="i">Si,</hi>" I
                            replied. You must <pb id="VAA3891-071" n="66"/> always say "Si" in
                            Mexico whether you "see it" or not, as it impresses the attendant with
                            the idea that you know what you are about, and will not be easily
                            swindled. I got into the soft hot water and gave myself up to the luxury
                            of the bath, all the time wondering what a <hi rend="i">camisa
                                caliente</hi> was, and feeling a sense of injury because he had not
                            brought it. Coming out of the bath, a new wonder presented
                            itself&#151;that bird's nest. Of the two vials of oil I assumed one
                            was for the hair and the other for the skin, but the bird's nest puzzled
                            me. Finally I guessed it. It was to be used as a flesh brush, and right
                            well did it answer the purpose. I had about got through with my rubbing
                            and scrubbing, when the attendant came and brought me a night-shirt
                            which had been warmed at the fire. This, then, was the <hi rend="i"
                                >camisa caliente,</hi> but its use puzzled me. With a feeling of awe
                            I hurriedly dressed and sneaked out, leaving the pesky thing neatly
                            folded up. To this day I am ignorant as to what I ought to have done
                            with it. "<hi rend="i">Cuanto,</hi>" I asked of the attendant. He told
                            me just how much, but I wasn't yet up in the matter of <hi rend="i"
                                >reals</hi> and <hi rend="i">medios.</hi> In despair I gave him
                            three quarters. For a brief moment he hesitated between the temptation
                            to demand more and the impulse to be content with what I had given. Then
                            he thought of his sainted mother, and with a sigh gave me back one
                            quarter and a six-and-a-fourth cent piece.</p>
                        <p>Mexico is not a walled city, though most people have that impression. It
                            is surrounded by ditches and canals. The private walls which are found
                                <pb id="VAA3891-072" n="67"/> everywhere, and the great aqueduct
                            built by the Spaniards a hundred and thirty-eight years ago, often
                            confirm visitors in the erroneous opinion that it is walled. It has a
                            population of about two hundred thousand, less by a hundred thousand
                            than at the time of the conquest. Its architecture is massive and
                            monotonous. The site is in a level plain, once the bed of the lake,
                            surrounded by mountains. Its sky for the greater part of the year is of
                            the purest sapphire&#151;the clearest, brightest, most brilliant
                            blue, with not a cloud speck to be seen, though a haze generally hangs
                            about the mountain tops, hiding the peaks and bases of Popocatapetl and
                            Ixtaccihuatl. Now and then this haze is swept off, and for an entire day
                            the two snow mountains, which are distant a full day's journey, seem no
                            more than five miles away, while the nearer ranges are almost within
                            rifle shot. On these rare occasions the view from the cathedral tower is
                            worth a journey round the world to see. With the exception of the fires
                            of the charcoal burners which dot the mountain sides, there is nothing
                            to cloud the air. Mexico burns little fuel. The patient mule furnishes
                            the motive power for her few manufactories, and there are not a hundred
                            stoves or grates in the entire city. A very little charcoal in an open
                            brazier is made to do a great deal of cooking, and no fuel save that
                            which may be acquired at the drinking houses is needed for heating. The
                            city is badly drained. Originally a lake, with canals for streets, and
                            an occasional solid causeway, its site is now a morass, <pb
                                id="VAA3891-073" n="68"/> with the water but a few feet below the
                            surface. Its boasted climate is peculiar&#151;you freeze on one side
                            of the street and roast on the other.</p>
                        <p>The rarified air affects some people very disagreeably. After a week's
                            residence you feel as if you had been baked in a lime-kiln until every
                            particle of moisture had been expelled. Eyes, nose, mouth, lips and
                            throat are parched. Some visitors are unable to sleep. Climbing a single
                            flight of stairs takes away your breath, and you have to sit down at the
                            top and gasp. As for health, the death-rate is higher than that of Vera
                            Cruz. Typhoid fevers are almost epidemic the year round, and pneumonia
                            runs a rapid and generally fatal course. The old residents seem
                            peculiarly susceptible to colds, and spend most of their leisure time in
                            putting on and off their overcoats, and getting out of the way of
                            drafts. Their existence is a nightmare, and yet they will overwhelm you
                            with eulogies of their "delightful climate." The surroundings are lovely
                            in spots. There are beautiful roadways, lined with trees, and statuary
                            and stone benches at intervals. Where the land is irrigated it is
                            marvelously green and fresh, but in other places it looks dry and
                            parched, and in spots the receding lake has left saline and alkaline
                            wastes where no sprig of vegetation grows. The ditches are covered with
                            a green and purple confervoid growth. Everywhere the eucalyptus tree,
                            imported by Maximilian, shoots its graceful spire toward the sky. In
                            former times the city was subject to overflow. A lion's head at <pb
                                id="VAA3891-074" n="69"/> the corner of St. Francis and Holy Ghost
                            streets marks the height of the last serious inundation, about fifty
                            years ago. The head is seven or eight feet from the ground. At this time
                            there was serious talk of removing the city to the high ground about
                            Tacubaya and Chapultepec, but a lucky earthquake let out the water, and
                            since then the lake has almost entirely disappeared. It is a curious
                            city, inhabited by a curious people. They shoot their emperors, hang
                            their pictures on the palace walls, and educate their children. They
                            divide their loving admiration between Iturbide's portrait and the
                            quaint old flint-lock muskets with which they did him to death. The
                            government is a republic modified by despotism. It is a nation of
                            incongruities. Caste is cruel, and democracy ostentatious. Politeness
                            that means nothing is oppressive. The millionaire who lights his
                            cigarette from a naked Indian's <hi rend="i">puro</hi> utters his "<hi
                                rend="i">mil gra-cias, Senor,</hi>" with an air of sincerity that
                            carries conviction, and bows with a courtly grace that is enchanting. He
                            will tell you that his house, his horse, his purse, his everything, is
                            yours; but it is merely a pleasant fiction which has become sanctified
                            by antiquity. He would be inexpressibly shocked and grieved if you were
                            to take him at his word.</p>
                        <p>Mexican law is one of those things that no fellow&#151;not even a
                            clairvoyant&#151;can find out. When the authorities want to do
                            anything, they can always rake up a law to suit the case from their
                            legal junk shop, or if they can't find one entire, they will <pb
                                id="VAA3891-075" n="70"/> take broken pieces and patch up one to
                            suit. They have an assorted lot of laws laid away for emergencies; and
                            yet they have some crude ideas of justice which might be serviceably
                            adopted by more civilized communities. A dead-beat may be jugged in
                            Mexico, while with us he is cock of the walk. If you are beaten out of
                            money or property by a swindler, you can put him in jail and keep him
                            there. In fact, you've <hi rend="i">got</hi> to keep him there, because
                            if he gets out the very first thing he does will be to slap <hi rend="i"
                                >you</hi> in. The only safe way to let a fellow out of jail is to
                            make him give bond, with approved security, that he will not retaliate.
                            Mexico is the only city in the world that has subdued its hack-drivers.
                            Some of them have countenances that would insure a verdict of guilty on
                            most any charge, but you never hear of their robbing passengers, or
                            attempting to over-charge them. Fifty cents an hour is the established
                            rate, and I never heard of one demanding more. A trifle, <hi rend="i"
                                >pour boire,</hi> is usually thrown in as a gratuity. Neither are
                            they noisy and insolent as in other cities. They never yell at each
                            other in passing. Their reticence and general good behavior inspired me
                            with awe. But Mexican laws are stringent, and are mercilessly enforced
                            against the lower classes. The silence of the population seems
                            phenomenal to an American. In the market places there is no loud talk.
                            Even the donkey-drivers admonish their puny beasts with a whispered
                            "tchee!"</p>
                        <p>The deportment of the Indian population is <pb id="VAA3891-076" n="71"/>
                            quiet and accords with the sad gravity of their faces. Indeed, the more
                            I see of this people, the less credence I give to tales that are told of
                            their indolence and treacherous cruelty. So far from being lazy they are
                            the hardest workers I ever saw. A Mexican Indian's spine must be a
                            curious piece of mechanism. You see hundreds and hundreds of them coming
                            in every morning from the surrounding villages, loaded like pack-mules,
                            with fruit, vegetables and other articles. They travel at a swinging dog
                            trot, and will come a distance of ten or twelve miles, carrying burdens
                            that do not weigh less than three or four hundred pounds. And they are
                            not large men, either. Stone, lumber, charcoal, and other bulky
                            materials are carried on the backs of men and donkeys. There are few
                            carts. Licensed carriers, wearing leathern helmets and a leather armor
                            with their number on it, are seen everywhere. Four of them will pick up
                            a great piano and trot entirely across the city with it in less time
                            than you could hitch up a dray and haul it. The water from the aqueduct
                            is deposited in fountains in different parts of the city, and these
                            carriers distribute it among the houses. Their honesty is such that they
                            are allowed to enter houses without watching. At each trip the carrier
                            leaves a little red bean, and by these, settlement is made at the end of
                            the week. Everything is done by hand, and labor-saving machinery is
                            regarded as a robbery of the poor. The streets are cleanly swept every
                            night by squads of men armed with little bundles of twigs. The <pb
                                id="VAA3891-077" n="72"/> scrupulous cleanliness of the streets and
                            parks, and the absence of coal dust in the air, is more than
                            counteracted by the horrible filth of the ditches in the suburbs.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                        <p>O<hi rend="sc">UR</hi> first day in Mexico was spent in aimless
                            floundering, trying vainly to get started. First there were the
                            colonel's shoes to be attended to. Being a large, heavy man, the effect
                            of walking over cobble stones in a pair of short shoes may be imagined.
                            He had been recommended to a shoemaker named Ribham, in the Calle de
                            something or other, who would build an addition on them that would give
                            his great toe surcease of sorrow. Through the street of the silversmiths
                            we went, and then through the street of the shoemakers, in hot pursuit
                            of Mr. Ribham. Of course no other shoemaker knew of such a man, and they
                            all said the job couldn't be done. The colonel d&#151;d. them in
                            robust Anglo-Saxon for a set of pepper-eating, leather-mangling
                            dunderheads. He knew it could be done, because an American shoemaker had
                            told him it was feasible. An American dentist had told him the truth
                            about the possibility of replanting a tooth, and now he believed in the
                            reliability of American judgment in mechanical matters. Finally a
                            bright-eyed boy professed to know where Rib-ham's shop was, and started
                            to lead us thither. He <pb id="VAA3891-078" n="73"/> took us through
                            another street of shoemakers, past signs of the "Blue Boot," and the
                            "Pretty Little Red Boot," and a score of other endearing and seductive
                            titles. As he passed each shop the little scoundrel would closely scan
                            our countenances as we read the signs, to see if he had stumbled on the
                            right place. Finally he boldy led us in the last shop, with the
                            confident assertion that <hi rend="i">that</hi> was the place. The
                            colonel held a quarter between his thumb and finger, and was about to
                            drop it into the expectant palm of the little ruffian when he happened
                            to read an interior sign which bore the legend, "M. Gradt." He held his
                            quarter a little longer and inquired for Mr. Ribham. They didn't know
                            him and had never heard of him. The colonel turned on that boy, and in
                            his usual vigorous Anglo-Saxon gave him a concise "piece of his mind."
                            He held the gleaming coin up before his eyes, and impressed it on his
                            youthful mind that he should never clutch it. He hated a liar. But he
                            couldn't expect anything better of a descendant of the savages who shot
                            Maximilian. And then we started again. We would go into stores and
                            inquire if they parley-voo'd Francaise, or German, or English, and make
                            further inquiries for Ribham. Finally we got on his trail again, and
                            after weary wandering for a half hour, and enjoying the delightful
                            confusion which comes from the Mexican system of giving a street a fresh
                            name every square or two, we found Mr. Ribham's place, but, alas! he had
                            moved. A pretty little French-speaking woman gave us accurate
                            directions, but the colonel's dogged pertinacity <pb id="VAA3891-079"
                                n="74"/> was exhausted, and he acknowledged himself dead beat. On
                            our way to the hotel, however, we passed another shoe shop, in the
                            window of which was a pair of slippers made of the furred skin of some
                            wild animal. The beauty of the workmanship attracted our attention, and
                            once more we entered.</p>
                        <p>The shoemaker was an intelligent brown fellow with a German wife, who
                            talked fluent French and acted as interpreter. They didn't know Ribham,
                            but on learning the nature of the job required, the shoemaker
                            unhesitatingly announced his ability to do it. The colonel was delighted
                            to find a couple who had confidence in themselves, and to whom he could
                            make himself understood. He explained to the madame that he had suffered
                            inexpressible "<hi rend="i">douleur</hi>" on account of those shoes, and
                            returned once or twice after having started to again impress it on the
                            shoemaker to be sure and make them long enough. Our next exasperation
                            was trying to find the colored coachman who had brought us from the
                            depot, and who could speak English. We had his address, but couldn't
                            find the location, and none of his accursed competitors would direct us
                            there. Finally the colonel gave one of them a half dollar to go and
                            fetch him. He did bring a black fellow, but he couldn't speak a work of
                            English. Finally we got on the trail of an Englishman named Hawthorne,
                            who keeps a coach and acts as guide, and were driven to his house in the
                            Second Providencia. He was not at home, but his wife, a wholesome
                            English woman, assured us he would soon be in. She informed us that she
                            made <pb id="VAA3891-080" n="75"/> the mince and mutton pies for the
                            American and English residents in the city, while her husband acted as
                            coachman and guide. Presently Hawthorne himself came in&#151;a
                            fine-looking, stalwart Englishman, in a duck roundabout, corduroy
                            trousers and cavalry boots. We soon struck a bargain with
                            him&#151;$6 per day for his coach and a Mexican driver, and his own
                            services as guide and interpreter. We kept him during the rest of our
                            stay, and the colonel was so well pleased with him that he took him with
                            him to Havana and through Central America.</p>
                        <p>Having spent the greater part of the day in fuming and fretting, we
                            concluded to utilize the remainder by making a call on Dr. Harris at his
                            suburban residence, No. 6 Buena Vista, near the San Cosme gate. Taking a
                            street-car at the plaza we rode to the doctor's place, but being
                            apprehensive that it was a little too early, we strolled into a <hi
                                rend="i">Jardin des Plantes</hi> just opposite, kept by an
                            intelligent German. He had flowers of all kinds, and thousands of
                            eucalyptus and fruit trees; but what interested me more than anything
                            else was his display of orchids. Of these he had eighty different
                            varieties, a dozen or so of which were in bloom. The beauty of these
                            plants is beyond description. They were attached to blocks of wood, each
                            block cut from the tree which the particular orchid might happen to
                            prefer, and hung up like picture frames on the wall, where they grew and
                            flourished, drawing their sustenance from the air. Certainly they can
                            get little nutriment from the <pb id="VAA3891-081" n="76"/> dry blocks
                            of wood to which they are attached. The florist informed us that he had
                            sent a lot of these orchids to the great exposition in St. Petersburg.
                            They happened to get there in good condition, and attracted much
                            attention. The government was so well pleased that it voted him an
                            annual pension of two hundred roubles, on condition that he would each
                            year send a lot of orchids to their exposition. Mexico is the home of
                            the orchid. In the number of varieties and the beauty of individual
                            specimens it can beat the world. In the hot moist lands the more
                            gorgeous specimens are found, but the mountains are also full of them.
                            Miss Anna Harris, one of the doctor's daughters, (of whom he has four)
                            is making a painted collection of the orchids of Mexico, and proposes to
                            publish a large book, with costly colored plates, descriptive of them.
                            She is a talented artist; in fact three of the doctor's daughter's are
                            painters, one excelling in portraits, the other in landscapes, while
                            Anna's genius has its best field in the accurate and faithful
                            representation of plants and flowers. The work will be large and costly,
                            but no professional or amateur florist in Europe or America can afford
                            to be without it, and every lover of flowers will want it.</p>
                        <p>In strolling about the florist's grounds we found some gnarled and
                            twisted trees which looked as if they might have been sturdy saplings
                            when the Aztecs founded their capital. The colonel, who has seen olive
                            trees in Syria, Spain, Italy and France, was quite sure they were
                            olives. I picked <pb id="VAA3891-082" n="77"/> up some of the fruit
                            which lay under one of them, and bit into one of the specimens to see
                            what a fresh olive tasted like. I'll never do it again. It was a blasted
                            olive, and I spat and sputtered for the rest of the day in the vain
                            effort to get the taste out of my mouth. It was like a pill of socotrine
                            aloes and quinine, with a little tallow to make it hang together. The
                            member of the Kentucky legislature who offered a $25 reward at the Galt
                            House for the man who salted "them plums" was not half so disgusted. A
                            little further on we found about ten bushels of olives spread out to
                            cure for the oil press. The colonel assured me that these, which had not
                            been stung by the curculio, were not bitter&#151;and I took his word
                            for it. After having exhausted the attractions of the florist's we
                            crossed over to the doctor's, and a venerable Mexican who had been
                            twenty-five years in his service answered a punch of the pneumatic bell
                            from the colonel's cane. The doctor lives in a beautiful place,
                            embowered in flowers, embellished with fountains, and ornamented with
                            eucalyptus and other trees. There were great beds of violets that loaded
                            the air with their delicate perfume, and roses everywhere. The Mexican
                            roses, however, have no smell. The house is Spanish in
                            exterior&#151;thick walls, flat roofs, cream-colored stucco, grated
                            windows and all&#151;but in the interior it is American. It has
                            grates and chimneys, carpets and American furniture. The doctor is one
                            of those Mexicanized foreigners who spend half their leisure time in
                            eulogizing the Mexican climate and <pb id="VAA3891-083" n="78"/> the
                            other half in putting on and off their overcoats and shawls. Eternal
                            vigilance in hunting drafts has made him as nervous and excitable as a
                            woman. If there is anything he hates worse than a draft it is a forced
                            loan. He says he came to Mexico to recover his health, and to escape the
                            hurlyburly of American life, and, as the fellow who tried the whistling
                            cure for stammering jerked out between whistles, "you can see, stranger,
                            it has done it."</p>
                        <p>About five years of the twenty-seven he has lived in Mexico have been
                            spent in a state of siege, with contending factions holding different
                            sections of the city, and firing six pounders at each other from the
                            towers of the churches. There would be an intermission until ten o'clock
                            every morning for the people to go to market, and then the signal gun
                            would warn all the non-combatants to hunt their holes, and trouble would
                            begin again. Sixmonths of this calm and restful existence was enough to
                            make one forget the hurly-burly of American life, and we saw the good
                            effects of it in Dr. Harris. He reminded me of nothing so much as that
                            excitable piece of fireworks called a serpent, which jerks itself in
                            forty different directions in as many seconds. One morning while the
                            doctor was up on the roof of his house, building a furnace to be used in
                            his profession of dentistry, he observed a Mexican soldier in a
                            neighboring tower regarding him with an unusual degree of interest. The
                            fighting was going on all around him, but the doctor paid no attention,
                            for they generally re <pb id="VAA3891-084" n="79"/> spected
                            non-combatants; but the intentness of this tellow's stare finally
                            suggested to him that he had better retire. Before he had time to carry
                            out this determination, the soldier raised his rifle, and sent an ounce
                            of lead <hi rend="i">whizzing</hi> through his hair. Oh, this Mexican
                            life is very restful.</p>
                        <p>We had some music from the girls, examined their paintings, strolled
                            through the grounds, and spent an agreeable afternoon. The colonel was
                            so delighted with a Mexican song called "Las Penas de Corazon" (Pains of
                            the Heart) that he prevailed upon the girls to sing it again, and the
                            next day hunted it down to send to a lady friend in London. It is a
                            peculiar composition, the music wailing, and the words hot as Mexican
                                <hi rend="i">chile.</hi> We left Dr. Harris's with the impression
                            that he has a little local paradise of his own, but that we would not
                            care to live in it. The high walls surrounding the grounds and the
                            barred windows are all too suggestive of a prison. At six o'clock the
                            faithful servant is sent home, the gates closed, the drawbridge lowered,
                            and until three o'clock the next afternoon nobody can get in. They may
                            ring the bell to all eternity, but nobody will respond. This restful
                            life of Mexico has its little drawbacks.</p>
                        <p>The Mexican women of the lower strata have three great
                            industries&#151;rubbing corn into paste for <hi rend="i"
                                >tortillas,</hi> peddling lottery tickets and washing clothes. The
                            corn for the <hi rend="i">tortillas</hi> is first soaked in alkaline
                            water to soften it and remove the husk, and is then rubbed on a flat
                            stone, with a stone pestle held in both hands like a rolling pin, until
                            it is con <pb id="VAA3891-085" n="80"/> verted into soft pulp, in which
                            condition it is spread into thin cakes and baked without salt. The
                            result is the <hi rend="i">tortilla</hi> plain and simple, a tough
                            flapjack which a hungry man would be culpable to throw over his
                            shoulder, but which a well-fed <hi rend="i">gringo</hi> is not apt to
                            hanker after. The <hi rend="i">tortilla enchilada</hi> is a plain <hi
                                rend="i">tortilla</hi> embellished with a compound of pepper,
                            tomatoes and garlic, and made into a convenient roll. Making <hi
                                rend="i">tortilla</hi> paste seems to be a social and gregarious
                            employment, or it may be that certain establishments keep the tools, and
                            rent them for a price. At least I always found from one to a dozen women
                            in every room where the preparation of the corn was going on, all
                            rubbing for dear life, and rubbing with care. Lottery selling is done on
                            a commission, and the sellers, both male and female, confront you at
                            every turn, The wailing cry of "<hi rend="i">Luatro mil pesos!</hi>" is
                            eternally ringing in your ears. Everybody buys lottery tickets. These
                            people are so very poor, and their condition is so utterly hopeless,
                            that one can scarcely blame them for seizing even upon the most
                            desperate chance of emerging from it. One day a rather good-looking
                            young woman, whose audacity had been reinforced by numerous draughts of
                            pulque, tackled me in the street, and begged a medid "for the love of
                            God." On being asked what she wanted with it, she innocently replied,
                            "To buy a lottery ticket." Such refreshing candor was not to be
                            resisted; I hope she drew one-sixteenth of the capital prize. Natives
                            complain that foreigners, who buy tickets just for the fun of the thing
                            and don't need the money, <pb id="VAA3891-086" n="81"/> draw all the big
                            prizes&#151;another instance of the cruelty and capriciousness of
                            fate. The washing is mostly done in the open air. You see hundreds of
                            women strung along the banks of the ditches and canals engaged in this
                            laborious work, while their naked children, with round staring eyes and
                            protruding abdomens, roll in the dust. The women sit on their knees on
                            the bank, reach forward and dip the clothes in the water, and then rub
                            them on a flat stone. No more painful and uncomfortable position could
                            be devised, but your Mexican is awfully conservative, and very much in
                            favor of doing everything as it has been done for the last five hundred
                            years. The surface of the water in all these ditches is completely
                            covered with a purple <hi rend="i">conferva,</hi> while the banks are
                            hideously filthy, and the legs of an occasional dead dog or cat are seen
                            sticking up through the scum; but beneath, the water is found
                            comparatively clear. Besides the women engaged in these three leading
                            industries many of them compete with the men in their capacity of beasts
                            of burden, and carry loads that would make a pack-mule groan. Not
                            infrequently you see a slender woman carrying a pannier full of fruit on
                            her back, with a child tied up in her <hi rend="i">rebosa</hi> in front,
                            and maybe a full basket on one arm. The <hi rend="i">rebosa</hi> is a
                            long wide scarf which the Mexican women wind about the head and across
                            the bosom, thus making it answer the purpose of both shawl and hat.
                            Almost every woman you meet either carries a baby swung in the folds of
                            her shawl or else shows that she is in the line of promotion. <pb
                                id="VAA3891-087" n="82"/> Girls who seem but children themselves
                            have babies of which they are proud, though perhaps it would be
                            difficult to muster a husband for inspection if suddenly called on.
                            Women of the middle class seem to have little to do but sit at the
                            windows in the afternoon, embroider, a little, gabble a good deal, look
                            demure and flirt with any audacious <hi rend="i">gringo</hi> who may
                            kiss his hand to them.</p>
                        <p>The women of the upper class dress themselves in gorgeous array in the
                            afternoon, put on a bewildering quantity of laces and diamonds, and shut
                            themselves in close carriages to be driven along the <hi rend="i"
                                >paseo,</hi> past the statues of King Charles and Christopher
                            Columbus, on the Chapultepec road, then to turn and go over the ground
                            two or three times more. Women of high social position are usually
                            attended by wonderful masculine creatures of the genus <hi rend="i"
                                >caballero.</hi> One soon learns in Mexico to address a working man
                            as <hi rend="i">hombre,</hi> and to call a man in a higher walk of life
                                <hi rend="i">Senor.</hi> But when you want to be particularly
                            deferential, it is "the cheese" to call him <hi rend="i">caballero.</hi>
                            The <hi rend="i">caballero</hi> of the <hi rend="i">paseo</hi> is a
                            gaily-bedizened creature. He is dressed in the extremest agony of the
                            national costume&#151;gold-corded jacket and slashed pantaloons,
                            with buttons of silver; tremendous sombrero, with its awful band of gold
                            cord ; saddle and bridle richly ornamented with gold and silver, and a
                            keen rapier in a buff leather scabbard at his side. He can ride well,
                            and could fight a bull in the ring, but his principal use is to gallop
                            alongside of my lady's carriage, and talk at her through the open <pb
                                id="VAA3891-088" n="83"/> window. That rapier inspires a <hi
                                rend="i">gringo</hi> with wholesome respect. The <hi rend="i"
                                >caballero</hi> is chivalric in his bearing, and his mouth, an

                            has a chronic set, indicative of a high order of personal courage. But I
                            understand that when one of these bravos has occasion to travel in a
                            diligence, he puts on the plainest apparel, divests himself of his
                            ultimate weapon, and when called upon by the brigands to "shell out,"
                            lies flat on his face while they go through him. If they can attach
                            themselves to a party of Englishmen or Americans, however, with
                            Winchester rifles and the nerve to use them, they go through with flying

                            Juarez began in the confiscation of church property Lerdo finished in
                            the expulsion of the Sisters of Charity. The latter measure strikes even
                            the Protestant conscience as a hard, brutal expedient, but it was
                            probably needed to complete the work that Juarez began. As the women of
                            the South kept the fires of rebellion in full blaze long after the men
                            would have faltered and fainted, so did these saint-like fanatics keep
                            alive in the hearts of the common people a dangerous spirit of
                            resistance to the encroachments of the government on <pb
                                id="VAA3891-089" n="84"/> what they deem sacred things. In no
                            country on earth is there greater freedom of religious thought and
                            action than in the large cities of Mexico at the present time. To such
                            an extent has the revolution been carried that religious processions are
                            forbidden by law, and the priesthood are prohibited from appearing in
                            public in the peculiar costume&#151;black gown and immense shovel
                            hat&#151;which they used to wear. In the olden time the common
                            people would prostrate themselves in the dust when a procession passed,
                            and the foreigner who didn't get down of his own accord was pretty apt
                            to be knocked down; but now no body pays any more attention to a priest
                            than to any other man. They generally wear a plug hat and long circular
                            cloak of black cloth, with the right skirt thrown over the left
                            shoulder. Some of the younger of them present a rather jaunty
                            appearance. The first I saw I mistook for a lawyer; the next I put down
                            as a monte dealer, while the third, who was older and fatter, I was sure
                            was a cabinet minister. The priests are poor now. The churches have been
                            despoiled of their magnificent revenues, and the priests no longer get
                            any assistance from the state; but they stick manfully to the work. The
                            common people seem to be very devout. You rarely enter a church that you
                            don't find scores of poor laborers, many of them not having clothes
                            enough on them "to wad a shot-gun," kneeling before the shrine of their
                            favorite saint, and pouring out their starved and stunted souls in an
                            intensity of devotion which seems incomprehensible to us bar <pb

                            with the excitement of the Methodist mourner's bench. In this silent
                            worship the devotee has none of the spurs that are necessary with us to
                            goad the sluggish fancy into a canter. There is no pealing of the organ,
                            no eloquent exhortation from the lips of the minister. Having delivered
                            his load of charcoal or fruit, the peon drops in on his way home, gets
                            upon his knees, and for a quarter of an hour is oblivious of everything
                            save his worship. As you sit and watch this human beast of burden with
                            his clasped hands, closed eyes and lips in tremulous motion, you may
                            believe him ignorant and fanatical, but you cannot believe him insincere
                            or hypocritical.</p>
                        <p>Everywhere we mingled with these people at their devotions. We strove to
                            avoid offense as much as possible, but through ignorance we doubtless
                            shocked them many times by an apparent want of reverence for what they
                            consider sacred. But beyond a pained and hurt look now and then, they
                            made no sign. It is not likely that a party of Mexicans, having as
                            little veneration for our religion as we had for theirs, could take the
                            same liberties in our churches, without unpleasant consequences. So far
                            as I could see, the Methodists are becoming the most intolerant and
                            arrogant of all sects in Mexico. They are determined to make the most of
                            the "religious toleration" which has been established. They are
                            aggressive, and they push their outposts into the interior. Every now
                            and then they appeal to the government for <pb id="VAA3891-091" n="86"/>
                            protection. We called upon Dr. Butler, the general-in-chief of the
                            proselyting army. He could give us but little time, as he had an
                            appointment with President Diaz at three o'clock. On the succeeding
                            Sunday a new church was to be dedicated in a neighboring village, and
                            the "fanatics" had announced that if dedicated at all it would be
                            dedicated in "torrents of blood." The local authorities had been
                            appealed to, but declined to act, and the doctor had carried the matter
                            to the President himself. It was quite inspiriting to witness the gusto
                            with which the oily old gentleman told of the troubles in his "little
                            church around the mountain." He rubbed his hands together
                            enthusiastically as he dwelt on the "torrents of blood," and manifested
                            a holy impatience to be skinned and scalped in the Master's service. For
                            my part I didn't take the least bit of stock in the "torrents of blood."
                            From what I had seen of the stolidity of the average Mexican "fanatic,"
                            and his generally subdued and broken-down demeanor in religious and
                            political matters, I didn't believe he could be kicked into a revolt. So
                            far as I could learn but little real progress has been made in
                            proselyting Mexicans. Some adult converts have been gathered into the
                            fold, but a converted Mexican has about the same numerical value as a
                            converted Jew, and we all know how to rate the latter. Numerous orphans
                            have been educated in Methodism, and they are sincere believers. But
                            honest adult converts are scarcer than hen teeth. You might as well try
                            to change the color of a <pb id="VAA3891-092" n="87"/> Mexican's skin as
                            his religion, and with due deference to Dr. Butler, I do not think it is
                            desirable to change his religion. Catholicism can do more for savage
                            people than protestantism, and the lower class of Mexicans are still at
                            least half savage. Some of the means employed to gain a "foothold for
                            Christ" are at least questionable. On the wall of the palace fronting
                            the plaza are two large blackboards, and every morning there appears
                            upon them a tirade against the Catholic religion, written with chalk in
                            a clear, legible hand. Multitudes of the lower classes stop and read
                            these bulletins. Some read and pass on without making any sign; others
                            read and scowl; while some smile scornfully. No hostile demonstration is
                            ever made.</p>
                        <p>But is it right to trample the religious prejudices of this people under
                            foot in this offensive manner? Is it not a shameful abuse of toleration
                            ? If at some future time, when public sentiment is more inflammable,
                            there should be a mob in the city of Mexico, and a massacre of
                            protestants by the infuriated populace, there will arise a terrible howl
                            from every protestant pulpit in the land. I would be shocked, along with
                            the rest of my protestant brethren, but I wouldn't be much surprised.
                            There is nothing in the world that ignorant people hold so dear as their
                            religious beliefs, and nothing for which they will shed blood so
                            cheerfully. If I had my way I would enjoy my own religious belief and
                            let every other man enjoy his. I would discour <pb id="VAA3891-093"

                            else.</p>
                        <p>As the question of recognizing the Diaz government is still undetermined,
                            perhaps the deductions drawn from our necessarily superficial
                            observations may not be uninteresting. Porfirio Diaz, like Juarez, is an
                            Indian&#151;not a full blood, perhaps, but much more of an Indian
                            than a Castilian. In his younger days he was a pretty hard
                            case&#151;one of the church robbers of the Juarez administration. It
                            is alleged of him that he had church jewels of great value set in the
                            backs of the wooden chairs which formed a part of the rude furniture of
                            his unpretentious dwelling, the walls of which were adorned with
                            priceless pictures acquired in the same manner. But he is undoubtedly
                            the best soldier in Mexico since Miguel Miramon "tumbled" to the racket
                            of his indignant countrymen, along with Maximilian, on that fine June
                            morning in 1867&#151;a fact indubitably proved by the masterly
                            manner in which he hustled Lerdo out of the country in the late
                            unpleasantness. The more moderate people of the old church party now
                            give Diaz the credit of being honest, and it is generally admitted that
                            he has attained a nearer approach to order throughout the republic than
                            any recent president has done. He aims to conciliate, while at the same
                            time the iron hand is felt beneath the velvet glove. Regiments of troops
                            in the most startling variety of uniforms are kept moving from point to
                            point about the capital, while all the neighboring towns are full of
                            armed men. You are <pb id="VAA3891-094" n="89"/> never out of hearing of
                            the ear-torturing Mexican bugle. The soldiers are generally a
                            hard-looking set, but they are armed with modern weapons, well drilled,
                            and, under the comparatively strict discipline maintained, will fight.
                            If the malcontents of the Rio Grande border succeed in their nefarious
                            designs of involving us in another war with Mexico, it will not be such
                            a "walk over" as Scott and Taylor found it.</p>
                        <p>The army is paid regularly; everybody in the government service is paid ;
                            and there is money in the treasury&#151;a fact almost without
                            precedent in Mexican history. The poor people like Diaz better than any
                            ruler they have had since Maximilian, and for the same reason they liked
                            the blonde emperor&#151;because he gives them security, hears their
                            complaints and endeavors to have justice done them. The public voice is
                            almost unanimous in saying that Diaz is the best president they have had
                            for many a year, but you can't always trust the public voice in Mexico.
                            Generally the fellow who is in, is "the best ruler they ever had," and
                            even while they are praising him they may be preparing to blow him out
                            of the country. Some, while admitting that Diaz is honest, say he is
                            surrounded by the same stripe of turbulent adventurers who have kept the
                            republic in a tumult ever since it had an existence, and that they will
                            conspire against him as soon as they see, or think they see, an
                            opportunity of furthering their own selfish ends by so doing. As far as
                            stability is concerned, the Diaz government seems strong. There is more
                            security for life and prop <pb id="VAA3891-095" n="90"/> erty than there
                            has been for years. Indeed it would be hard to find a quieter or more
                            orderly place in any country than the city of Mexico. Just why there
                            should be any hesitation about recognizing Diaz as president of a
                            country in which <hi rend="i">pronuncia-mentos</hi> are as plenty as
                            thistles, and change is the rule, is a conundrum; but influences have
                            been at work to retard such recognition. To me the Christian name of the
                            president always had a disagreeable sound. It reminds me of
                            "perfidious." Singularly enough, the common people give the "r" the
                            sound of "d," and call him "Porfidio."</p>
                        <p>Much of the mercantile business of the city of Mexico is carried on by
                            Germans. There are many French and few Americans in business. There are
                            not over forty English-speaking residents. Major DeGress, of the <hi
                                rend="i">Armeria Americana,</hi> does a flourishing business in the
                            sale of pistols, carbines, swords and other cutlery. Many of the pistols
                            are enriched with a barbaric profusion of gold and silver ornaments, and
                            are sold to the brigands of the mountain roads, who get their money
                            easily and part with it freely. The major says his shop is an unfailing
                            barometer of the public feeling. When everything is quiet he sells
                            pistols to the common people and dandy swords to the gallants of the
                            paseo. When trouble is brewing there is a brisk sale of carbines. The
                            bulk of the trade of Mexico ought to be done by Americans, but they have
                            permitted the Germans and French to cut under them. There are about four
                            hundred German residents in the city, and the effect of their monop <pb

                            change of character which is quite in contrast to the staid, thrifty
                            Teuton of the States. The Mexicanized German is "on the hurrah." He gets
                            drunk like an American, buys champagne by the basket, and sactters his
                            money with a reckless profusion which would keep his own father from
                            knowing him.</p>
                        <p>We visited the German club house under the lead of Mr. Nieth, and found
                            it an immense establishment, with all the club features. They drink a
                            great deal of Anheuser's St. Louis beer at fifty cents a bottle, but it
                            is not so good in its imported condition as the native beer at a real.
                            The jewelry stores, the dry good stores, the tobacco shops and many
                            other establishments, all have a gay Parisian look. Indeed there is a
                            good deal of luxury in this city of poverty. At the <hi rend="i">Monte
                                de Piedad</hi>&#151;the government pawn-shop&#151;we saw
                            bushels and bushels of diamonds and other precious stones and valuables
                            of many kinds. It is said that many of the first families put the family
                            carriage in pawn when they want to redeem their diamonds to attend a
                            party, and then repawn the diamonds to release the carriage. Many
                            valuables are left here for safe keeping. Money is loaned on long time
                            at a low rate of interest. The <hi rend="i">Monte de Piedad</hi> is the
                            only institution of Mexico that has not at sometime been robbed. All the
                            various revolutions have spared it. It is true that Lerdo, just before
                            he ingloriously ran away in the night, leaving the city to the
                            victorious Diaz, "lifted" $25,000 out of it, but he claimed that it
                            belonged to the government. <pb id="VAA3891-097" n="92"/> They say that
                            this institution loans at a lower rate of interest than other
                            establishments, but nobody could tell me why the common people patronize
                            the hundreds of low pawn-shops which confront you on every street in
                            preference to the <hi rend="i">Monte de Piedad</hi> when they want to
                            raise a medio to buy a lottery ticket. I suspect that the <hi rend="i"
                                >Piedad</hi> is too "toney" for them. These low pawn-shops are good
                            places for the study of Mexican nature. Nobody is so poor but he has
                            something to pawn, and articles are received and money loaned on them
                            which our "starving poor" would not pick up in the street.</p>
                        <p>Quite naturally I was interested in the newspapers of Mexico. There are
                            plenty of them, but they are, typographically and editorially, queer
                            specimens. They have neither local nor telegraphic news to speak of, but
                            are ponderous in the way of "leader" and literary lore. The absence of
                            local news is a distressing feature. You scan their pages in vain for
                            accounts of fires, murders, public meetings, reviews of troops,
                            political meetings, court reports, or any other events which with us go
                            to make up the local columns. A bull fight, if it is a good one, is
                            eulogized to the extent of a dozen lines. If a poor one, the <hi
                                rend="i">Monitor</hi> of Monday will dismiss it with a paragraph
                            like the following: "The bull fight at Tlalnepanlta on yesterday was <hi
                                rend="i">mala malissima.</hi>" There are no theatrical criticisms,
                            no notices of coming events. The editors sit in their offices two or
                            three hours a day, and evolve from their seething brains incon <pb
                                id="VAA3891-098" n="93"/> sequential paragraphs about nothing in
                            particular. They do manage to collect a little news from the interior,
                            either by working over their exchanges or interviewing the drivers of
                            the diligences, but if anything ever happens in the city it is
                            studiously suppressed. Events in which the President takes a part, like
                            the distribution of prizes at the Academy of Arts, are briefly noticed,
                            but a last year's almanac answers the purpose of an "abstract and brief
                            chronicle of the times" quite as well as a Mexican daily, fresh from the
                            press.</p>
                        <p>After we had been three weeks away from home without hearing anything
                            from the outside world, I began to be a little anxious about the war in
                            Europe, the silver bill, Hayes' policy and other matters; so I took to
                            the Mexican papers in search of telegraphic news. I knew that there was
                            a telegraphic line from the United States to the city by way of
                            Matamoras, and remembered to have seen a boast in one of the Mexican
                            papers of having published a dispatch from St. Petersburg which came
                            through in one day. For four days I looked in vain. On the fifth,
                            patient perseverance was rewarded. In the <hi rend="i">Diario</hi> I
                            found two dispatches of about three lines each. One was from London.
                            announcing that the relations between England and Russia were still
                            "cordial," and the other chronicled a tremendous fire in Greenville,
                            Mississippi, in Which a country store and a dwelling house were licked
                            up by the "devouring element." The patronage of the Mexican papers is
                            limited. The <hi rend="i">Monitor,</hi> which is the leading
                            "independent" <pb id="VAA3891-099" n="94"/> paper, boasts of the
                            enormous circulation of 2,500, and is admitted on all hands to be the
                            most popular and influential journal in the republic. Advertising
                            patronage is small. A newspaper is the last place to look for
                            information about anything. The book and pamphlet publishing business,
                            however, is better. Much of the information, which in the United States
                            seeks an outlet through the newspapers, in Mexico, finds its way to the
                            public through the medium of a book or pamphlet.</p>
                        <p>The newsboy has no existence in Mexico. Occasionally a man is encountered
                            wailing forth the information that he has the <hi rend="i">Monitor</hi>
                            for sale, but when you want a newspaper, as a general thing, you have to
                            get out a search warrant before you can find it. The <hi rend="i"
                                >Socialists</hi> I accidentally stumbled on one morning while taking
                            chocolate in a third-class fonda. Its editorials are of the jerky
                            character, which seems peculiar to journals devoted to the rights of
                            man. The number I saw sneered at "strong governments," and demanded to
                            know if workingmen were slaves. I encountered the "iron heel" of
                            despotism two or three times within a column, and then butted against a
                            word which I couldn't make out. It was used in connection with
                            "capitalist," and I am sure it must have been the Spanish equivalent for
                            "bloated." As I sat there sipping the delicious chocolate, which is
                            found nowhere save in Mexico, and nibbling at the roll of light, sweet
                            bread, a contented, home-like feeling stole over me. The <hi rend="i"
                                >Two Republics</hi> is an excellent paper considering its
                            opportunities. It is published by Major George W. Clarke, one of the
                            incorrig <pb id="VAA3891-100" n="95"/> ible southern refugees, who had
                            to come to Mexico to get reconciled to the old flag. The <hi rend="i"
                                >Shakespearean Bugle</hi> is a manuscript paper, published by the

                        <p>E<hi rend="sc">VERY</hi> American who visits Mexico must see at least one
                            bull fight. He never wants to see another&#151;unless for the
                            purpose of assuring himself that it is just like the first. P. had
                            witnessed the noble sport in Mexico thirty years ago. The colonel had
                            seen bull fights in Madrid. I alone had the new sensation in store for
                            me. Large posters, announcing a bull fight at Tlalnepantla, the proceeds
                            to be devoted to the "payment of the American indemnity," covered the
                            walls. It was further announced that President Diaz would be present. A
                            balloon ascension served to inflate the attractions. As the fight would
                            come off in the afternoon, we determined to put in the forenoon in a
                            drive up the canal. The day was all that could be
                            desired&#151;clear, cloudless and balmy&#151;and as we drove
                            through the southeastern gate, and took our way alongside of that
                            wonderful canal, the history of which was a matter of vague tradition
                            when the Spaniards first visited the capital, I never felt a keener
                            sense of purely physical enjoyment. This canal is probably forty feet
                            broad but shallow. It <pb id="VAA3891-101" n="96"/> connects Lake Chalco
                            with the city, and is used for irrigation and for the transportation of
                            produce. On this bright Sunday morning it teemed with busy life.
                            Hundreds of flat-bottomed boats, loaded with great stacks of green
                            clover, fruits, vegetables and poultry, dotted its surface, being
                            "poled" along by bare-legged natives, in the old-fashioned keel-boat
                            style, while here and there some velvet-jacketed and bell-buttoned
                            ranchero lolled lazily in the stern of a more luxurious gondola,
                            propelled by a half-naked peon. A courteous salute startles the hidalgo
                            out of his lazy dream, and with a precipitance which is almost
                            indecorous, he removes the cigarette from his lips, lifts the
                            broad-brimmed and heavily-silvered sombrero, and returns our greeting
                            with an effusive politeness that is almost ludicrous.</p>
                        <p>The roadside is dotted with villages, some of them very neat and clean,
                            and all of them having the inevitable church, its tiled dome glistening
                            in the bright sunshine, and its floors crowded with kneeling worshipers.
                            Now and then a peripatetic butcher shop, consisting of a little jackass
                            and a saddle, above which is an iron framework, upon each of its
                            half-dozen hooks hanging a sheep or a quarter of beef, goes by, the
                            driver jogging along behind the patient little quadruped. The country is
                            in a high state of cultivation, and a piece of ground but little bigger
                            than a Brightwood lot is made to support scores of men and beasts. We
                            come to a point where a Mexican warns us that the carriage can proceed
                            no further on account <pb id="VAA3891-102" n="97"/> of a broken bridge.
                            Our driver accuses him of having purposely "fixed" the bridge. He calls
                            upon all the saints to witness that he did nothing of the kind, but a
                            cunning leer in his eyes gives color to our guide's accusations. It is a
                            common practice, we learn, for the shrewd descendants of Montezuma to
                            play these little tricks, so as to get a chance to hire their boats. A
                            dicker is made with him for transportation, and soon we are in one of
                            the broad-bottomed boats, and being poled rapidly up the canal. By and
                            by we come to the famous "floating gardens." If they ever did float they
                            no longer do so. Possibly they shake beneath the tread in the rainy
                            season, for this entire valley is a morass; but in the dry season they
                            are solid. There are merely bits of real estate, probably fifty feet
                            wide and two hundred long, surrounded by ditches wide enough to enable
                            the proprietor to circumnavigate them in his canoe. We are amazed at the
                            luxuriance of vegetation. The freshness and greenness of
                            things&#151;remembering that the month is January, and in our own
                            country is ice and snow&#151;is a tireless wonder. As we pass, some
                            of the laborers are irrigating by throwing water over their plats with a
                            wooden shovel, and some are picking vegetables for market; for in this
                            country labor never ceases with the poor, except, possibly, on feast
                            days. By and by we come to a large meadow full of cattle, in which some
                            half-dozen Mexicans, in full costume, are practicing with the lasso. It
                            is a sight we have longed to see, and so the boat is landed, <pb
                                id="VAA3891-103" n="98"/> and we start across the field to attain a
                            point for closer observation. The expertness of the Mexicans in throwing
                            the lasso has often been chronicled, and has been but little
                            exaggerated. It is a deadly weapon in the hands of the robber, as well
                            as an expert means of discipline in the hands of the herdsman. These
                            fellows would select a bullock from the herd&#151;they were all
                            moderately fat and in good condition for keeping up their part of the
                            sport&#151;and then the fun would begin. While at full gallop a
                            lasso would be thrown around the bullock's horns, and simultaneously
                            another would fasten on a hind leg. The sudden jerk would turn him a
                            summersault on the grass. Rapidly releasing the ropes by stooping from
                            the saddle at full gallop, the beast would be started and thrown again,
                            the riders all the time keeping up a fire of jeering epithets. Finally
                            when he was worn out, another victim would be selected, and the same
                            programme gone through with. We watched the game until it began to get
                            monotonous. A suggestion to retire was somewhat accelerated by the
                            interest a vicious black bullock began to take in our party. He had been
                            lassoed until he was disgusted, but, having recovered from the rattling
                            they had given him, he fancied he saw in our dismounted party an
                            opportunity for getting even. With many pawings, and scrapings, and
                            angry tossings of his head, he began to approach. We retired,
                            judiciously, but with considerable celerity, a fortunate trend of the
                            lassoing party in the direction <pb id="VAA3891-104" n="99"/> of our
                            bovine friend having made a diversion in our favor.</p>
                        <p>In the boat once more we were poled back to the point where the carriage
                            had been left, at the little village of Yxtacalco, where Hawthorne had
                            made arrangements for a Mexican breakfast.</p>
                        <p>The feeding at the restaurants is all French, and the dishes peculiar to
                            the country are not to be had except on special order. While waiting for
                            breakfast we strolled into a <hi rend="i">pulque</hi> shop, gaily
                            bedizened with painted figures before which the gaudy coloring of the
                            she Justices of the Peace in our own two-million court house would pale
                            their ineffectual fires. Among the decorations was a gorgeously-dressed
                            female in short dancing costume holding out a glass to a frisking goat,
                            with the invitation: "<hi rend="i">Tomo hijo tu pulquito?</hi>" The goat
                            seems to hold the same place in relation to Mexican <hi rend="i"
                                >pulque</hi> that he does with us in celebrating the peculiar
                            properties of bock beer. A Mexican colonel, with some of the inferior
                            officers, had selected this point for a Sunday picnic, and an advanced
                            force of privates had been all morning busily engaged in decorating a
                            neighboring shed with flowers and streamers for the fandango. By and by
                            the procession came up the canal&#151;two large flat-bottomed boats,
                            with a brass band in active eruption. The colonel, black and burly, sat
                            on a sort of raised platform, surrounded by his seraglio, and the other
                            officers, each attended by their female partners, were near him. The
                            band landed first, formed in two lines, and through the lane, under a
                            triumphal arch decorated <pb id="VAA3891-105" n="100"/> with flowers,
                            the colonel and his invited guests passed. It was a gay party.</p>
                        <p>By and by our own breakfast was brought, and with keenly whetted
                            appetites we sat down to it. There was rice in Mexican fashion; an
                            omelet; wild ducks, with their broad bills and feet left on to prove it;
                            tortillas enchilada, very hot; a capon with sauce of chile mulata, very
                            black, and still hotter; bread of the country and fruit. The bread of
                            the country is sweet but a little heavy&#151;not nearly so good as
                            the delicious French bread we get at the restaurants. Among the fruits
                            were the avocado pear, a pear-shaped, marrowy substance, which makes not
                            a bad substitute for butter.</p>
                        <p>It was two o'clock when we returned to the city, after a most delightful
                            morning. Tlalnepantla, where the bull fight was to take place, is nine
                            miles out. A train of twenty-eight street cars conveyed the people to
                            the suburbs, where a steam engine took charge of the train. The cars
                            were crowded, and a great many went in carriages, while thousands of the
                            poorer classes walked. The admittance was one dollar on the shady side,
                            fifty cents in the sun. I told the gate-keeper that I was an American,
                            and as the fight was for the benefit of the American indemnity, I would
                            just remit my portion of the indemnity and say no more about it if he
                            would remit the entrance fee, but he said it wasn't visible to the
                            Castilian eye. So I contributed my dollar to the American indemnity, and
                            passed in, where a new and strange scene opened out before me. The
                            amphitheater is exactly <pb id="VAA3891-106" n="101"/> like that of the
                            old-fashioned Kentucky fair, except that a wooden wall protects the
                            spectators from the onslaughts of the bull.</p>
                        <p>About five thousand people were inside. On the sunny side were gathered
                            the riff-raff of Mexico, while on the more aristocratic side were to be
                            seen many richly-dressed ladies with opera-glasses, and well-dressed
                            gentlemen. Peddlers passed constantly through the rows of seats, selling
                            plumes of colored paper, sweets, fruit, <hi rend="i">pulque</hi> and
                            other refreshments. An old-fashioned fire balloon, about half inflated,
                            was swaying to and fro in the arena. It was getting late, and the crowd
                            was becoming impatient. Hoarse cries of "<hi rend="i">El Toro!</hi>"
                            rent the air, while thousands of throats, which seemed as if ready to
                            split with the tension, demanded that "<hi rend="i">El Globo</hi>"
                            should be instantly taken out. They did not care a cent for the balloon
                            ascension, but were impatient for the blood and entrails of the bull
                            fight. The uproar became demoniac. Well-dressed gentlemen on the shady
                            side of the amphitheater roared themselves hoarse. By and by the
                            aeronaut came out and inspected the balloon. If he had ever intended to
                            make an ascension, it was now evident that the enterprise was a failure.
                            He turned to seek cover again. Just at this point an orange, well-aimed
                            and flying at a high velocity, smashed itself on his bullet head. He
                            stood not on the order of his going, but went at once. The crowd roared
                            with laughter. Then the attendants began to clear the balloon away.
                            Oranges, bananas, pomegranates, bits of <pb id="VAA3891-107" n="102"/>
                            sugar-cane and sweet turnips began to fly like hail. Then the little
                            fragile earthen pitchers, used to peddle <hi rend="i">pulque</hi> began
                            to follow, and by and by missiles of a more dangerous character. The
                            boys engaged in clearing away the balloon and the furnace used to
                            inflate it, took the storm of missiles good-humoredly. When anything hit
                            them, they looked to see the nature of the projectile. If it was an
                            orange, or anything eatable, they chased it and stowed it away. If
                            something solider and more indigestible, they simply rubbed the sore
                            place and went on with their work. By and by, some murderous wretch
                            threw a heavy brandy bottle and hit a little boy on the shoulder. Had it
                            hit him in the back of the head it would certainly have killed him. A
                                <hi rend="i">pulque</hi> pitcher smashed itself on the head of a
                            full-grown fellow, very black and with an evil countenance. His white
                            teeth gleamed as he turned to the point from whence the projectile had
                            come, and with features distorted with rage that seemed truly infernal,
                            he broke out in a storm of obscene abuse. He was greeted with a roar of
                            derisive laughter and a shower of missiles. Dodging the pots and
                            bottles, he rammed his hand in his pocket as if to clench a pistol, and
                            made believe he was going to shoot. The audience responded with more
                            missiles, and he finally found it so hot that he had to bolt. At this
                            point the trumpet sounded, and an instantaneous hush fell upon the
                            turbulent assembly. There seemed to be some difficulty in getting the
                            rst bull out of the chute, but he finally came with <pb id="VAA3891-108"
                                n="103"/> a bound, stopped in the middle of the arena, and took an
                            astonished survey of the situation.</p>
                        <p>He was a little brown fellow, and did not seem to be particularly
                            vicious. But the sight of the multitude, the banderillos and picadors,
                            began to tell on him, and he indicated his displeasure by a vigorous
                            pawing of the earth. A banderillo approached him, and shook a banner in
                            his face. He made a vicious lunge, which was easily dodged. A picador,
                            mounted on a sixty-cent horse whose flanks were protected by leathern
                            armor, now approached him. The bull made a lunge at the horse's flank,
                            and was caught on the point of a pike. The sharp pain was more than he
                            bargained for. He went tearing around the ring like mad, occasionally
                            making a lunge at one of the banderillos. Then the darts were fastened
                            in his shoulder. This is an operation requiring considerable courage,
                            skill and presence of mind. A banderillo took a dart in each hand, the
                            shaft being about two feet long, and covered with a network of
                            bright-colored paper; he attracted the bull's attention, and, as he made
                            his charge, adroitly reached over his horns, planted a dart in either
                            side of his neck, and stepped aside in time to avoid the tips of the
                            horns. Maddened with the pain, the bull tore madly about the ring,
                            bellowing loudly. Finally he took position on the soft earth where the
                            furnace for inflating the balloon had stood, and no amount of strategy
                            or aggravation could dislodge him. In vain the picadors tempted him, and
                            in vain the banderillos flaunted their banners in his face. If a
                            tempting <pb id="VAA3891-109" n="104"/> chance to insert a horn drew him
                            a few feet from his place of refuge, he soon retreated. In the meantime
                            the matador (a little cuss dressed up like a clown), whose duty it was
                            to administer the final <hi rend="i">coup de grace</hi> to the bull with
                            a sword, had been monkeying around the ring to no purpose. The audience
                            became impatient, and a hoarse roar for "<hi rend="i">Un Otro!</hi>"
                            went up from a thousand throats. The bull had funked, and must give way
                            to another. He had done no harm and suffered little. Once or twice his
                            horns had touched the flanks of the equine skeletons ridden by the
                            picadors, but the protecting leather had saved their miserable lives. As
                            for himself, the blood was streaming from a dozen pike wounds, yet he
                            was not seriously hurt. But it is the rule to never permit a bull to
                            leave the ring alive, unless he has killed a man. The trumpet sounded,
                            and we waited to see the matador take his sword and kill the toro. But
                            that official disdained to kill so tame a creature. So two caballeros,
                            mounted on good horses, rode in. One lassoed the bull by the head and
                            the other by the hind leg. He was thrown and stretched at full length in
                            the dust.</p>
                        <p>While I was wondering what next, a fellow approached, drew a two-edged
                            dirk, and deliberately proceeded to drive it into poor toro's spinal
                            column, just behind the horn. My soul turned sick with horror at the
                            assassination. The body was dragged out and No. 2 came in with a bound.
                            This bull was a better specimen, and made it interesting for the
                            performers. Once or twice he <pb id="VAA3891-110" n="105"/> nearly
                            overturned the equine skeletons, and once he made a flying attempt to
                            leap the barrier and get at the audience. One of the banderillos
                            displayed considerable skill. He would hold his banner before the
                            enraged creature and avoid a series of five or six successive lunges.
                            You could hardly see how it was done. This one, too, finally had enough
                            of the pikes, and took refuge in the soft earth and could not be coaxed
                            out. Once he failed to take advantage of an opportunity to get even with
                            one of his tormentors. A banderillo stepped on a round stick, which
                            turned with him, and he fell flat in the dust, not more than ten feet
                            from the bull. The party of the first part happened to be engaged in
                            watching the motions of a picador just then, but he heard the fall, and
                            turned to see what it was. He saw his opportunity, but a little too
                            late. By the time he got there his agile enemy was on foot again. This
                            bull was killed in the same horrible and atrocious manner as the first,
                            the matador disdaining to stain his sword with the blood of a scrub. No.
                            3 was the best of the lot, and after a gallant fight the matador was
                            called on to dispatch him, but declined. The animal wasn't quite up to
                            his standard. One of the banderillos took the weapon, and, provoking the
                            bull to several charges, made a number of thrusts at its heart, but
                            failed to reach the vital spot. After which it was lassoed, stretched
                            and butchered like the rest. No. 4 was but a repetition of the
                            experiences. No. 5 was turned over to the rabble. They sprang over the
                            barriers by scores, and soon the ring was full. <pb id="VAA3891-111"
                                n="106"/> They shook their ragged blankets in the bull's face, and
                            dodged his charges like the regular fighters had done. Finally one
                            ragamuffin seized the bull's tail, and in less than a second you could
                            not see that bull for the human flies that covered him. They held him by
                            the nose, the neck, the tail, the horns, and a half dozen mounted his
                            back. Finally the tail-hold was suddenly released, and the bull shook
                            off his tormenters. There was another chase and another capture. At this
                            point we left to secure a seat in the train. Alas! We were too late.
                            There was not room for a grasshopper. Fortunately we found a coach, and
                            after a two hours' drive over the road by which Cortez retreated, by the
                                <hi rend="i">arbor triste,</hi> we reached the city.</p>

                        <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> standard "show places" about Mexico had to be
                            visited, of course. But as many pens "more abler" than mine, as Uncle
                            J&#151;would say, have described them, I will deal gently with the
                            erring reader who follows me through these straggling "Notes." We did
                            the great cathedral, and saw its immense railings of silver and gold;
                            its beautiful pictures; its onyx basins for holy water; its gorgeous
                            gilding; its massive architecture; its great bells, and its rude wooden
                            doors which would disgrace a Pennsylvania barn. From its towers we <pb
                                id="VAA3891-112" n="107"/> saw the loveliest panorama in the
                            world&#151;Popocatapetl and the "White Lady," Chapultepec, Molino
                            del Rey, Guadalupe, Tacubaya, and the city itself&#151;spread out
                            before us like a map. From this altitude we got a glimpse of the
                            housetop life of the Mexicans. Some of the flat terraces were converted
                            into blooming gardens, while on others cooking, washing, clothes-drying,
                            and other industrial pursuits were being carried on. We visited the
                            museum and saw the Aztec weapons, idols, picture writing and the great
                            Sacrificial Stone, on which sixty thousand human beings are said to have
                            been offered up to appease the god of war. With the remembrance of
                            Prescott's description fresh in my mind it seemed as if I could smell
                            the stench of the sacrificial blood in the air. Through that trench cut
                            in the face of the stone what a flood of human blood has flowed, as the
                            priests tore the reeking heart from the breasts of the victims! But
                            hold! The iconoclast is after the Sacrificial Stone. He says the trench
                            cut from the center to its periphery, and supposed to have been used to
                            convey the blood, was an after-thought, and he proves it, or thinks he
                            proves it, by calling attention to the fact that it divides the

                            are inscribed. But it is not my fight. We visited the Palace, the Monte
                            de Piedad and the postoffice. We saw Guadalupe, the <hi rend="i">via
                                sacra</hi> along which penitents used to crawl on their hands and
                            knees to propitiate the Virgin; the blanket of Juan Diego upon which the
                            Virgin imprinted her image, now framed as a <pb id="VAA3891-113" n="108"
                            /> picture; the iron baths, the waters of which taste like those of
                            Saratoga. Penon de los Banos was not neglected. It is a volcanic hill of
                            almost solid iron ore, covered with a poisonous cactus burr, the sharp
                            spines of which work their way through the stoutest leather into the
                            flesh. In caves around the base of the hill dwell the ladrones,
                            nominally employed in making saltpetre from the nitrous earth which
                            abounds, but ready to engage in any nefarious work which promises pelf.
                            The daylight visitor can get off with a moderate donation in the shape
                            of <hi rend="i">backsheesh.</hi> One of them, a lusty, barelegged and
                            bare-footed fellow with the agility of a mountain goat, fastened himself
                            on our party and insisted on showing us over the hill.</p>
                        <p>On being asked how he escaped getting his bare feet full of the cactus
                            spines while our boots bristled like fretful porcupines, he answered,
                            with a droll laugh, that he "kept his eyes open." It is said that when a
                            fresh revolution is "on," three hundred rifles come out of Penon. Near
                            by are the hot baths. An outlet from the internal fires of Popocatapetl
                            boils up here, and the waters are in high repute for the cure of
                            rheumatism and skin diseases. The buildings are old and massive, and the
                            various chambers seem like caves. There are no accommodations for
                            patients save coarse food. Occasionally one comes out for a week's
                            treatment, bringing his bedding with him; but the solitude and the
                            surroundings are enough to counteract the benefits of the waters. It is
                            a wild, ugly place, and I should want to have an iron-clad throat to be
                                <pb id="VAA3891-114" n="109"/> caught there after nightfall. There
                            is a ruined chapel attached to the establishment, on the walls of which
                            hang some really meritorious pictures, slit in numerous places by knife
                            thrusts and bayonet stabs. Chapultepec was also visited, with its great
                            spring, its giant cypress trees, under one of which was Montezuma's
                            favorite loafing place, and other curiosities. Our guide was a former
                            servant of Mr. Barron, and he took us through his place at Tacubaya.
                            Barron is one of the English builders of the railroad. He spent near a
                            million of dollars in converting a volcanic hill into an earthly
                            paradise. The house is furnished like an emperor's palace, and many an
                            art gallery has a poorer show of pictures. Some of them are genuine
                            Murrillos, each one of which cost a prince's ransom. No visitor ever
                            leaves Mexico without making a pilgrimage to the <hi rend="i">Arbor
                                Triste.</hi> It is a great cypress tree, possibly a thousand years
                            old, at the little village of Popotla, a few miles from the city. Here
                            it was that the lion heart of Hernan Cortez gave way as he gathered the
                            pitiful remnant of his command about him after the disastrous retreat of
                                <hi rend="i">La Noche Triste.</hi> The causeway along which the
                            Spaniards retreated, assailed on every side by hundreds of thousands of
                            Indians, whose distorted faces were lighted up by the glare of the
                            temple fires, is now one of the principal streets of Mexico, and the
                            exact spot where Alvarado made his great leap, is pointed out to the
                            tourist. Tradition says that having for the time baffled his pursuers,
                            Cortez hitched his horse to a drooping limb of this gigantic <pb
                                id="VAA3891-115" n="110"/> tree, and wept like a child. It is a sad
                            wreck of its former self&#151;a gnarled and twisted shell, the core
                            of it having been eaten out by fire. There are two stories of its
                            misfortune. One is that Indians built a fire to cook their tortillas,
                            and another is that Maximilian and some friends were admiring it one
                            day, and a malicious scoundrel fired it purposely, for no other reason
                            than because the emperor derived pleasure from looking at it. Though a
                            mere shell, the sap still circulates through its surface veins, and the
                            leaves are green. Since the fire the government has built an iron
                            railing about it&#151;another instance of locking the stable after
                            the horse is stolen.</p>
                        <p>While we were looking at the venerable tree, and trying to imagine the
                            feelings of the little band of <hi rend="i">conquistadores</hi> who
                            gathered under it on that disastrous night, a young Indian woman, with
                            arms and legs that Venus would envy and a face of which the devil would
                            be ashamed, came and offered us fresh <hi rend="i">pulque.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Modesty, as we understand it, is a plant that doesn't seem to thrive in
                            the rarified atmosphere of Mexico. The lower classes discharge the
                            functions, which Henry Ward Beecher says were imposed on man for his
                            humiliation, without the least sense of shame, and in the most public
                            places. Maximilian made a determined effort at reform in this
                            particular, and succeeded to a great extent in rescuing the city from
                            the most offensive forms of indecency; but a drive along any one of the
                            great highways will reveal enough in a single morning to establish the
                                <pb id="VAA3891-116" n="111"/> fact that modesty is not the crown
                            jewel of Mexican character. It is the law of compensation. You see all
                            around you the sublimest landscape in the world, its rugged features
                            softened by a lavish display of flowers and vegetation. Perhaps the
                            specimens of living statuary which line the roadside are needed to
                            remind us that we are still human&#151;that the trail of the serpent
                            is over all. In their love-making Mexicans are equally innocent of any
                            suspicion of the impropriety of public demonstrations. You see couples
                            walking through the crowded plaza with their arms about each other's
                            necks, totally oblivious of their surroundings. Except among foreigners,
                            such exhibitions excite no comment. Driving along the Guadalupe road one
                            afternoon, we came upon a strapping fellow seated by the roadside, with
                            a young girl lying beside him, her head resting in his lap. As we
                            passed, she turned her face up to his, reached upward, and with a
                            shapely hand patted the impassive brute on his lantern jaw&#151;he
                            all the time gazing stolidly at the passing carriage. "You dog!" roared
                            the exasperated colonel. But the dog maintained his equanimity all the
                            same. At another time, while riding out to the iron baths on a street
                            car, we encountered a young couple bedecked in gay holiday ribbons and
                            clean clothes, walking down the broad road-way with their arms lovingly
                            clasped about each other's necks. She was young and quite handsome, and
                            he was young and carried in his unoccupied hand a pitcher of <hi
                                rend="i">pulque,</hi> stray drops of which were sprinkled along the
                            road. Evidently <pb id="VAA3891-117" n="112"/> a couple of lovers
                            returning from a pilgrimage to the shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe,
                            slightly the worse for their potations. Their arms were twined about
                            each other's necks for mutual support as well as to demonstrate their
                            affection.</p>
                        <p>They walked pretty steadily, however, though with that obliviousness of
                            demeanor which we see in more civilized drunkards when they try to play
                            it on the people and think they are succeeding. We watched our two
                            lovers from the rear of the car, and saw their steps grow gradually
                            unsteady until they began to totter and weave. After drinking a half
                            dozen glasses of the effervescent water fresh from the bubbling spring
                            we took another street car for the city. We had forgotten all about our
                            two lovers until we came upon them, again lying prone upon the ground by
                            the roadside, their arms still lovingly intertwined, and their cheeks
                            together, the pitcher broken at the fountain, and a tortuous streak of
                            moist earth showing where the <hi rend="i">pulque</hi> had meandered
                            away. I may as well state once more, however, that helpless drunkenness
                            is an uncommon sight in Mexico, notwithstanding the oceans of <hi
                                rend="i">pulque</hi> consumed every day. Once I saw a half-naked
                            Indian lying on his face in the street in front the plaza, dead drunk.
                            The coachmen considerately drove around him, the herds of panniered
                            asses stepped tenderly to one side, and no one seemed to think the sight
                            worthy of comment. On another occasion an old gray-headed woman,
                            bare-armed and bare-legged, with a petticoat of blue stuff about her
                            body, tottered on the <pb id="VAA3891-118" n="113"/> sidewalk in front
                            of me, gave a lurch and pitched headlong into the street. She had a few
                            little trinkets wrapped up in a handkerchief, which were scattered in
                            the fall. Rising upon her knees, she began groping blindly about to
                            recover them. I have never seen a more pathetic sight, or one that left
                            a deeper impression, unless it was that of a poor fellow whom I saw the
                            morning after my arrival. He was thin of limb and face, and seemed less
                            intelligent than the average "greaser." His entire wardrobe consisted of
                            what looked like a piece of worn-out rag carpet tied around his trunk,
                            and reinforced at the hips with a bit of old leather tied on with
                            strings. Hat, shirt, coat, pantaloons and shoes he had none. He had a
                            little bundle of sticks, scarcely more than you could grasp in one hand,
                            tied up with a cord, and was kneeling on the pavement to readjust the
                            fastenings. He looked so utterly and hopelessly miserable&#151;he
                            was so shamefully and squalidly poor&#151;it made me sick at heart.
                            The poor devil submitted stolidly to a critical inspection, and seemed
                            stricken dumb when I gave him a quarter. By and by he recovered his
                            tongue, and began an eloquent invocation of all the saints in my behalf,
                            which lasted until I got out of ear-shot, and may be running yet for
                            aught I know.</p>
                        <p>The Mexican women of the lower classes are exempt from the special
                            diseases which embitter the lives of their more civilized sisters. None
                            of them have "weak backs" and kindred ailments. The <hi rend="i"
                                >modiste</hi> who would attempt to fit a silk dress to one <pb
                                id="VAA3891-119" n="114"/> of their forms, would have no use for
                            cotton or other padding. In Mexico, canary seed is devoted to its
                            legitimate use. Many a high-born dame would give her hopes of salvation
                            for the development which is so lavishly displayed by the tortilla
                            grinders of Mexico. Civilization, coupled with a slavish subservience to
                            idiotic and murderous fashion, would doubtless soon reduce them to the
                            helpless condition of our own hot-house flowers. But must civilization
                            necessarily carry with it the curse of disease? One noticeable feature
                            of Mexican life is the absence of little girls of the better class from
                            the streets. The <hi rend="i">ninas</hi> seem to be all caged in
                            schools, and are jealously guarded until they are grown to be young
                            ladies and safely married. Now and then we pass a couple of dark-eyed
                            senoritas in the plaza, guarded by a fat old <hi rend="i">duenna,</hi>
                            with an eye that bores through you, and firm-set lips that bespeak a
                            temper not to be trifled with. She is called <hi rend="i">duenna</hi>
                            because she won't let the girls in her charge "duennathing" in the
                            flirtation line unless she is well paid for it. The colonel, who has
                            traveled in Spain, watches his opportunity, intercepts a glance from a
                            pair of dark eyes when the old ogre happens to be off guard, and
                            gallantly kisses his hand. The little lady looks mischievously pleased,
                            and at the next turn gives him a cautious smile over her left
                            shoulder.</p>

                            States. The people seem to be fond of sweets. The manufacture of <hi

                        <p>As business is sometimes slack, the attention of the vender is often
                            diverted from his wares for several moments.</p>
                        <p>The Mexican dog is very much like his brother in the barbaric North.</p>
                        <p>I bought no sweets in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>One day we went to visit a silk factory. We were introduced to a large
                            room where some hundred or more of brown maidens, some of them handsome
                            and all coquettish, were engaged in spooling coarse raw silk. A large
                            wooden wheel revolving at the back part of the building attracted my
                            attention. It seemed to furnish the motive power for the spindles, but I
                            was puzzled to understand what turned the wheel. No sign of an engine
                                <pb id="VAA3891-121" n="116"/> gine was visible. A clattering, as of
                            some hoofed animal climbing a stairway until he reached the top, and
                            then rolling to the bottom, added to the mystery. On approaching for a
                            nearer view the mystery was explained. The wheel was hollow, and inside
                            of it was confined a miserable mule, condemned to one eternal climb in
                            which no progress could be made. We purchased some handkerchiefs of the
                            coarse raw silk, gaudily colored, as specimens of Mexican industry.
                            Here, as everywhere else, the foreigner is expected to pay two or three
                            prices, but we found a protector in our guide. After chaffering for some
                            time over the price of a half dozen handkerchiefs, and hearing the
                            salesman's ultimatum, I was about to reach for my pocketbook. "Hold on,"
                            said Hawthorne. "Now when I tell you what he says he will take, you
                            shake your 'ead and offer him a dollar less." I shook my 'ead as
                            directed, and with a heartbroken look the abated price was accepted. I
                            have no doubt that the price I paid was still considerably more than a
                            native could have bought the same goods for.</p>
                        <p>Food is very cheap in Mexico. Likewise all articles of home manufacture,
                            and some of the imported goods. An excellent quality of brandy is
                            retailed at 121/2 cents. Whisky is only drank by Americans and
                            Englishmen. At the restaurants you get a meal for fifty cents that would
                            cost $1.50 in the States. As the servants get no pay, depending entirely
                            on what they receive from guests, it is customary to acknowledge
                            faithful and intelligent <pb id="VAA3891-122" n="117"/> service by the
                            donation of a trifle. One morning Appollonio came to me at the Comonfort
                            with a grievance. He had seen me getting my boots blacked by Bonifacio,
                            a servant on the ground floor. He wanted me to understand that all the
                            lodgers on the third floor were his peculiar meat. To appease him I got
                            him to sew a button on a refractory shirt, and paid him a quarter. The
                            prices of some articles, however, seem rather exorbitant. It stimulates
                            a fellow's appetite for ham to see a Westphalia specimen in a shop
                            window labeled six reals ($1.50) a pound. Spirits of peppermint,
                            however, seem to be the costliest article in the capital. One night Mr.
                            P. was troubled with intestine strife, probably caused by excess of
                            fruit, and thought a spoonful of that favorite domestic remedy would set
                            him right. There was a venerable old apothecary&#151;suave and
                            oily&#151;on the south side of the plaza, who had seduced us into
                            the purchase of sundry glasses of soda on pretense of speaking English.
                            Thither we repaired, and he put up an ounce of peppermint, for which he
                            unblushingly demanded a dollar. Mr. P. is not the man to be swindled
                            without kicking. If the old fraud had charged him fifty cents he would
                            have contested the claim. But the enormity of the swindle overwhelmed
                            him, and he paid it without a remonstrance. Then he walked over to the
                            plaza, took a seat under a eucalyptus tree, and <hi rend="i"
                                >pronounced.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In Mexico every business house has a fanciful name. Instead of putting
                            the name of the firm on the sign they put up its designation. For a shoe
                                <pb id="VAA3891-123" n="118"/> store the "Blue Boot" seems to be a
                            favorite name. Frequently a dry goods store is called "The Daughters of
                            Eve." "El Borrego" (the sheep) seems to be a favorite sign for a cigar
                            store. The <hi rend="i">pulque</hi> shops have the most fanciful names.
                            "The Roses of Spring," and "The Three Graces" are common names, while
                            other proprietors, with shocking candor, call their places "The Hell,"
                            "The Little Hell," "The Devil's Tail," "The Devil's School," etc.</p>
                        <p>The most beautiful suburb of Mexico is San Angel. It lies at the foot of
                            the mountains, about ten miles out, and is the wildest little beauty
                            spot I ever saw. One Sunday we took the horse cars, rode out there, and
                            spent a few hours very pleasantly in loafing about its quaint little
                            plaza, and strolling through its walled gardens, filled with apple,
                            pear, apricot and peach trees, flowers and tropical fruits. In one of
                            these gardens I saw a rose tree eight inches in diameter, and spreading
                            over a large surface of ground. It looked as if it might have been three
                            hundred years old, and I dare say it was. Around a <hi rend="i"
                                >pulque</hi> shop were gathered a dozen or more horsemen, in heavily
                            silvered sombreros, gay velvet jackets, and bell-buttoned pantaloons,
                            slashed to the knee. Horses and equipments all seemed of the finest. At
                            first I supposed they represented the dandy element of the city, out on
                            a lark, but after making merry for an hour or two, they all mounted and
                            galloped off on the road leading up the mountain. They looked like ideal
                            brigands. But as there was a garrison <pb id="VAA3891-124" n="119"/> of
                            Porfirio's soldiers within a stone's throw, we felt no
                            apprehensions.</p>
                        <p>The manifest shrinkage of our pocket-books warned us that we had better
                            get out of Mexico. The colonel had left six days ahead of us with a view
                            to visiting Puebla, and then hurrying on to Vera Cruz to catch the
                            English steamer for Havana. So, bidding a regretful adieu to our kind
                            friends, the Harrises, and others, whose acquaintance we had found very
                            pleasant, we boarded the midnight train and turned our faces seaward. We
                            were fortunate enough to secure an entire compartment of the English
                            coach to ourselves, and putting the great ulster under my head, I laid
                            down to pleasant dreams. How long I had slept I know not, but I awoke
                            with a sensation of the most stinging cold. It seemed as if an icicle
                            could not have been freer from caloric. I got into that ulster in short
                            order, tucked its long skirts about me, rolled myself into a ball, and
                            shivered until morning. Remembering the midsummer fierceness of the sun
                            at noon of the previous day, I could not have believed such a
                            temperature possible within fifty miles. But it was a frosty night. With
                            the sun came a modification of the temperature, and by ten o'clock it
                            was pleasantly warm, though Malinche was covered with snow until her
                            summit was as white as Popocatapetl. Passing Boca del Monte, and
                            hurrying down the rapid descent on the other side, the atmosphere became
                            sultry and suffocating. A hot vapor steamed up from the earth in the
                            lowlands, <pb id="VAA3891-125" n="120"/> and the rank vegetation seemed
                            loaded with pestilential miasma.</p>
                        <p>We arrived at Vera Cruz a little after dark, and were greeted with its
                            own peculiar agglomeration of stinks, each one of which seemed to have
                            grown robust and aggressive in our absence. Arriving at the hotel we
                            were overjoyed to find the colonel sitting at a little table in the
                            public room, with his feet in the sawdust and an imposing tumbler of
                            brandy and water before him. The colonel is a temperate man; with the
                            exception of a bottle of claret at dinner, he could rarely be induced to
                            imbibe. But he is an old traveler, and knows that there is no better
                            prophylactic of the poison of yellow fever than a little brandy
                            judiciously administered. He likewise knows that persistent use not only
                            deprives it of its power to protect, but betrays the improvident drinker
                            into the hands of the enemy. The colonel had stopped off a couple of
                            days to visit the cataract of Orizaba, and this is how we happened to
                            overtake him again. The next morning we put him on board the New York
                            steamer which touches at Havana, and saw him off. It seemed like parting
                            with a friend of long years' standing, instead of a chance acquaintance.
                            His last words, as our boat receded from the steamer's side, was an
                            admonition to "Beware of the hypercoon."</p>
                        <p>I had heard much in Mexico of the delicious oysters of Vera Cruz. Seeing
                            a sign in the public room of the hotel&#151;" Oysters 25 cents a
                            dozen"&#151;I concluded to try some. They brought me a plate of what
                            at first I took for empty shells, but on close <pb id="VAA3891-126"
                                n="121"/> scrutiny I detected in each shell a small, dark,
                            jelly-like substance, about the size of a nickel, which, in the absence
                            of anything better, does duty as an oyster. The shells are small and
                            thin as wafers. I tried to get at the flavor of the oysters, but could
                            not get enough of them together to make a taste. If I was real hungry I
                            would rather glean the empty shells of a dozen Barrataria oysters than
                            attempt to make a meal out of a bushel of the Vera Cruz article.</p>
                        <p>Vera Cruz, as I have said, is a lively place. As we sit in the public
                            room a drunken sailor quarrels with the barkeeper, and at every movement
                            of the latter puts his hand to his hip, where an ugly looking knife
                            reposes in a greasy sheath. He is knocked down from behind and turned
                            over to the police. An old man, bent nearly double, his thin face the
                            color of old leather, is pleading at the bar for a drink. He has a fine,
                            intellectual face, but insanity, caused by drink, has long since taken
                            possession of him. He goes about constantly talking to himself, and
                            drinking whenever he can get drink. He shows a silver piece, but the
                            attendant tells him it is not his money he wants; he has had enough
                            drink. His earnest pleading finally prevails; he swallow at a gulp the
                            tumbler of brandy, and goes out into the night. We retire early and are
                            put into a large corner room, with four windows and four beds. The heat
                            has increased until it is almost suffocating. The windows swing back on
                            hinges like doors, but only seem to admit stink, which increases rather
                            than modifies the intense <pb id="VAA3891-127" n="122"/> heat. The
                            stenches of three hundred years' accumulation seem to have all been
                            stirred up on this horrid night for our especial benefit. I take one of
                            the miserable little cots, with an insufficient mosquito bar which
                            exasperates like a short shirt. Down below they are keeping up an
                            infernal racket of card-playing and gabbling. The mosquitoes are
                            abominably active. Sleep is out of the question. P. sits in one of the
                            open windows and smokes incessantly. And so we gasp the long night away.
                            Another night of this torture and our steamer comes into port. We board
                            her immediately, and feel like new men when a mile of water intervenes
                            between our nostrils and the smells of the City of the True Cross.
                            Perhaps some may think I am prejudiced against Vera Cruz. Let them spend
                            a couple of warm nights there, and they will regret the poverty of the
                            English language. Even the buzzards have to fly a mile or so out twice a
                            day, and spend an hour or two circling over the blue water, in order to
                            escape the smells.</p>

                    <p>I <hi rend="sc">PRESUME</hi> he must have had another name, though if I ever
                        knew it, it has escaped my memory. He was known in the regiment as "Big
                        Sam." B. S. was not a graceful party, nor a pleasant fellow to look at.
                        Though prepared to polish off anybody at a moment's notice, it was quite
                        apparent that he lacked polish. He was long, loose-jointed, shambling in
                        gait, ginger-haired, lantern-jawed, and had a stoop in his shoulders. Big
                        Sam's temper was none of the sweetest, especially when he had liquor in him,
                        which was always the case, if he could get it, and he generally could. I
                        have noticed that men usually can get liquor, even when they can get nothing
                        else. A fellow may be out of credit, out at the elbows, out all over, but,
                        though he could not raise a breakfast to keep him from starving, he can
                        always manage to keep drunk. No man ever, yet kept sober for lack of money.
                        But, as I was going to remark about Big Sam, he was an ugly chap&#151;a
                        rough customer&#151;not to put too fine a point on it, a ruffian. Of his
                        career before entering <pb id="VAA3891-129" n="124"/> the service of his
                        beloved "ked'ntry" I can not speak. Somehow there was a vague impression
                        abroad that he had been a tanner, and he certainly did smell a little that
                        way, now and then.</p>
                    <p>Military discipline sat uneasily upon the shoulders of Big Sam. He could not
                        grasp the idea. Having always been accustomed to his own way, it was hard to
                        resign his individuality, and subordinate himself to the will of shoulder
                        straps. If the work of putting down the rebellion could have been effected
                        with a "hurrah"&#151;a fight in the morning and a frolic at
                        night&#151;each patriot going in voluntarily, staying as long as he
                        wanted to and using his judgment about retiring when he had enough, Big Sam
                        would have liked it. But he abominated the tomfoolery of dress parade, and
                        the absurdity of guard mounting disgusted him.</p>
                    <p>Sam was insubordinate. He was amenable to reason when sober, but he would get
                        drunk on an average twice a week, and then he was a source of vexation to
                        the officers and a bad example to the men. He would fight, break guard,
                        curse the officers and make himself disagreeable in a hundred ways. As the
                        green rabble were transformed into soldiers, and the slouching, shambling
                        gait was supplanted by the martial tread of the soldier, discipline
                        tightened on Big Sam; but he did not mind it. He could get as tight as
                        discipline could. He cared not for guard house, or any of the thousand and
                        one ingenious punishments devised to reduce his obstinate spirit, and he
                        snapped his fingers at court martial. One thing about the brute. He <pb
                            id="VAA3891-130" n="125"/> had indomitable courage. He was an exception
                        to the rule that a bully is always a coward. I have seen him heap the
                        foulest epithets on an officer with a cocked revolver in one hand and a
                        watch in the other, waiting for the allotted five minutes to expire before
                        being shot for gross insubordination. By every vile abuse his ingenuity
                        could devise, Big Sam invited death, but the natural repugnance which every
                        one feels to shedding the blood of an unarmed man prevailed over a sense of
                        duty, and Big Sam was spared, "to the prejudice of good order and military
                        discipline." Matters finally became critical with the regimental elephant.
                        It was quite apparent that something must be done with him. If he had taken
                        it into his jackass head to desert it would have relieved the colonel of a
                        load of responsibility. No reward would have been offered for him, and no
                        attempt would have been made to hunt him up or down. The colonel pondered
                        over him. Several courses of treatment suggested themselves. He might be
                        shot almost any day in the week with good effect on the regimental <hi
                            rend="i">morale,</hi> or he might be drummed out with a full regimental
                        band playing the Rogue's March; but the colonel was loth to accept either of
                        these alternatives. So he tried an experiment. He made him a corporal. Big
                        Sam went into the colonel's tent wearing his usual sullen look, and came out
                        bewildered and foolish. He could not understand it. He pondered the matter,
                        and the more he turned it over, the more inextricably confused he became.
                        However, from that moment <pb id="VAA3891-131" n="126"/> there was a change,
                        or rather a succession of changes, in Big Sam.</p>
                    <p>The first change was that of his shirt, and as he appeared at guard-mounting
                        with his face washed, his coat brushed, and the new chevrons on his sleeves,
                        he appeared quite a different man. His opinions on various mooted military
                        points underwent a radical change. The adjutant's way of putting
                        it&#151;"You have no right to think, sir. The Government pays men to
                        think for you!"&#151;no longer struck him as being a monstrous
                        infringement of individual rights. Circumstances alter cases, and from his
                        corporal standpoint, the old East Indian's rude enunciation of a great
                        military idea no longer appeared so monstrously arbitrary. Big Sam felt that
                        he now was paid by the Government to think for others. Unlike many, Big Sam
                        did not become a tyrant as soon as he was promoted. The dignity of the
                        position was duly appreciated, but he was not inflated by its importance. He
                        was as stern a corporal in all matters of duty as ever posted a sentinel,
                        but he was impartial and just in the exercise of his authority. From the
                        worst man and the most insubordinate soldier in the regiment he became
                        orderly, well-behaved and trustworthy. His drunks became few and far
                        between, and even in his cups he never forgot that he was an officer in the
                        service of the republic, and that his name was at stake.</p>
                    <p>Big Sam died ingloriously. It was all about a little matter of honey. He had
                        discovered a beehive near the camp, and had told a comrade of it <pb
                            id="VAA3891-132" n="127"/> in confidence. One day when far gone under
                        the influence of his ancient enemy, he concluded he would go out and harvest
                        his honey. Unluckily he encountered his perfidious comrade, apparently bent
                        on the same errand, on the ground. The sergeant was quite as drunk as the
                        big corporal. There were hot words, and mutual recriminations. The sergeant,
                        a small, slightly built man, wanted to fight, but Big Sam scorned to fight
                        so small a man. He proposed ten paces, and a settlement with revolvers, and
                        his proposition was accepted. The ground was stepped, the word given, and
                        the pistols cracked simultaneously. A navy ball passed through the
                        sergeant's hair, and Big Sam lay stretched upon the grass, spitting blood.
                        The bullet had passed through his lungs. He was on his feet in a moment, and
                        "reckoned" it didn't amount to much. The sergeant, pale as a sheet and
                        sobered by the termination of the affair, was at his side in a moment,
                        anxiously inquiring where he was hit, and the night-capped head of the
                        rightful owner of the honey, who had been a horror-stricken witness of the
                        affair, was hastily withdrawn from the upper window out of which it had been
                        protruded.</p>
                    <p>"Sergeant, you'll have to help me to camp," said Big Sam. "I feel kind o'
                        squeamish like, and I'm afraid you've cooked my goose for me. We're a couple
                        o' d&#151;d fools anyhow. But I'm d&#151;d glad I didn't hit
                        you."</p>
                    <p>Big Sam lay on his cot in the hospital, which was located on an old wharf
                        boat. It was on the <pb id="VAA3891-133" n="128"/> night of the tenth day
                        since the moonlight duel over the beehive. He had steadily and obstinately
                        refused at first to tell how he had received his wound, but the sergeant, a
                        prey to unavailing regrets, had told the whole story, and the owner of the
                        honey had corroborated it. Big Sam's iron constitution had held out
                        manfully, and hopes of his recovery were entertained. A paymaster was in
                        camp, and the rolls had been brought down for Big Sam to sign. Partially
                        raising himself on one elbow, he grasped the pen, wrote his name in great
                        sprawling letters, and fell back exhausted. Then he slept, for a short time,
                        awaking with a start. "Lieutenant," he called, with something of alarm in
                        his voice, "Come to me. D&#151;d if I aint dying!, Yes I am! I feel it.
                        I'll be dead in ten minutes. Lieutenant, I've been a hard case. I never had
                        no raisin', and growed up among thieves and drunkards, but by G&#151;d
                        I've tried to make a man of myself an' do my duty by the boys. Tell Jake not
                        to fret about it. I was more to blame than him. You draw my money to-morrow
                        and send it to&#151;. Pay Stigall a dollar out of it. What the
                        h&#151;ll did you put the light out for? No? Good God! I'm blind! Good
                        bye, Lieutenant! I'm going. Christ have mercy on me."</p>
                    <p>His eyes closed, and his breathing was that of a dying man. After a few
                        moments of silence, broken only by the labored respiration, he muttered in
                        broken tones, "Fool! All for&#151;a little&#151;stolen honey!" And
                        then Big Sam turned half <pb id="VAA3891-134" n="129"/> way over, a
                        convulsive shiver ran through his giant frame, his legs stiffened out, and
                        he was dead.</p>
                    <p>I have given the death-bed scene of Big Sam as I remember it, in all its
                        horrible profanity, without apology. The Sergeant was court-martialed, but
                        nothing was done with him. The death of Big Sam, however, has always lain
                        heavily on his conscience. Since that awful night he has eaten no honey nor
                        drank any liquor.</p>

                    <p>W<hi rend="sc">E</hi> could not be mistaken. We knew him by his long,
                        loose-jointed legs, his shambling gait, and the peculiar manner in which he
                        slung his ape-like arms about him. His face was scored like pork, and
                        patched up with bits of sticking plaster. One ear had been "chawed off," and
                        both eyes were terribly bunged. Some accomplished artist had evidently
                        undertaken the job of polishing him off. When we say <hi rend="i">him,</hi>
                        we wish to be understood as alluding to our osseous friend, Mr. James Bales,
                        Esq., a long, lean, gaunt and hungry patriot who lives over the river, and
                        earns his bread by fishing and hunting, with brief variations in the way of
                        manual labor. Jim isn't on good terms with our Spanish friend, Manual, and
                        generally picks a quarrel with him the first week, relapsing into
                        vagabondism. His standard amusements are tobacco chewing, whisky drinking,
                        fiddling and fighting. He has abundance of pluck and a fair knowledge of the
                        manly art; and hence&#151;a felicitous expression, for which we
                        acknowledge our indebtedness to a well-known educator&#151; <pb
                            id="VAA3891-136" n="131"/> we were somewhat surprised to see him so
                        badly used up.</p>
                    <p>"Hullo! Jim! been fightin'?"</p>
                    <p>The long, shambling legs came to a dead halt, the windmill arms ceased to
                        vibrate, and he regarded us with a half-puzzled, half-defiant glare.</p>
                    <p>"W'y George, I didn't see yer. Ha'nt seen much o' anything for the last ten
                        days. Look at them eyes, George. D'ye think ye could git along with sech a

                    <p>He twisted off about two ounces of cavendish and thrust it into his cavernous
                        jaws.</p>
                    <p>"Well, George, that's about the meanest terbacker I ever knowed a white man
                        to carry. Not white enough to spile the hide, though, are ye, George? Haw!

                    <p>"Yes, I'm a comin' to that. But, George, I'm dry as a lime-kiln. Got any

                        but it won't go down wi' me. You see I know ye&#151;know'd ye in the

                    <p>The amount of fluid with which Mr. Bales proposed to "lubricate" was
                        certainly the most astonishing "forty drops" that ever came within the
                        observation of that barkeeper. He stared in openmouthed wonder, and muttered
                        some incoherent nonsense about doing a wholesale business.</p>
                    <p>Having enveloped his benzine, which he did at a single gulp, finishing the
                        performance with a relishing smack of the lips, we pressed Jim for the story
                        of his fight.</p>
                    <p>"Well, you see," began Mr. Bales, first polishing his worst eye with the
                        remains of a red silk handkerchief, "I had bin workin' purty steady at the
                        pork'us, and had got sort o' tired o' spar ribs, an' sich. They kind o'
                        turned agin me, you know, an' I hankered arter wild game&#151;a briled
                        squirrel, or a couple o' nice patridges. So I thought I'd jest take my gun
                        an' try the fields a round. Lize said I had better a durned sight go to work
                        an' git money enough to buy myself a pair o' boots. I had a sort o' sneakin'
                        notion that Lize's head was level; but you know, George, these women han't
                        much idee o' field sports, anyhow, an' as I'd bin a workin' purty study for
                        more'n a week, I thought I'd go jest once, an' trust to luck fur the boots.
                        So givin' Jule, the bitch, a perliminnerry thrashin', to subdue the
                        exuberance of her animal sperits, I started out. Lize was mad as a hornet,
                        an' her little black eyes was a snappin' like coals o' fire. I know'd I
                        wasn't doin' the <pb id="VAA3891-138" n="133"/> clean thing by Lize, who is
                        a good woman, George, only she has the allfiredest temper in the world; but
                        I was mighty tired o' work, an' needed a little recreation. Well, as I was
                        sayin', we started out, an' beat over a dozen fields without raisin'
                        anything bigger'n a grasshopper. Jule worked mighty industrious, (she was
                        afraid of another lickin') but there wasn't a feather in a rajus o' ten
                        mild. The infernal town hunters had skeered the blasted birds clean outen
                        the county. A big disgust come over me, an' I started fur Stringtown. I
                        gravitated into a pizen shop, and thar I found a feller with a fiddle. You
                        know my weakness, George. I kin no more git away from a fiddle, speshally ef
                        there's any rum about, than a hoss kin git away from a burnin' stable.
                        Consequence was that midnight found me a fiddlin' an' dancin', drunker nor a
                        biled owl. I'll never tell ye how I gut home, but when I did sneak in I
                        found Lize ready fur me, bilin' over with madness, cocked an' primed with a
                        big, curting lecture. I've had many a curting lecture, George, but blamed ef
                        that wasn't the completest one I ever heerd tell on. Lize astonished me, an'
                        I da' say she astonished herself. I didn't think it was in her. There's
                        nothin' equal to a woman's tongue when it gits a goin' rightly, an' ef that
                        blessed female didn't keep it up, without intermission for refreshments, the
                        livelong night, then may I never taste sperits agin. She jawed and jawed
                        till I thought the hinges would a wore out, an' the more I said nothin' the
                        harder she jawed. Ef I pertended <pb id="VAA3891-139" n="134"/> to snore
                        she'd punch me in the ribs. I thought of a tough ramrod I had in the corner,
                        an was orfully tempted to try it on her; but that would a' been too durned
                        mean. Or'nary an triflin' as I am I never yet licked a woman, George, but a
                        feller that drinks Stringtown whisky is never safe, even from that. But I
                        banished the ramrod from my mind, an' told Satan to git him behind me, an'
                        he got. Finally, about daylight, Lize got kind o' hystericky, an' I dropped
                        into a oneasy sleep, durin' which I could hear Lize's tongue still a goin'
                        it, an' sech words as `brute,' `beast,' an' `hog,' comin' an allfired sight
                        thicker an' faster than bullets did in the whisky charge at Port Hudson.
                        That died out in time, an' I slept like a log. Ever drink any Stringtown
                        whisky, George? No? Well, then, there's a new sensation a waitin' for
                        you."</p>
                    <p>At this point Mr. Bales' throat became husky, and the barkeeper was again
                        astonished to the extent of forty drops, after which the historian
                        proceeded:</p>
                    <p>"I don't think I had slept more'n fifteen minutes when I was waked up by the
                        orfullest howl you ever heerd. I riz up sort o' galvanic like, jest in time
                        to see the bitch a scootin' out o' the door in a mist o' steam, and Lize
                        standin' in the middle o' the floor, with the tea-kettle in her hand. You
                        orter see that animile's back, George; not a sign o' har from the shoulders
                        to the tail, no more'n there is in the palm o' my hand. At first I thought
                        it was a accident, but when I seed Lize (durn 'er) <pb id="VAA3891-140"
                            n="135"/> reach for my fiddle, I know'd she done it a purpose. Blamed ef
                        she didn't smash it into a thousand pieces. Then she made a dive for my
                        gun&#151;the one I won at a raffle, George. I jumped out, but a leetle
                        too late&#151;jest in time to ketch her after she'd broke it off at
                        britch. I thought of the ramrod agin, but blamed ef she didn't soon take
                        that outen me. She made a swipe at me with the gun barrels, an' I swindled
                        ole Allred outen a job by a clever dodge. Things was a gettin' serous, an' I
                        lit out. It was a right sharp mornin', an' my costume was rather airy for
                        the season; so, arter hangin' around the chimley for ten minutes, and
                        shiverin' until my teeth chattered like a skeered monkey, I concluded I
                        would look in. Lize was a settin' in the corner, with her face to the wall.
                        I snoke in, got into my duds in somethin' of a hurry, bid Mrs. Bales an
                        affectionate good mornin', and left fur the river. You're right agin, old
                        hoss! I wasn't in the sweetest humor. There was a swarm o' bees buzzin' in
                        my head, which seemed 'bout the size of a kit of No. I mackerel, an' I felt
                        savage as a wild Injun. Well, I got down to the pork'us, an' was standin'
                        around, waitin', when along come a big red-headed lummux, who makes his
                        wharabouts in the Broad Riffle settlement. He wer a haulin' hogs, and had
                        with him one of the sneakinest brindle dogs that you ever see&#151;jest
                        the kind o' dog as any jury of his countrymen would convict of sheep-killin'
                        and aig-suckin' on a shadder o' suckemstanshul evidence. I'd seen the ornery
                        cuss and his dog many a time before hangin' around the <pb id="VAA3891-141"
                            n="136"/> Stringtown groceries, and durned ef I liked either of'em; but
                        I kept my fly-trap shet, 'cause you see, Georgey, he was mighty wide out
                        between the shoulders, an' I wasn't altogether clear in my own mind that he
                        wouldn't git away with me. This mornin', howsever, I was so mad I could a'
                        fit Mc-Coole hisself, an' when the blasted cur come a smellin' around me, to
                        see whether I was one o' his sort, I s'pose, I jest handed him a kick under
                        the ear, which landed him all of a heap in the fence corner, a howlin' until
                        you might a' heerd him at the lunatic asylum. In a minute Red Head was off
                        his wagon and a comin' at me, lookin' mighty vicious. Says'e, "Jim Bales,
                        what did you kick my dog fur? I'd ruther you'd kick me than to have you kick
                        Scrunch." I knew there was goin' to be a fight, an' it was jest in my line.
                        `Well,' said I, `I'd jest as leave kick you as yer blasted, suck-aig hound.
                        Wot are you goin' to do about it?' I knew it was a comin', but it come a
                        little sooner than I expected. There was something like the bustin' of a ten
                        inch shell atwixt the eyes, an' I see a million o' stars. I think I turned
                        as purty a summerset as ever you see outside the circus. I got up an' went
                        at him again, when I caught a reglar rib-roaster. I could feel 'em crack
                        jest z'if you'd hit 'em with a maul. 'Taint wuth while to give each round
                        separate, George. For the fust ten minutes I got the wust of it, and was
                        beginnin' to feel sorry I had undertaken the job, when I found his wind was
                        a failin' him. That's where old Bales gits 'em all George. He outwinds 'em.
                        The tide had <pb id="VAA3891-142" n="137"/> turned, and he was flat of his
                        back, and the subscriber was gittin' his money back with neatness and
                        dispatch. He was jest gittin' ready to blate when the blasted dog come up
                        and bit me&#151;,"</p>
                    <p>"Where?" we inquired,</p>
                    <p>"None 'o your durned business," said Jim, with more heat than the nature of
                        the question called for; "but it was an orful bite, and I hain't sot down
                        with no sort 'o satisfaction sence. But as I was a sayin' when you put in
                        with your fool question&#151;durn a fool, anyhow&#151;when the dog
                        bit me I gin' a most onearthly yell, an' jumped up to fight the enemy in the
                        rear. The other feller took a fresh start while I was lookin' arter the dog,
                        and he gimme a sockdologer under the ear which sent me to grass. He wasn't
                        long a gittin' astraddle of me, and the way he put in the licks was truly
                        astonishin'. I've had more'n a hundred fights, George, but he's the nastiest
                        customer I ever run afoul of. It was wuss than your fight with the Grand
                        Army. Let's liquor."</p>
                    <p>"But how did it end, Jim?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, you see, he's a heftier man than me, anyhow, an' it was nip an' tuck,

                    <p>"But which licked?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, George, it wer hardly a far fight. You see I'd had no breakfast, and
                        the infernal String-town whisky&#151;"</p>
                    <p>"Yes. But the result. How did you come out?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, you see, ef it hadn't a' been for the dog&#151;"</p>

                    <p>"Oh, blow the dog! Did you clean him out?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, ef you must know, I HOLLERED, durn ye, an' I reckon you'd a hollered
                        too, ef you'd a had Goliar astraddle of ye, shettin' off yer wind with one
                        hand while he gouged the eyes outen ye with the other. I'm done fightin' an'
                        fiddlin' George, and am goin' to work ef I kin find somethin' light and
                        genteel. I'd ruther tend bar, but ef you see H. tell him I'd take a sit to

                    <p>We had got to the corner when Mr. Bales called us back.</p>

                    <head>MAN,<lb/> CONSIDERED AS A CANDLE.</head>
                    <p>W<hi rend="sc">HAT</hi> is man? The old conundrum which has never been
                        satisfactorily answered. A limited acquaintance with anatomical and
                        physiological science teaches us that man is made of blood, bones, muscle,
                        cartilages, integuments, intestines, hair, horns, sheep's wool, leather,
                        stove-pipe hats, and other miscellaneous ingredients; but these, though
                        essential, are not all of man. Plato's definition&#151;a two-legged
                        animal without feathers&#151;was good enough, until a captious student
                        plucked a Cochin China cock, and held up the denuded fowl before the puzzled
                        philosopher with the admonition, "Behold your man!" "The animal that
                        laughs," provided a ready solution to the problem, until it was discovered
                        that the hyena also laughs. Job probably came as near meeting the question
                        as any one else has ever done, when he said, "Man that is born of a woman is
                        of few days, and full of trouble." Still the answer is a little lame in some
                        particulars, which it would be <pb id="VAA3891-145" n="140"/> neither
                        pleasant nor profitable to consider just at present. Suppose, for instance,
                        we consider man in the light of a candle, not by candle-light. It will not
                        do to trace these resemblances too closely, of course, and due license must
                        be accorded, with the usual privilege of ignoring such facts as do not suit
                        us, gently distorting where it is necessary, and dwelling strongly on the
                        available features of the case.</p>
                    <p>Man's life is, in many respects, like the burning of a candle. If the candle
                        is properly made, and the burning is not interrupted by swaying to and fro,
                        or by gusts of wind, the combustion goes steadily on, emitting an even
                        light; but at the expense of the material. The end comes in due time, and
                        the candle is burnt out. There is a flickering in the socket, a convulsive
                        leaping up of the flame, and the candle goes out in utter darkness. "Out
                        brief candle," is the manner in which Shakespeare puts it. The candle of
                        man's existence, to run its natural course, will finally expire in darkness.
                        But this event may be hastened by extraneous influences. As a puff of wind
                        will extinguish the tallow dip, a trifling interference with the natural
                        course of combustion&#151;a tap on the head with a bludgeon, a mince pie
                        or a lobster salad late at night, the breathing of a sufficient amount of
                        slaughter-house effluvia, to inaugurate typhoid fever&#151;a fall from a
                        horse, a cramp in the water, or any one of a thousand trifling
                        incidents&#151;may extinguish the flame of a human candle. This thing we
                        call life is held, or <pb id="VAA3891-146" n="141"/> holds itself, by a
                        frail and uncertain tenure which, as Carlyle remarks, the splutter of a
                        pistol-shot, or the prick of a bare bodkin will destroy. Hence, the slang
                        phrase for killing a man comes by the easy analogy of reasoning to be known
                        as "snuffing out his light."</p>
                    <p>Different men burn differently. Here is one whose life is a steady, even
                        flame, emitting a clear light, and when rudely jostled only spilling a
                        trifle of grease, and again resuming the even tenor of his combustion. This
                        is the human stearine. And again, we have the autocratic wax taper, emitting
                        a perfumed light, but expiring when the end comes with as hopeless a flutter
                        as that which characterizes the vulgar dip. The tallow candle, which
                        requires frequent trimming, guttering and wasting its substance without
                        affording much light, and burning with a nauseous smell, is typical of the
                        lives of some men. And there are others who remind us of that fire-work
                        known as the Roman candle, by the fizzing rapidity of their consumption,
                        relieved by periodical explosions, projecting meteor-like balls of fire into
                        surrounding space.</p>
                    <p>The flame of the candle suggests the intelligence, vital principle and soul
                        of man. A puff of breath, or a nip with the snuffers, and the flame is gone.
                        The candle may be relighted, but it is not the same flame which was
                        extinguished. <hi rend="i">That</hi> is gone beyond reach. It is out of
                        existence. The elements that constituted it are still in existence, and a
                        new flame may be raised, but it is not the flame which we saw extinguished,
                        snuffed out a <pb id="VAA3891-147" n="142"/> moment since. It is but a
                        little thing to puzzle one's brain about, and yet it is enough to start the
                        most painful train of thoughts. What if man's life once extinguished is like
                        the snuffed-out flame of the candle? What if the impalpable atoms which
                        constitute the soul should follow the laws of inanimate matter, and
                        eternally perish and be eternally reproduced, but never in the same
                        combinations? We understand that nothing material perishes or is created.
                        There is constant change, but no new creation of the elements which in
                        certain combinations make up the flesh, hair, fingernails, blood and bones
                        of an earthly tabernacle. Men die and worms do eat them. The soil absorbs
                        them, and gives them out again in new combinations; but never again in the
                        endless cycles of time can the man who has once lived and died be reproduced
                        by an accidental reunion of the identical atoms of which he was composed, or
                        if he is, he will never know it, which amounts to the same thing. The
                        fearful thought obtrudes itself that possibly the same laws may govern the
                        life and death of the soul&#151;that when snuffed out like the flame of
                        the candle, its identity is eternally lost; that the atoms of intelligence
                        constituting the soul may enter into other souls; but never by any
                        possibility can they be re-united in the same proportions. It is a sad
                        muddle at best, and nothing can be gained by vain endeavors to unravel the
                        hopeless tangle. The instincts of human nature revolt at the horrible
                        thought of annihilation, and even the lowest races of men entertain crude
                        ideas of life <pb id="VAA3891-148" n="143"/> beyond the grave. It is better
                        to accept this hope of immortality as a matter of course than become a prey
                        to self-tormenting doubts, and become insane in the hopeless efforts to
                        comprehend the in-comprehensible. But if man dying shall live again, what of
                        the beasts? Is there any difference in the phenomena which attend the birth,
                        life and death of a dog and those which mark the exit and entrance of man?
                        Do they not each gasp the same, and are not the writhings and convulsions of
                        the supreme moment the same, to all human appearances, in either case? The
                        dog has a certain amount of intelligence in life. It is less than that of a
                        complete man and greater than that of an idiotic man. But this is getting
                        near to dangerous ground again&#151;ground which has quaked and yawned
                        beneath the tread of others; in whose fateful furrows stand the dread
                        danger-posts warning the fool-hardy from nearer approach. "Man dieth and
                        wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?" Ay, where is
                        he?</p>

                            >Arachnida,</hi> the spider under consideration is the most interesting,
                        while its habits are least understood. The female spider spins, but it is
                        not every <hi rend="i">spinster</hi> who is a spider. Indeed, the sex
                        generally are the flies that tangle themselves in webs of others' weaving,
                        and are devoured&#151;while the female spider is an anomaly&#151;the
                        avenging Nemesis of her sex&#151;spinning and weaving meshes for the
                        ensnarement of the common enemy. She is an innocent looking creature, and
                        the threads with which she binds her victims are of the finest gossamer,
                        though they have the strength of bars of steel. The more we study the habits
                        of this creature, the more we are lost in amazement. We can trace her origin
                        to no distinct source, and she is not amenable to the laws of production. At
                        some time in her life she has probably been a fly herself, and struggled to
                        shake of the thraldom of some disgusting male spider's web, only succeeded
                        by doffing the characteristics of the fly species, and becoming a spider.
                        And in support of this theory we quote Holy Writ, for is it not <pb
                            id="VAA3891-150" n="145"/> written, that they shall hatch cockatrice's
                        eggs, and whatever is crushed turneth to a spider?</p>
                    <p>There is one peculiarity about the female spider's mode of capturing her prey
                        which is worthy of special mention. Ordinarily the entanglement of a fly in
                        the web is the work of accident or fate. Gaily buzzing around, careless of
                        anything, save the pursuit of pleasure, and with a blind confidence in her
                        supposed ability to take, care of herself, the fly dashes into the web
                        artfully spread in some favorite haunt, and in a moment her wings are bound.
                        She may buzz piteously and struggle desperately, but to no avail. She is
                        devoured by the hairy, hideous monster, or only escapes terribly lacerated,
                        unable to compete with her more fortunate fellow flies in the mad whirl, and
                        an object of pity, if not of contempt.</p>
                    <p>The female spider's web, however, is plainly visible, and the victim buzzes
                        into it with his eyes open. But he labors under a singular delusion. Judging
                        only from outside appearances, he makes the fatal mistake of believing this
                        spider to be no more than a common fly, all the time fancying <hi rend="i"
                            >he</hi> is the spider that is going to devour her. The meshes are woven
                        around him, and still he fails to comprehend the situation. He whets his
                        appetite by gloating over this spider so like a fly in her make-up, as to
                        deceive the very elect of spiders, and more hopelessly entangles himself in
                        the effort to approach nearer. Finally, the critical moment draws near, and
                        with an appetite sharpened by pursuit, he attempts a dinner. He makes a
                        discovery <pb id="VAA3891-151" n="146"/> which leaves him utterly
                        bewildered. The fly is not a fly after all, but a spider, infinitely more
                        subtle than <hi rend="i">his</hi> kind. After a desperate struggle he
                        accepts the situation, and becomes a helpless fly, still retaining all the
                        savage instincts of the spider. He suffers the horrors of Tantalus, "in
                        sight of heaven, enduring hell." Dead Sea fruit is his only diet. His spider
                        instincts rage within him, and his fangs' whet themselves in impotent rage.
                        This is the female spider's diet. She does not devour him bodily, after the
                        manner of ordinary spiders, but she feeds on his sighs and groans, and his
                        complaining buzzings are music to her ears. He becomes enamored of the
                        thousand delicate little filaments which bind him; but at times there comes
                        a revulsion, and he makes a fierce struggle for freedom. With a syren song,
                        she again rouses his spider instincts to the pursuit, and weaves a stronger
                        web about him.</p>
                    <p>She welcomes to her net those foolish, noisy flies. Here is a great
                        blundering booby of a blue-bottle; with a pompous strut and a sonorous song,
                        he dashes in the midst of the silken threads, and, like an insect Samson, is
                        straightway taken in the toils. There is something ludicrous in the
                        consternation with which he meets his defeat, and something contemptible in
                        the craven submission with which he suffers himself to be bound, wing and
                        foot, without another effort to accomplish his original, purpose. And then
                        comes the rapacious dragon fly, with a noise like the blare of a trumpet. It
                        takes longer to settle him, and he is ever <pb id="VAA3891-152" n="147"/>
                        restive in the meshes. And then there is the gadfly, and the horsefly, and
                        the shoo-fly, all finding comfortable entanglement in the web, with an
                        occasional mosquito, and now and then a gaudy butterfly, odorous with balm
                        of a thousand flowers. It is curious as well as instructive to watch the
                        vin-dictiveness with which the spoiler grabs her prey. There is no "will you
                        walk into my parlor air" about her now; no shy, timid glances as when she
                        lurked in the far corner of her silken den, waiting, watching for the poor,
                        foolish one now writhing beneath her sharp stiletto. All pretense of virtue
                        has vanished. She is only a wrathful, greedy spider, feeding on her helpless
                        victim in gloating silence and with hideous mien. Soon she will have rent
                        those gauzy wings that so lately floated on the ambient air, or have borne
                        away the delicate remains of the feast to her secret larder; then, with
                        swift and silent shuttle, she will repair the meshes now torn or tangled by
                        the late struggle, and set her wiles again.</p>

                    </epigraph>
                    <p>A noble life, full of promise, has gone out in shame. She loved much and she
                        suffered much. Her sorrowful soul, released from earth-burdens, has gone to
                        meet its God, to lay before Him the cruel wrongs for which earth has no
                        redress. Poor, fond heart! ill-starred from birth, your tempestuous beatings
                        are stilled, your restless longings will trouble no more! Her's was a
                        joyless childhood, warped and distorted by relentless circumstances. Her
                        womanhood is blasted in the bud. Despite unfortunate traits and unhappy
                        moods, in which she seemed to move and act as if under some wierd spell, her
                        underlying nature was noble, generous, unselfish, self-sacrificing, with an
                        honest pride which would scorn to do a mean action. The unhappy
                        circumstances attending her childhood had impressed her nature with an
                        ineffaceable tinge of melancholy. She was despondent always, rather than
                        sanguine. "Papa," she said to me once, when a cherished desire was thwarted,
                        and I was endeavoring to console her; <pb id="VAA3891-154" n="149"/> "don't
                        distress yourself about me. My entire life has been a disappointment."
                        Notwithstanding the sombre tints in her nature, she was at times almost
                        unnaturally vivacious. But even in her most cheery moments an apparent
                        consciousness of the falseness and hollowness of earthly things could be
                        noted. Her deepest and profoundest feeling, the one which was ever present
                        and was never overshadowed by doubts, or obscured by less worthy sentiments,
                        was love for her unhappy father. This love had taken root in her infantile
                        mind, at an age when impressions are easily effaced, but it grew without
                        nurture, and seemed to strike deeper its roots, and grow more luxuriant in
                        leaf and bloom, the more it was deprived of light and air. It survived
                        absence, apparent neglect, hostile influences; and so soon as she was of age
                        she came to the father whose love she had never doubted.</p>
                    <p>In her religious nature she was peculiar. She had the profoundest veneration
                        for Deity, and a sublime confidence in his justness, but she had no sympathy
                        with creeds, or the forms of religion. She believed in the law of
                        compensation, and having known but little save unhappiness, she believed
                        that the future, either on earth or in Heaven, had recompense in store for
                        her. She often jested on the subject of suicide, and on one occasion being
                        reproved, and told that God frowned upon self-murder, she said, "Papa, I am
                        not afraid of God."</p>
                    <p>There are fewer brighter intellects than Flora's, <pb id="VAA3891-155"
                            n="150"/> and her future was full of promise. She had a remarkably
                        felicitous command of language, and was exceedingly versatile. While she
                        knew nothing of politics, her familiarity with recondite subjects was
                        wonderful. In reasoning she was subtle and in thought she was powerful and
                        searching. She had determined on literature as a profession, and had she
                        lived, would have made her mark in the world of letters.</p>
                    <p>The cruelest reflection in this hour of bitterest agony is that her father
                        might have been less stern and more sympathetic in his intercourse with her,
                        though he could not have loved her more. With two such natures an
                        estrangement is apt to raise up an invisible but impassable barrier, and
                        while there may be no spoken word of unkindness, the reserve is infinitely
                        more cruel and cutting than words could be. The unhappy secret&#151;the
                        first withholding of confidence&#151;caused such a feeling, and this was
                        only broken down the night before her death, when, on her father's breast,
                        with her arms about his neck, in heart-broken sobs she told him the dreadful
                        story, and pleaded for his forgiveness, not so much for her sin as for the
                        want of confidence in him. All was forgiven, and father and daughter once
                        more reconciled. Even then she had determined on suicide, and that last,
                        heart-breaking interview, so sweet to remember and yet so sad, must be
                        invested with all the sanctity of a death-bed revelation.</p>
                    <p>Through that long last day of suffering I watched with her, alternately
                        cheered by hope and torn with <pb id="VAA3891-156" n="151"/> the anguish of
                        despair, and with the last gasp, as the suffering soul took its tremulous
                        flight, two great tears came from the filmy eyes and rolled over the face,
                        across which was stealing the shadow of the Death Angel. She has gone to her
                        God, who will judge her not by the iron rule which brings all natures to a
                        common measurement, but according to her deserts. God could not be God
                        without being just, and with him I leave my daughter. But it does seem as if
                        he should have some thunderbolt, red with uncommon wrath, to strike the
                        wretch who pursues his victim, with foul and venomous tongue, into the grave
                        itself.</p>

                        Betse an' Lize 'ud make it extremely on-healthy for me jest now. What's the

                        continued.</p>
                    <p>"Did I tell you 'bout Betse an' Lize gettin' fashionable? Yes? Well, you see,
                        it has allus gone agin the grain with me, this tomfoolery o' hair an' hoops,
                        an' bustles, but el you know anything about women, George, an' I reckon you
                        do, you know a man might jest as well give in fust as last, fur they will
                        have their own way, durn 'em. An' by the way, did it ever strike you that
                        they're gittin' to be bigger fools every year? It ain't only the grown up
                        women as makes skeerkrows of themselves, but the little gals, who should be
                        makin' dirt pies, or ridin' a see-saw a-straddle, has got at it, an' are
                        jest as big fools as their sisters. Every brat ten years old must have her
                        shinnion, an' her high-heeled shoes, an' her flubdubberies. And what's wuss,
                        the old uns encourages 'em in it. Every little chit must carry herself like
                        a lady, as they call it, an' they even go so fur as to counterfeit natur',
                        to make 'em appear older'n they are. D'ye notice, George, what a percocious
                        d'velopment there is 'bout the bosom o' these little critters? Cotton? Of
                        course it's cotton, or rags, or bran, or somethin' of the kind. We all know
                        it ain't natur', for natur never makes any show o' that kind until there's
                        some use for it, and in this here temprit zone the sex is hardly calc'lated
                        for the juties o' maternity at the age o' ten years. But w'at's the use o'
                        this sham? Now, w'en a full grown woman finds herself lackin' in this matter
                        o' shape, I can't say as I kin blame her for flyin' to curled hair, Spanish
                            <pb id="VAA3891-159" n="154"/> moss, or cotton. There is some excuse fur
                        her. Leastways there's a motive in it.</p>
                    <p>"I tell you, George, the female portion o' the great North American race
                        ripens soon enough fur any use, an' it don't need any hot-house fur 'em.
                        About Betse? Well, I'm comin' to that. You see Lize has been going to
                        school, an' soshiatin' with grown-up gals until her durned tow-head is full
                        o' fashion an' fellers, an' gittin' married. But that's not the worst of it.
                        George, would you b'leeve it? Betse has got it worse than Lize. She's got to
                        runnin' with that old catamaran, Mrs. Flounce, the milliner, an' she's been
                        adding to her fooleries, little by little, until she comes out in what she
                        calls full dress. She's a regular show. She keeps the house stunk up with
                        all sorts o' perfumes, an' puts powder an' some sort o' chalky stuff they
                        call "Sweet Sixteen" on her face. An' then she concluded she must give a
                        party to a lot o' old hens and their broods which she has got acquainted
                        with in the neighborhood. She kept it devilish sly from me, only I saw there
                        was a heap o' fixin' up an' bakin' goin' on. Last Tuesday night I went home
                        an' found Lize in an awful splutter. She hed on a new white dress made with
                        low neck an' short sleeves, an' on the table was lyin' one o' them monstrous
                        hair fixins which they call Shetlin braids. You know what I mean,
                        George&#151;one o' them things made o' rolls o' dead people's hair over
                        a frame-work of somethin' cheaper, an' three tails o' curled hair a-hangin'
                        alone. It was a trifle less'n a hay-cock in size, but it made an awful <pb
                            id="VAA3891-160" n="155"/> pile. An' then Lize told me about the party,
                        an' you kin bet your bottom entrail I was hoppin' mad. I d&#151;d around
                        right lively for a while, but Lize took it cool, an' told me to keep my
                        shirt on. An' then I said, sort o' sourkastic like, says I:</p>
                    <p>"Lize, you'd better keep your own shirt on. Leastways you'd better put on one
                        that's a little longer at the top."</p>
                    <p>You see Lize ain't no use fur any o' that cotton or curled hair we was
                        talkin' about, and she's fool enough to be proud o' her white skin. When I
                        told her that she didn't blush a durned bit. She only laughed, an' told me
                        to "Honey swot kee Molly Pouse!" Now what'n hell d'ye s'pose the wench meant
                        by that lingo, George? I don't know Molly Pouse, an' what's she got to do
                        with it, any-how? Reckon she's one o' them whisk-y, frisky, teeterin',
                        gigglin' heifers at the seminary where Lize is gettin' polished. But I ain't
                        a-goin' to be "honey swotted" at by any one o' my own kids. I tell you I was
                        madder'n a bull fur a little while, an' I got out a green cowhide which I
                        keep to lick the dogs with, an' I had a devil uv a notion to give Lize about
                        twenty-five, and Betse a hundred, but I thought better of it. You see,
                        George, I've allus been a drunken, hell-raisin', trifling, or'nary cuss; but
                        I never yit lifted a hand agin the wife of my bosom, an' never felt like it
                        till she got to be seen a durned fool. I b'leeve with the play actors, that
                        the man who raises a hand agin a woman, 'cept when she deserves it, is a
                        coward whom it were base flattery to call an insect. So, instead o' <pb
                            id="VAA3891-161" n="156"/> lammin' Lize, I sot down in a corner an'
                        sulked. Bimeby she went down stairs to consult with Betse, an' I went to the
                        mantle board to light a seegyar, when I seen a bottle o' medicine. Jest
                        about that time, George, an idee struck me, an' I laid down on the floor an'
                        laughed until I nearly busted a blood-vessel. I must tell you about the
                        medicine. It was for Betse. Sick? Bless you, no! She never was sick a day in
                        her life, `cept on occasions when, `cordin' to my idees, it's no disgrace to
                        be sick, an' then she made mighty short work o' it. But you see sence she
                        got to runnin' with that old catamaran, she hed heerd her tellin' about her
                        durned nerves, until Betse come to think a woman couldn't be respectable
                        `thout she was nervous. Just think o' Betse with nerves! It's the most
                        ree-dicklus idee ever heerd of. But anyway she sent fur old Bolus, an' he
                        perscribed fur her nerves. George, d'ye know anything `bout drugs? Yes?
                        Well, then, you know there's nothin in the entire Mattera Medico as stinks
                        worse'n the valerianate of ammonia. It ain't a good square stink like
                        assyfitity, which you can wash off, or throw into the alley, but it is the
                        aw-fulest, pukinest smell in the world, more stinkin' `n limburg cheese, an'
                        when you once git it on you it hangs on like the seven year each. Well, this
                        medicine `told Bolus give Betse for `er nerves"&#151;(Here Mr. Bales
                        laughed inwardly and quietly for fifty seconds) "was mainly composed of
                        valerianate of ammonia. Long as you kep'it corked tight it didn't matter,
                        but the idee which I heve <pb id="VAA3891-162" n="157"/> heretofore
                        mentioned as havin' struck me, didn't comprise the keepin' of it corked
                        tight. So I jest emptied the entire bottle in Lize's Shetlin braid, an' then
                        jumped into a biled shirt, put on my velvet close, an' notified Mrs. Bales
                        that I'd make one o' that festive gatherin' myself, ef she had no
                        objections. Betse didn't like it, but she couldn't make any reasonable
                        objection. So I tuk root in the parlor, an' waited for the company.</p>
                    <p>That old Jezebel Flounce was the fust arrival, of course, an' then came, one
                        arter another, Wash Simpkins with his gal, an' Bill Porter with his gal, an'
                        a lot o' counterhoppers with their gals, an' a whole lot o' others dropped
                        in sort o' permiscuous, an' finally Charley Shannon, who's disposed to be
                        sweet on Lize, sneaked in, lookin' mighty oneasy in a new suit an' a pair o'
                        green kids. Lize was a little late in gettin' down, but she finally sailed
                        in, lookin' mighty nice, I must say. I must tell you, George, somethin'
                        about Lize, which you probably never knew, though you've known her sence she
                        was knee high to a duck. She can't smell a durned bit. She's mightily
                        ashamed of it, an' is always smellin' flowers, an' sayin', "how nice!" when
                        at the same time she might go right through Si Keck's soap factory, an'
                        never know the difference, `thout somebody told her. Well, when Lize cum
                        into the room a bowin' and simperin, and put-tin' on an immense amount of
                        style, thar was sum-thin' of a kermotion among the crowd. Old Flounce held
                        her nose, an' Betse's face got red-der'n a beat, while the young men looked
                        at each <pb id="VAA3891-163" n="158"/> other, an' kind o' snickered. Lize
                        went around among her company makin' herself agreeable, but somehow the
                        young men didn't seem to hanker arter her ez they used to, and would make
                        some excuse to sidle off. Then the gals begun to turn pale `bout the gills,
                        an' bimeby one arter another they slid out, a-holdin thar noses on the sly.
                        All this time I was a-settin' in the corner, looking mighty demure. Betse
                        finally whispered sumthin' in Lize's ear, an' she blushed scarlet, and then
                        bolted up stairs. Then when I seed Betse a work-in' over towards my corner,
                        I gathered my hat and cut. I begun to conclude it wasn't healthy fur me
                        about thar. Ez I was lumberin' up the street, chucklin' all over, I found
                        Charley Shannon, with his arm around a lamp post, a pukin' in the gutter.
                        He's a mighty finnicky sort o' a young man anyhow, an' I really thought he'd
                        turn inside out. Says I: "Mr. Shannon, I'm ashamed o' you. Who'd a thought
                        as nice a young man as you'd git bilin' drunk when he was goin' into
                        serciety?" Says he: "Bales, I aint drunk. I am only sick." Says I: "What
                        made ye sick, Charley?" The young man didn't know, but said he s'pected he'd
                        swallered a fly!</p>
                    <p>And that's how I come to be layin' out for the past three days, Georgey. I
                        was around pers-pectin' this mornin' to see ef it'd be safe to venture back,
                        and from sum remarks I overheard Betse an' Lize makin' techin' the
                        undersigned, I concluded it won't be wholesome. They was a diggin' a hole in
                        the back yard to bury the shinnion in, and Betse <pb id="VAA3891-164"
                            n="159"/> declared she'd hev a divorce, ef she hed to move back to
                        Injanny to get it. But she jest wanted to lay hands on me. Wouldn't she give
                        me hankins! I tell ye, George, I never saw her so worked up, an' I'm gettin'
                        kind o' oneasy `bout it. Couldn't you step round an' mollify the old lady?
                        Tell her ef I'd knowed it was goin' to stink so, I wouldn't a' done it. In
                        the meantime, let's go down to the S'Nichelus an' get some isters.</p>

                    <p>I <hi rend="sc">WONDER</hi> if any of my readers ever had a moon-stroke. Of
                        course I do not mean the kind of stroke to which masculine humanity is
                        peculiarly liable between the ages of eighteen and twenty-two, the effects
                        of which are loss of appetite, the purchase of a rhyming dictionary, and
                        lavish expenditure for perfumed hair oil, a cultivation of shirt collars and
                        a disposition to moonlight promenades, and furnace-like sighs. Such a stroke
                        as that comes from a pair of bright eyes, rather than the full-orbed moon,
                        and, I take it, every man who has something more than mere muscle thumping
                        against the ribs of his left side, has had it at least once in his life.
                        When I speak of a moon-stroke, I mean the mysterious and inexplicable
                        influence which that white, deceitful, and lovely orb exercises on the human
                        organism under certain circumstances&#151;an influence which baffles the
                        surgeon's skill, and drives men to madness and death.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps some skeptical reader may doubt the existence of such a thing as a
                        moon-stroke. I know such things have been. And why not? <pb id="VAA3891-166"
                            n="161"/> The moon exercises an influence&#151;a palpable and
                        powerful, but incomprehensible influence&#151;on the tides&#151;on
                        vegetation&#151;on the weather&#151;on the temper and temperament of
                        individuals, Ask your Dutch gardener. He will tell you that the moon
                        exercises a decided influence on vegetation; that certain crops which bear
                        their fruit beneath the earth must be planted in the "dark" of the moon, and
                        that other crops, which bear fruit above ground, must be planted in the
                        "light" of the moon. A farmer will also tell you that rails made of a tree
                        cut in the dark of the moon will rot quicker than those cut when the moon is
                        full. These things may be sneered at, but experience is often in advance of
                        science. I, for one, believe in the moon. I believe that it meddles to an
                        unwarrantable extent with sub-lunar affairs. I believe that it also
                        exercises a baneful influence on people under certain circumstances. I have
                        seen sailors off the Florida coast, lying down to sleep beneath a brilliant
                        tropical moon, take as much pains to shield themselves from its beams as
                        they would to protect them from the fierce rays of the tropical sun. Sailors
                        are naturally superstitious, and those of whom I speak firmly believed that
                        it was almost certain death to fall asleep in the glare of a full moon. A
                        grain of truth is found at the bottom of most popular superstitions, and so
                        it proved with regard to this. At the time I was skeptical. Afterwards I
                        came to believe fully in the superstitions of the sailors on the Florida
                        coast.</p>
                    <p>I was moon-struck myself. This is how it came <pb id="VAA3891-167" n="162"/>
                        about. I was in the army, a ferocious, rebel-eating defender of my country.
                        The regiment to which I was attached went to New Orleans with the cock-eyed
                        warrior nicknamed "the Beast," and was among the first to land at the wharf,
                        its splendid brass band, with a grim humor worthy of Suwarrow, striking
                        up&#151; <q direct="unspecified">
                            <lg>

                                <l n="2">Picayune Butler's coming to town,"</l>
                            </lg>
                        </q> as the cable was made fast, for the delectation of the rebel riff-raff
                        which thronged the wharf to witness the landing of the Goths and Vandals.
                        After performing "prodigies of valor" for a month, in the way of picking up
                        stray steamboats from their hiding places in the neighboring rivers and
                        bayous, exhuming brass cannons buried in the swamps and sacking an interior
                        town in revenge for the murder of two of our men, we were ordered to Baton
                        Rouge, and encamped in a beautiful magnolia grove about a mile from the
                        river, with a cheerful grave-yard in front and another on the left flank. By
                        one of those happy oversights which occur in rapid movements, we left our
                        tents behind at Algiers, and didn't get them for a fortnight. The grove in
                        which we pitched our camp-kettles was one of the loveliest spots in the
                        entire South. The stately magnolias, in full bloom, loaded the atmostphere
                        with their delicious fragrance, while smaller trees, matted with a luxuriant
                        overgrowth of muscadines and wild grape vines, formed natural arbors,
                        impervious to rain or dew. Hundreds of wild mocking birds fluttered among
                        the foliage, <pb id="VAA3891-168" n="163"/> while little chameleon lizards,
                        now bright green, and then a dull bark color, hung by their heels, head
                        downward, and curiously ogled, with their bright, twinkling eyes, the
                        sun-browned and dirty intruders, who lolled beneath the trees, and with
                        boisterous shouts disturbed the solitude. It was just on the outskirts of
                        the town, with neat residences, rose-embowered and hedged in with the lovely
                        white jessamine, then in full flower, on one hand, and near by corn fields,
                        with fences overgrown with the Cherokee rose, a luxuriant vining shrub,
                        bearing a profusion of white flowers. It was near the full moon, in the
                        lovely month of June, and, lulled by the drowsy hum of myriad insects, the
                        men would lie down after tattoo beneath the grape arbors or around the
                        gnarled roots of the magnolias, in the glorious light of a Southern moon,
                        sifted through the green enameled leaves, or poured in floods of radiance
                        through the open spaces, the glare being strong enough to render ordinary
                        newspaper print readable. The regiment was in high health, and so long as it
                        did not rain, no one cared for tents in this delightful weather and with
                        such surroundings.</p>
                    <p>A few nights of this life, however, were enough to put a large number of men
                        on the sick list. They did not know what was the matter with them, and,
                        strange enough, neither did the surgeons. They complained of no particular
                        pain, but a strange and oppressive feeling, in which the blood in the veins
                        seemed like molten lead, and brain and heart struggled beneath the weight of
                        some intolerable <pb id="VAA3891-169" n="164"/> burthen. Many took to the
                        hospital and soon got well, while others, with that horror of hospital life
                        which every good soldier feels, clung to the camp and grew rapidly worse.
                        Soon it got whispered around that it was the moon, and the more prudent of
                        the men took care to shield themselves from its baneful influence.</p>
                    <p>I was moon-struck with the rest.</p>
                    <p>I had been sleeping at the root of a large magnolia with a favorite sergeant,
                        and soon began to feel some weird influence unsettling and disorganizing my
                        nervous system. I often awoke in the night with a start, a nameless terror
                        lying upon me, and found the moonlight falling full upon my face, while the
                        dismal owls hooted and chattered in the branches overhead. My comrade was
                        affected similarly, only more severely. He was taken to the hospital, and,
                        without any apparent physical cause, died raving mad. Finally, I be-thought
                        me of the superstition of the Florida sailors, and henceforth shunned the
                        moonlight. In a short time my symptoms disappeared, and I recovered from my
                        moon-stroke. But I have never been on good terms with that deceitful planet
                        since.</p>
                    <p>If any one is disposed to doubt this supposed influence of the moon, let me
                        call his attention to the phenomena of sun-stroke. What is it that causes
                        men to drop and die in the streets of our crowded cities in July and August?
                        Not the mere matter of heat, certainly; for men who work in engine rooms and
                        about furnaces can bear many more degrees of heat, with little or no
                        inconvenience, <pb id="VAA3891-170" n="165"/> than that which kills people
                        by a sun-stroke. A puddler in a rolling mill is literally roasted every day
                        of his life, and men have been known to go into an oven with a roast of beef
                        and remain until the meat was thoroughly cooked. It is some chemical action
                        of the sun's rays which produces death. And is it not possible that there is
                        a pernicious and fatal chemistry in a tropical moonlight?</p>

                    <head>DOGS THAT I HAVE KNOWN.</head>
                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">LL</hi> my life I have been an admirer of dogs&#151;so
                        much so, that I never meet one in the street, if he be at all presentable,
                        without an inclination to stop and exchange compliments of the
                        day&#151;to tell him the political news and business prospects, and
                        receive in exchange an account of his chase of the neighbor's cat last
                        night; his tremendous fight with the rural dog under wood-hauler's wagon,
                        and his luck or ill luck in foraging for bones. There is so much human
                        nature in dogs, that I can not find it in my heart to deny them the
                        possession of souls to lose or save, were it not for one peculiarity so
                        utterly out of character as to overset the human hypothesis, and reduce my
                        four-legged friends to the level of brutish beasts. To begin with the human
                        characteristics of the dog. What is more human than the conduct of a dog in
                        a dog fight? I don't mean <hi rend="i">his</hi> fight&#151;the fight
                        which he originates, and in which he is immediately concerned&#151;the
                        fight in which he gets his ears lacerated and his legs "chawed" off. I speak
                        of fights in which he ought to be a disinterested spectator, were he not <pb
                            id="VAA3891-172" n="167"/> possessed of human weaknesses. Look at Crunch
                        asleep on the doorstep. Drays and omnibusses thunder over the stony
                        street&#151;children play around him, and there he lies, "dreaming of
                        chase or fray." Touch him with your foot and he lazily uncloses one eye,
                        sees that it is only a silly joke, and relapses into the arms of the canine
                        Morpheus, perhaps with a muttered anathema, in dog latin, on your
                        inconsiderate interference with his postprandial <hi rend="i">siesta.</hi>
                        But let a dog fight be inaugurated anywhere within a radius of two squares,
                        and witness the marvelous transformation. In an instant he is quivering with
                        excitement. Taking the bearings of the sound, he rushes off at headlong
                        speed, falling in with other dogs bent on the same errand. He runs cheek by
                        jowl with his bitterest enemy&#151;the dog across the
                        way&#151;without stopping to snarl at him. Arriving at the ground, he
                        and all the other spectators pitch in without knowing anything of the merits
                        of the dispute, invariably fastening on the <hi rend="i">under dog.</hi> In
                        this way I have seen some poor fiste attacked by a larger dog, literally
                        lifted off the ground by the arrival of reinforcements&#151;a dozen
                        canine muzzles fastened upon him, each pulling in a contrary direction.</p>
                    <p>This is eminently human.</p>
                    <p>When a fellow-creature gets a start down hill, everybody hastens to give an
                        accelerating kick.</p>
                    <p>The parallel is a little short, however, and the dog is beneath the human in
                        this, that he respects sex. No dog, however dissipated or depraved, is <pb
                            id="VAA3891-173" n="168"/> mean enough to attack a female. With human
                        creatures, sex is a matter of no account.</p>
                    <p>Again; notice your dog when he comes suddenly upon a female of the species.
                        What a sudden and complete transformation, and how positively handsome he
                        makes himself, all at once. [Charles Reade has alluded to this in one of his
                        novels, but it is true, nevertheless.] How we are reminded of certain
                        two-legged puppies by the sudden friskiness which has overtaken our
                        four-legged friend.</p>
                    <p>Now we come to the evidence for the defense.</p>
                    <p>The dog is unlike the human in this, that there is no dross of selfishness in
                        his friendships. The dog is not mercenary. He is a faithful friend until
                        death. In the language of the pathetic little ballad of "Old Dog Tray,"
                        which some of my friends may have heard some years since&#151; <q
                            direct="unspecified">
                            <lg>
                                <l n="1">"Beef can not coax him away."</l>
                            </lg>
                        </q> No odds how poor you are, or how insufficiently your larder may be
                        supplied, the dog you have raised from a pup is constant in his love. He
                        will cheerfully endure cold, hunger and cruel treatment, rather than give
                        you up. He does not desert you in misfortune, but is constant through life,
                        and in this is either more or less than human.</p>
                    <p>But this generalization will never do. I started out to tell of individual
                        dogs&#151;not to write a dogmatic essay on dogs in the abstract.</p>
                    <p>The first dog of any character I remember was "Old Bounce." O. B. was a
                        "yaller" brindle, more mastiff than anything else, and had lived long in
                        this cruel world, during which time he had <pb id="VAA3891-174" n="169"/>
                        established a character for honesty, truth and veracity which was the envy
                        and admiration of every dog in the neighborhood. Old Bounce could be trusted
                        with untold meat, and could sleep with a sheep without developing a
                        "hankering" for mutton. He never lied by barking up an empty tree in
                        squirrel hunting, and was reliable as a watch-dog. When I first knew Old
                        Bounce he was a pensioner on full pay, being kept in affluence on account of
                        the good he had done. Strange as it may seem, having passed through the
                        dangers of puppyhood and doghood with honor untarnished, Bounce became
                        demoralized in his old age. One day some hams were put out to sun, and one
                        of them was missing when it came to a count. There was consternation in the
                        household. Circumstantial evidence pointed to Old Bounce, but they were loth
                        to suspect him. Patram, one of the colored people, volunteered to solve the
                        problem with a little black fiste belonging to him. The fiste was brought up
                        to the scene of the theft, and being a shrewd dog, was made to understand
                        what was required of him. He circled around the locality, and finally struck
                        a trail leading off through the fields in the direction of a willow swamp
                        about a quarter of mile from the house. Old Bounce was lying half asleep in
                        the sun, lazily looking on, but when the fiste took the trail, he manifested
                        unusual interest for an old dog in the proceedings. He followed the crowd,
                        overtook the little dog, and, with erect bristles, remonstrated against his
                        meddling in the ham business. It is possible that he <pb id="VAA3891-175"
                            n="170"/> even offered to bribe him with a liberal dividend of the meat,
                        but the faithful detective scorned his anger and his promises. As the party
                        neared the swamp, Old B. got more uneasy&#151;his bristles stiffened
                        like spikes of iron, and his growling, as he planted himself in front of the
                        little dog, became fiercer and more threatening. Finally the little dog
                        stopped at a point where there were signs of the earth having been freshly
                        stirred, and began to dig. Then Old Bounce bounced on him and began to "eat
                        him up," but was beaten off. Patram took a stick and soon exhumed the
                        missing ham, whereupon Bounce tucked his tail between his legs and sneaked
                        off. He could never look one of the family in the face after that. Remorse,
                        like a vulture, gnawed at his vitals, and he went into a rapid decline.</p>
                    <p>The recollection of another dog lingers pleasantly in the memory of early
                        boyhood. He was a nondescript, apparently made up of half a dozen different
                        breeds&#151;short and corpulent, with little legs looking like sticks
                        driven into his absurd body. "Ring's" best hold was rabbit
                        hunting&#151;not that he ever caught a rabbit, for he couldn't catch a
                        terrapin in a square race&#151;but he was beastly fond of the sport. I
                        am wrong, however, in saying he never caught a rabbit. He did catch one. It
                        was chased by other dogs, and jumped through a crack in a worm fence. Ring,
                        who was watching the chase through the fence, caught the hare "on the fly."
                        He always accompanied us on our rabbit hunting excursions, and frequently
                            <pb id="VAA3891-176" n="171"/> had to be carried home, either "giving
                        out" on account of his corpulency, or running sideways against a tree and
                        breaking his back. He moved best in straight lines, and was a poor dog on a
                        curve or sharp turn. Ring was one of those dogs who are constantly
                        overestimating their powers. With a word of encouragement he would fly at
                        the largest bull dog, running at the top of his speed until he arrived
                        within a couple of rods of the enemy, when his gait would gradually slacken
                        until, just previous to the moment of impact, he would come to a dead halt,
                        and the threatened fight would end in inglorious smelling, and scratching
                        the earth with hind feet. At the start and for the first fifty yards, Ring
                        would be fully impressed with the idea that he was going to eat the big dog,
                        body and bones, but his courage oozed as the distance diminished, until,
                        when it came to actual contact, he was the meekest and most conciliatory of
                        dogs. R ng came to his death in a horrible manner. One day while hunting
                        rabbits with a mixed pack of curs, bull dogs and bull terriers, we "treed" a
                        `coon in a brush pile. Ring's education went no farther than rabbits, but he
                        was a meddlesome and inquisitive animal, and worked himself into the heap
                        until he came upon the `coon in front, and quietly began to smell it. Cooney
                        fastened on his nose with a death grip, and Ring set up a dreadful
                        "yowl."</p>
                    <p>At this critical moment a white bull terrier, noted for his prowess in
                        fights, and for the smooth dexterity with which he could bite off a pig's
                        tail close <pb id="VAA3891-177" n="172"/> to the root, worked his way
                        through the heap on the opposite side, and seized the coon in the rear.
                        "Bob" held to the coon, and the coon held to Ring, so that both were dragged
                        through the heap and out in the open air. By one of those awkward mistakes
                        which will happen with the best regulated dogs, in the hurry of business,
                        the other dogs fastened on poor Ring instead of the coon, and he was
                        literally torn to pieces, while the coon escaped. They felt badly about it,
                        after it was all over, but as Ring looked as much like a coon as a dog, the
                        mistake was quite natural.</p>
                    <p>"Music" was another remarkable dog with which I enjoyed an intimate
                        acquaintance. He was a hound, coal black and tan, with long, pendant ears,
                        and the most magnificent voice I ever heard. He could fill the entire woods
                        with it. It was deep, sonorous, capable of extraordinary modulation, and
                        full of melody. I do not remember anything finer than the cry of this dog,
                        reverberating through the hills and valleys, and it was one of his
                        characteristics to give tongue as readily in pursuit of a weasel as he would
                        have done in a bear chase. Music was designed for foxes, but never having
                        had any education in that line, his genius was expended on rabbits,
                        squirrels, coons, and other small game. He belonged to a relation in the
                        country whom I used to visit, and was passionately fond of the chase. He
                        would go out by himself, strike a coon trail, follow it to the coon's
                        harbor, in some hollow tree, and then take the "back track." Thus he would
                        go back and forth <pb id="VAA3891-178" n="173"/> for hours, making the
                        forest resound with his melodious yells. Music was not devoid of personal
                        courage. Indeed, when pressed to the wall, he would fight savagely, and
                        always to win. But in his intercourse with man or boy he was the most abject
                        coward I ever saw. Make a motion to strike him, and he would whop over on
                        his back, and lie there shivering in pitiful terror, emitting a fresh howl
                        with every motion of the threatening arm. With true boyish malignity I used
                        to terrify poor Music in this manner, until one day an occurrence, as
                        horrible as it was ridiculous, and altogether too painful to relate, put an
                        end to this persecution on my part. Music finally got into bad odor with the
                        neighbors, on account of certain transactions in mutton, and was given away
                        to a mover. The last I ever saw of him he was tied to the rear axle of the
                        wagon, where they hang the tar bucket, and was mournfully trotting westward
                        ho!</p>
                    <p>A Newfoundland, with which I was on excellent terms, once conducted himself
                        in a manner excessively human. Some spoiled hams had been thrown out, and
                        Major took one of them and buried it behind the Methodist church. Just as he
                        was shoveling the dirt over his commissary stores, his master came out, and
                        started up town. Major left the job unfinished, and followed his master. A
                        little, half-starved mongrel, who had been watching the proceedings, went to
                        the hole as soon as Major was out of sight, and began to unearth the
                        treasure. It happened that Major's master did not stay long up town, and in
                        passing the church on the return trip <pb id="VAA3891-179" n="174"/> the dog
                        remembered the ham, and thought he might as well finish the job. He came
                        upon the scene of action just as the little thief was tugging at the shank,
                        in the effort to drag the ham away. Maje came down on him like an avalanche,
                        with an explosion of fierce barks, an angry mouthing, and an energetic
                        "wooling," which augured speedy death to the little culprit, who was howling
                        dismally in hopeless terror. It was soon evident, however, that Maje scorned
                        to hurt so small a dog, and that he was only teaching him a lesson through
                        the medium of salutary fright. After shaking and wallowing him in the dirt,
                        he stood astride of him, and, looking down upon the little wretch, who was
                        lying still as death, growled fiercely. After standing over him for a couple
                        of minutes, Maje slowly withdrew, looking backward as he went. At the
                        slightest movement of the little dog towards getting up, Maje would return
                        and give him another shaking. Finally, after getting away a dozen yards, and
                        finding the little rascal made no attempt to get up, Maje gave him a parting
                        growl, and trotted off, leaving both ham and dog. As soon as the little dog
                        found his oppressor had really gone, he got up with alacrity, and made
                        remarkable time in getting away, without even taking a farewell smell of the
                        ham which had seduced him from the path of rectitude.</p>
                    <p>I once knew a dog&#151;a low breed, "yaller," long-bodied fiste, with
                        short and very crooked legs&#151;that would go on the opposite side of a
                        tree and shake a bush, to frighten the squirrel around so that <pb
                            id="VAA3891-180" n="175"/> you could get a shot at it. I don't ask
                        anybody to believe this story. I shouldn't believe it myself, if I had not
                        seen it, time and again.</p>
                    <p>In the town of C&#151;n, Illinois, is, or was, a dog whose facial
                        expression inevitably reminded you of a merchant in the same town. The
                        likeness was startling, and attracted the attention of even strangers. This
                        dog was positively the ugliest and most ill-favored animal I ever saw, and
                        yet he was a general favorite with everybody. A kindly, genial expression
                        shone through the crust of his horrid ugliness of countenance, and he had a
                        deprecatory, apologetic air, which seemed to say, "Good people, I know it;
                        but I can't help it&#151;really I mean no harm by it." So striking was
                        the likeness between the dog and M&#151;, that he was called by the
                        merchant's name. The latter was annoyed to the verge of distraction by it,
                        and offered a fabulous price for the dog, with a view to expatriation; but
                        the owner, who disliked the merchant, refused to sell at any price.</p>
                    <p>A peculiarity about dogs in general is the manner in which they reflect the
                        characteristics of their masters. I can tell any lady's peculiarities of
                        temper much more satisfactorily by cultivating and studying her lap-dog than
                        any phrenologist can by feeling her head. The dog naturally acquires much of
                        the disposition of his master.</p>
                    <p>I could fill columns with anecdotes of dogs that I have known, but with one
                        more example I will leave the subject. I once had a dog&#151;a large,
                        lumbering, corn-colored whelp&#151;whose antipathy <pb id="VAA3891-181"
                            n="176"/> was cats. Pomp was an inveterate cat hunter. He hunted them in
                        the gray light of the early morning, at noon, by moonlight&#151;at all
                        times; and would snake a cat out of a door-step or window, and slay it with
                        admirable dexterity. Our own cat he would not exactly kill, but he would
                        take her out and bury her in the snow, and worry her until she was on the
                        point of giving up the ghost. Pomp was a quarrelsome dog, and constantly
                        engaged in fights with his neighbors. He had a curious system of defense
                        which was entirely original with him. He would deliver his attack, and when
                        his antagonist turned upon him, instead of presenting his front, like other
                        dogs, he would present his rear. Other dogs could never fathom the depth of
                        this strategy, and Pomp generally came off victor. I am inclined to think
                        that this system of defense originated in Pomp's personal vanity. He thought
                        too much of the beauty of his face to imperil it by meeting an attack in the
                        usual way. When it rained, Pomp became a different dog. He would lie for a
                        week at a time growling at everybody and everything, but never moving unless
                        punched up with a pole. He finally fell a victim to hydrophobia.</p>

                    <head>DUCK SHOOTING IN LOUISIANA.</head>
                    <p>In the fall and winter of 1862, the writer played for a short time an
                        unimportant engagement as prisoner of war. Unlike thousands who dragged out
                        a miserable existence for one or two years in the crowded prison pens of
                        Georgia or North Carolina, his lot was cast in a section of country which
                        had, as yet, but few prisoners, and where the few they did have were
                        generally well treated, and furnished with abundance of food, not such as an
                        epicure would select from an ample bill of fare, but wholesome in quality.
                        The period of my confinement was most refreshingly brief, being only two
                        months, inclusive of fourteen days at the Washington Hotel in Vicksburg. In
                        company with a small number of Western men, the writer was sent down with a
                        detachment of the 8th Vermont, which had been gobbled at Bayou des
                        Allemands, under circumstances not particularly creditable to the officers
                        in command, having surrendered a partially fortified position, defended by
                        cannon, without firing a shot. To signify his disapprobation of the
                        surrender, Old Strabismus ordered the whole detachment <pb id="VAA3891-183"
                            n="178"/> to Ship Island, to await exchange. Now, the writer knew
                        something of Ship Island&#151;a bleak, desolate patch of barrenness,
                        with its infernal winds, and drifting sands, and its scarcity of
                        edibles&#151;and whatever views Gen. Butler might entertain of its
                        salubrity, he determined he would not go there, at least not without a
                        struggle. Court-martial lost its terrors when the recollection of Ship
                        Island returned in all its horrid freshness. So the writer
                        bolted&#151;ran away&#151;not to put too fine a point on it,
                        deserted. And that is how he came to know so much about duck shooting in
                        Louisiana.</p>
                    <p>My regiment was lying mostly at Brashear City, some companies detailed for
                        naval service on the gunboats, and the balance sloshing round
                        miscellaneously. Our sutler, John McMillan, was making up a sugar crop on
                        Osgood's plantation, about fifteen miles above the city of New
                        Orleans&#151;Mr. Osgood's negroes having run away and left the old
                        gentleman in the lurch with a fine crop of cane, and no means of converting
                        it into sugar. Ed. Parsley and John Bodfish were trying their hands at
                        "overseeing," and, being a particular friend of Ed.'s, the Osgood plantation
                        offered extraordinary inducements to a prisoner on parole, with the delights
                        Ship Island held <hi rend="i">in terrorem</hi> over his head. Plantation
                        life in the sugar season is exhilarating and interesting. The busy hands
                        hauling and stripping cane, and clearing away "bagasse"&#151;the immense
                        steaming kettles, with their queer names&#151;the excitement of making
                        "a strike," and the wild barbaric chant of the dusky, perspiring sugar <pb
                            id="VAA3891-184" n="179"/> boilers&#151;are all interesting to the
                        stranger. The sugar boilers are <hi rend="i">improvisatores</hi> on a grand
                        scale, and will continue for hours, weaving the most commonplace incidents
                        as well as the wildest fancies of Obeah and Voudoo superstition into their
                        chants, and the effect sometimes is wierd, and unearthly to an almost
                        painful degree. At these times the savage element in the African seems to
                        reassert itself, and the civilization he has absorbed is, for the nonce,
                        overshadowed by his barbaric nature. I had taken notes of some of these wild
                        improvisations, but regret to say they have been lost, and treacherous
                        memory fails to recall their burden. The favorite, however, was the chorus
                        of&#151; <q direct="unspecified">
                            <lg>
                                <l n="1">"Old Stormy, storm, storm along,"</l>
                            </lg>
                        </q> roared out in a grand combination of powerful voices, with a running
                        commentary of such incidents and fancies as occurred to the leader and
                        composer, who was known to the white folks only as "Old Stormy."</p>
                    <p>Getting a little tired of plantation life, I cast about me for something more
                        exciting than grinding cane and studying African character. Borrowing a gun,
                        I began a series of explorations on the verge of the swamp back of the
                        plantation, occasionally bagging a few snipe, a rail, heron or a brace of
                        black, worthless ducks, and making havoc among the great flocks of crows
                        which infested the plantation. In one of these excursions I wandered down to
                        the neighboring plantation below, belonging to a fat and jolly Creole
                        Frenchman named Cavalier. <pb id="VAA3891-185" n="180"/> A couple of
                        green-winged teal, passing by, fell to a double shot, which I flattered
                        myself was rather neat, and while examining the beautiful birds and
                        congratulating myself that my right arm had not forgotten its cunning, old
                        Cavalier, mounted on a trifle of a mule, wearing a broad-brimmed,
                        ginger-colored felt chapeau, which he had converted into an impromptu cocked
                        hat, giving him something of the appearance of the Third Reader pictures of
                        the great Napoleon, rode up and congratulated me on the shot. It was easy to
                        see that the old man was something of a sportsman, and his eyes glistened as
                        he told me in his broken English about the good shooting down the bayou and
                        out at the lake. He volunteered to lend me a pirogue and a negro to paddle
                        it, so that I might enjoy a good day's duck shooting. I was not slow to
                        avail myself of his kind offer, and accompanying him to the house, he called
                        "Justin"&#151;a bright-looking young fellow, black as Erebus and dressed
                        in clean corduroy coat and breeches, white shirt and big leather boots, the
                        tops of which came above his knees. Justin emerged from a squad of shady
                        laborers, who were engaged in winnowing rice, and grinning good humoredly,
                        politely asked what was wanted. I was not very well up in French, but
                        knowing beforehand the purport of the conversation, I readily followed the
                        Jolly Cavalier and the dusky Justin in their rapid talk, consisting of three
                        parts of nasal pronunciation and one of shoulder shrugging. One thing,
                        however, puzzled me. The old man was <pb id="VAA3891-186" n="181"/>
                        particular to know if Justin could swim. I didn't understand his anxiety at
                        the time.</p>
                    <p>I saw the point a few days after, when I learned that the art of swimming had
                        saved old Cavalier a negro.</p>
                    <p>Justin took me to the boat-house, where he selected one of the largest of the
                        pirogues and launched it in the little canal. A pirogue, simple reader, is
                        an invention of the evil one. It is a light, shallow canoe, hollowed out of
                        the trunk of the cottonwood, sycamore, or sweet gum, and capable of bearing
                        one or two persons, according to its size&#151;always provided that
                        discretion is exercised. The seats are close to the bottom. You can no more
                        stand up in, or sit on the gunwales of a pirogue without capsizing, than you
                        can climb the steepest curve of a greased rainbow. The pirogue won't stand
                        any nonsense, and is a perfect trap for lubbers. You see a pirogue lying at
                        the bank, and think you will step in and take a ride. You do step in, and
                        the treacherous thing shoots from under you quicker than lightning, and the
                        first thing you know you are turning a back summersault into the water,
                        while the little thing is riding a half-dozen rods out in the stream.
                        Properly managed however, a pirogue is graceful as a fawn and tractable as
                        the woman who loves you.</p>
                    <p>We boarded the pirogue, and Justin shot it swiftly down the little canal and
                        into the bayou, a deep, sluggish stream, varying from fifty to a hundred and
                        fifty feet in width, the water of a dark, inky hue, and full of garr fish,
                        with hundreds of loath-some <pb id="VAA3891-187" n="182"/> alligators
                        sunning themselves on its banks. Along this little stream flocks of a bird
                        which the creoles call <hi rend="i">poulet d'eau,</hi> or water hen, but
                        which I believe to be the coot, were constantly flying, passing recklessly
                        to and fro within easy shot of the pirogue. The <hi rend="i">poulet
                            d'eau</hi> is dark blue in color, with a pink beak. They rise with
                        difficulty from the water, their legs and web feet, which are set farther
                        back than those of a duck, paddling the water like the buckets of a
                        stern-wheel steamer, for several rods before they get clearly afloat in the
                        air. The flesh of the <hi rend="i">poulet d'eau</hi> is very dark, but sweet
                        and juicy, with a strong gamy flavor like that of the snipe, but less
                        delicate. They are little esteemed among the creoles, probably on account of
                        their great abundance and the ease with which they are bagged, but I
                        preferred them for the table to anything except the green-winged teal. Along
                        with the multitudes of these silly creatures were occasional flocks of teal,
                        mallards, grey ducks, spoon bills, and a duck the exact counterpart of the
                        famous canvas-back, but lacking the exquisite flavor that bird derives from
                        the wild celery on which it feeds. On either side was a region of
                        interminable swamp, overgrown with heavy weeds, or tall, coarse grass, and
                        infested with the filthy moccasin snake and other poisonous reptiles. It
                        also abounded in varieties of the rail, some of which were brilliant in
                        plumage.</p>
                    <p>Down this bayou Justin swiftly paddled our pirogue. He was an adept in the
                        sport. Stealing swiftly and noiselessly around some point in the <pb
                            id="VAA3891-188" n="183"/> bayou, and shooting from behind the
                        inevitable clump of willows, he would bring me right into the midst of a
                        party of mallards, quacking and grubbing in the floating moss, or foraging
                        among the reeds along the bank. It was late in the day when we entered the
                        bayou, but by sun-down I had bagged a dozen or more fat, juicy quacks.</p>
                    <p>On several occasions we repeated our visits to the bayou. Justin was always
                        eager to go, and in payment for his services received ammunition, preferring
                        it to money. Once he obtained a furlough for the entire day, and proposed we
                        should have a grand hunt, agreeing to take me into the lake and around to
                        another bayou less frequented, where game was even more abundant. We got an
                        early start. The air was crisp, with a thick fog hanging over the bayou.
                        During some six winters' residence in Louisiana I had never known one so
                        fine as this. The roses and other sweet scented flowers bloomed
                        uninterruptedly. But to resume.</p>
                    <p>We pushed along the bayou in the fog, unable to distinguish anything two rods
                        in front of us. We would constantly hear the ducks rising ahead of us, and
                        by watching until they rose above the belt of fog, could get good shots.
                        Justin had brought his gun along, and joined in the sport. He was positively
                        the most entertaining negro I ever met, and was a <hi rend="i">lusus
                            natur&#156;</hi> in one particular. He would not touch liquor of any
                        kind, alleging that it made him sick. He was not troubled with scruples, for
                        he would sometimes beg my flask for <pb id="VAA3891-189" n="184"/> some of
                        his friends whom we occasionally met on the water. He spoke English
                        fluently, with a French accent, and had the drollest way of biting off
                        English words in the middle.</p>
                    <p>We paddled along the bayou, at first shooting everything that came within
                        shot, but finally becoming more fastidious, and only accepting choice ducks.
                        The sun had dispelled the fog, and we came out into the lake, a broad sheet
                        of blue water, covered for half a mile out with myriads of <hi rend="i"
                            >poulet d'eaux</hi> and ducks of every variety, while stinking
                        cormorants and lazy herons flew hither and yon. Here Justin showed me one of
                        his tricks to "fool 'em." Cutting off two or three reeds close to the water,
                        he selected some fine ducks from those we had killed, and fastened their
                        bills to the cut reeds so that they would sit easily and naturally in the
                        water. Then running the pirogue into the reeds he masked it effectually, and
                        began an imitation of duck-talk so natural as to deceive the wariest old
                        mallard that ever lived. Troops of mallards began circling around, craning
                        their long necks about in all directions, looking sharply out for traps,
                        while flocks of the foolish <hi rend="i">poulet d'eaux</hi> swam lazily
                        toward the decoys. Finally a flock of twelve or fifteen swooped down and
                        alighted on the water within a dozen rods of our "Forneys." Others followed,
                        and soon at least thirty fine ducks, closely massed, were swimming toward
                        us. They were already within easy shot, but anxious to study their habits I
                        motioned the impatient Justin to hold his fire. Unsuspiciously they
                        approached until the decoys <pb id="VAA3891-190" n="185"/> were surrounded
                        with ducks and coots. Finally an old, weather-beaten mallard, who seemed to
                        be the leader, swam up to the decoys and politely made his morning
                        salutation. Just about that time old green crest made a discovery. Rapidly
                        backing off, he took a frightened look, and with a startled "qu-a-a-a-a-ck,
                        quack, quack!" expressive of the most abject terror, he rose from the water.
                        There was a splashing and spluttering, and the whole flock of birds were in
                        the air. Bang, bang, went all of our barrels in quick succession, and there
                        was a rapid decline in feathers. We picked up seventeen ducks and coots, and
                        Justin was highly delighted with the success of his attempt at fooling
                        them.</p>
                    <p>We paddled around to the other bayou, where we found game abundant. Large
                        flocks of teal would rise out of the reeds immediately in front of us, or
                        fly right into our faces. We killed until we were satiated with slaughter,
                        and then started to return. Paddling lazily along, I heard a flapping in the
                        reeds. Something red gleamed among the fading green of the cane leaves, and
                        a large scarlet flamingo rose lazily above their tops and was making off. If
                        it had been an elephant, or flying dragon, I could not have been more
                        unsettled. I fired nervously and quickly with my right, and, of course,
                        missed. Taking deliberate aim with the left, resolved this time to make a
                        sure thing of it, I pulled trigger, and for the first time the gun failed. I
                        could have plunged into the oozy bed of the bayou and drowned myself with
                        sheer vexation, when <pb id="VAA3891-191" n="186"/> the cheerful crack of
                        Justin's gun sounded in my ear, and the flamingo tied himself into a knot
                        and tumbled headlong among the reeds. Justin waded in and brought the
                        beautiful bird to the pirogue. He was as fine a specimen as I ever saw,
                        nearly as large as a sand-hill crane, and with every feather as clean and
                        bright as it was possible to be. I took him home, got some arsenic and
                        attempted to make a specimen of my prize. I failed, however, through want of
                        skill, and the noble bird spoiled on my hands.</p>
                    <p>Returning up the first bayou, I learned the secret of old Cavalier's anxiety
                        to know whether Justin could swim or not. The appetite for slaughter came
                        back as we left the game region, and we began popping over ducks and <hi
                            rend="i">poulet d'eaux</hi> indiscriminately. As I before remarked, a
                        pirogue isn't a good thing to stand up in, but loading the gun while sitting
                        was very awkward business. In many places the bayou was covered with a
                        carpet of thick, rope-like moss, forming in some places a perfect matting,
                        through which it was almost impossible to force the pirogue. By running the
                        prow on to one of these moss banks, it was possible to stand up and load.
                        Justin had often cautioned me against this, but I thought I was something of
                        an expert in pirogue tactics, and scorned his timid fears. I had just shot a
                        large gray duck, and was loading on one of these moss banks. A negro in a
                        pirogue further down the bayou attracted my attention, and while intently
                        watching him, I felt our vessel careening over. Justin gave a warning <pb
                            id="VAA3891-192" n="187"/> shout, and threw his weight on the other
                        side. It was too late, however, and feeling that a catastrophe was
                        inevitable, and preferring to enter the water feet foremost, I jumped out,
                        gun in hand. Relieved of my superior weight, the treacherous little shell
                        whopped over on the other side, and turned bottom upward, spilling Justin,
                        our load of game, lunch-basket, and such clothing as we had laid aside on
                        account of the heat, into the water. Still holding to my gun, I sank through
                        the bed of moss and plumbed the bottom, about eight feet. I shot upward
                        again, still holding the gun, and spouted a column of dirty water, like a
                        whale. I had no fear of drowning, being a good swimmer, and bearing in mind
                        a proverb about certain persons destined to a dryer death, but soon found I
                        had not fully comprehended the situation. In struggling to keep my head
                        above water, the infernal moss wound around my legs, arms and neck, until I
                        was as helpless as a swathed mummy, while every kick or stroke of the arm
                        only fixed me more firmly in the devilish toils.</p>
                    <p>I began to be alarmed, and felt myself turning pale. At such times men think
                        rapidly, and in less than ten seconds I had retrospected my entire
                        life&#151;the mean things of which I had been guilty being especially
                        prominent in the picture. I thought it was rather rough that I should have
                        escaped the vicissitudes of a soldier's life, to be finally drowned in a
                        stinking bayou, like a blind puppy or superfluous kitten, and I remember
                        that the absurd story of the French soldier who had <pb id="VAA3891-193"
                            n="188"/> followed Napoleon through a hundred battles without a scratch,
                        and was finally kicked to death by a camp mule, presented itself with
                        ludicrous force. I saw the ravenous garr and slimy cat-fish fighting over my
                        bones, and above all I wished I was well out of it. Then I heard Justin's
                        voice, shouting to me to let go the gun and hold on to the moss. I did so,
                        and soon found that a watery grave was not near so imminent as I had feared.
                        By simply keeping still, a very slight motion was sufficient to stay my head
                        above water, and so I remained until the faithful African took the pirogue
                        ashore, righted it, and came to the rescue. Tearing the moss from my neck
                        and arms, he soon extricated me. I felt disposed to make for the shore, as
                        it was impossible to get into the shell while it was in the water. But both
                        guns were overboard, and Justin wanted to recover them. He proposed to dive
                        for them, but remembering that the water was not deep, and reflecting that
                        the muzzle of the gun was heaviest, it occurred to me that they might be
                        found standing perpendicularly with the wooden breech uppermost. Holding to
                        the side of the pirogue, I began exploring with my feet, and soon had the
                        inexpressible satisfaction of feeling what I was looking for. Grasping the
                        breech with my feet, I raised it until I could reach it with my hands. The
                        other gun I recovered in the same manner. Then, gathering up our game, which
                        amounted to a boat-load, we went ashore, where I drained the water out of my
                        boots, and the whisky out of the flask. The air <pb id="VAA3891-194" n="189"
                        /> was balmy enough, but it was January, nevertheless, and the water chilly.
                        I was soon shivering and chattering like a monkey, despite the heavy draft
                        of "commissary." I got into the pirogue, and taking the extra paddle, we
                        made the little shell fairly dance through the water. Arrived at the boat
                        house, I gave Justin as much of the game as he could carry, and walked
                        briskly to the plantation, where Ed. furnished me with dry clothing, and
                        sent down a cart for the game. I never took the trouble to count it, but
                        there was enough for the whole plantation.</p>
                    <p>This was my last day's duck-shooting in Louisiana. A few day's later I
                        received the joyful (?) intelligence that I was exchanged, with an
                        intimation from the colonel that he would be pleased to see me at
                        headquarters.</p>

                        <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> Twenty-first Regiment Indiana Volunteers, Col. J.
                            W. McMillan, having completed its organization and equipment, left Camp
                            Vajen, Indianapolis, in the latter part of July, 1861, via Dayton, for
                            the East. This regiment was generally conceded to be among the finest,
                            if not the finest, that had left that State. Col. McMillan, by his
                            untiring energy and assiduous attention to business in organizing it,
                            won golden opinions from all. Starting several weeks behind the others,
                            he had the proud satisfaction of being the first of the new regiments in
                            the field. The regiment was entirely full&#151;101 in each company,
                            with an excellent band&#151;1,050 in all.</p>
                        <p>At Dayton, at which place we arrived about eleven o'clock at night, the
                            citizens had prepared a collation for the troops, which was very good in
                                <pb id="VAA3891-196" n="191"/> its way, only there was not enough of
                            it. The first division fared well, but the second made a very light
                            repast.</p>
                        <p>All the way from Columbus, via Steubenville, our journey was a continuous
                            ovation. Throngs of people lined the way at each stopping place,
                            cheering and waving handkerchiefs, while fair ladies passed up and down
                            the long trains, distributing refreshments to the grateful troops.
                            Quartermaster Hinkley, Adjutant Latham, and Captain Roy, were
                            particularly susceptible to the attraction of the bright eyes that
                            flashed glances of welcome and encouragement from the roadside. Capt.
                            Hinkley, who was a handsome man, and rather impressible, was a source of
                            unceasing trouble to the regiment. At every station he was held until
                            the train was in motion, by the attractions of a conversation with some
                            little witch in crinoline and curls, and would have to make a flying
                            leap to the platform. By the time we reached Frazerville, our
                            quartermaster became entirely unmanageable. At Coshocton it was found
                            necessary to chain him.</p>
                        <p>While all along the route through Ohio, the citizens manifested the
                            utmost good feeling, the kind people of Coshocton and Steubenville were
                            worthy of especial mention. At the former place, in addition to the
                            usual refreshments, citizens passed along the line distributing quarters
                            and half dollars to the men.</p>
                        <p>When we left Indianapolis, it was the understanding that our destination
                            was Washington, but on arriving at Baltimore we were ordered into camp
                                <pb id="VAA3891-197" n="192"/> at Locust Point, a little point of
                            land, nice, clean and grassy, in the rear of Fort McHenry, with the salt
                            water on either side of us</p>
                        <p>Our reception on the march through Baltimore was "a little mixed." From
                            many windows small editions of the American flag, and handkerchiefs,
                            were waved ; while from others, and from the door-ways of doggeries, the
                            scowling faces of secessionists shot forth black looks of mingled hate
                            and fear.</p>
                        <p>In camp the heat was great, but we had a glorious sea breeze. We also had
                            a few mosquitoes, but they were beneath contempt&#151;no more to be
                            compared to the fierce, remorseless insect of the South and West, than
                            was a kitten to a tiger, or a minnow to a whale. They were miserable,
                            feeble, attenuated insects, without power to injure or exasperate, and
                            our boys laughed at their puerile attempts to draw blood.</p>
                        <p>Toward the middle of August our regiment was considerably thinned out, by
                            detaching companies and squads for various duties. The companies of
                            Captains Skelton and McLaflin went to Fort McHenry, to take a course of
                            instruction in artillery practice, from Captain Hazard. Captain Roy's
                            company&#151;the "crack" one of the regiment, by the
                            by&#151;guarded the long bridge over the Patapsco, about a mile and
                            a half from camp. In addition to these, details of seventy men were sent
                            out every day or two, in charge of steamboats loaded with stores. The
                            boys who had been to Washington and back, had wonderful tales to tell of
                            the magnitude <pb id="VAA3891-198" n="193"/> of the preparations there
                            for the next forward movement.</p>
                        <p>An increased activity was perceptible in the work of preparing Fort
                            McHenry for reception of visitors, after the designs of the rebels with
                            regard to an invasion of Maryland was developed. The fort itself was an
                            open one, without casemates, but was considered impregnable, so far as
                            storming is concerned ; but there was a handsome spot of ground just
                            over the water, on the east or southeast, from which the place could
                            have been shelled effectively, provided a battery could have been
                            established there, which was hardly probable, unless it could have been
                            done between dark and daylight. The armament of the fort was considered
                            heavy. Tier upon tier of large guns rose above each other on the
                            parapets&#151;columbiads, howitzers, carronades, mortars,
                            etc.&#151;while shot, shell, grape and canister lay around loose in
                            convenient piles. There were several furnaces for heating shot. Three of
                            those terrible ten-inch columbiads, and several mortars commanded the
                            city of Baltimore. Fort McHenry, when the war commenced, was in very
                            poor condition, and would have fallen an easy prey to a vigorous attack,
                            but shortly after that event it was swiftly put in order and the
                            defenses greatly strengthened. But two companies of regulars were
                            quartered there. The Third New York&#151;a fine-looking,
                            well-drilled regiment, of two years' men&#151;was encamped on the
                            beach within the outer wall, and south of the fort.</p>
                        <p>Squads of prisoners were brought up every day or <pb id="VAA3891-199"
                                n="194"/> two, and treated to an indefinite seclusion within the
                            hospitable walls of McHenry. Thomas and Alexander were sent there, two
                            heroes of the St. Nicholas steamer affair&#151;the former on that
                            occasion having personated, with great success, the <hi rend="i"
                                >role</hi> of the "French Lady."</p>
                        <p>Thomas was a small, rather slender fellow, with a fresh, light
                            complexion, and the round oval face and bullet head, which seemed to be
                            the prevailing type among native Baltimoreans of the <hi rend="i">beau
                                monde.</hi> He and his pirate comrade were dressed in neat and
                            jaunty zouave costume, scrupulously clean, and spruce almost to
                            foppishness. They carried themselves bravely, without swagger or
                            bravado, and conversed freely with those around them.</p>
                        <p>In contrast to the appearance of Thomas and Alexander was that of Captain
                            Wellmore, another noted character in the purlieus of Baltimore. He was
                            arrested, put on parole, and swaggered about the streets in rebel
                            uniform, bloviating to such crowds as he could collect in grogshops. His
                            hair was red, profusely greased or soaped, and curled like a woman's.
                            His general appearance was that of a cross between a spooney and a petty
                            thief.</p>
                        <p>The view down the bay was one of quiet beauty. Some six or seven miles
                            off were seen the gray walls of Fort Carroll&#151;an unfinished
                            work&#151;rising out of the water. The bay was white with the sails
                            of ships bound out and in, coasting vessels and "pungey" boats crept
                            lazily along under the faintest suspicion of a breeze. At evening the
                            band of the New Yorkers over at the fort played the <pb id="VAA3891-200"
                                n="195"/> "Star-Spangled Banner" in fine style. It was quite a treat
                            to hear the glorious old air, whose every note quickens the blood and
                            awakens responsive echoes in the American heart&#151;played by a
                            good band, within a few hundred yards of the spot on which it was
                            composed. The ship from which Francis Key, himself a prisoner, in
                            heart-sickening suspense, witnessed the bombardment of Fort McHenry, and
                            amid the roar of bursting shells, the rocket's red glare, and the
                            screaming shot, composed the "Star-Spangled Banner," was anchored just
                            around the point, about a mile south-east of the fort. What a whirling
                            phantasm of changes since then, but the old flag is still seen "by the
                            dawn's early light," and by the purple beams of the setting sun, waving
                            proudly over the bristling ramparts of McHenry. So may it ever wave.</p>
                        <p>Not the least part of the philosophy which sustains the soldier in
                            privation and hardship is the ability to extract material for a laugh
                            out of the petty miseries and annoyances of camp life, and make the most
                            out of such ludicrous scenes as occasionally transpire. If there is any
                            thing in the adage "laugh and grow fat," the regiment was indebted to a
                            negro dress parade for many a layer of adipose matter over its
                            weather-beaten ribs. Among the herd of followers and hangers-on about
                            the camp, we had an unnumbered squad of colored gentry, the most of them
                            identified with the culinary department, with a number whose position
                            was not very well defined. These contrabands <pb id="VAA3891-201"
                                n="196"/> had become enthused with military ardor, and their dress
                            parade, which usually came off between twilight and dark in the rear of
                            the sutler's shanty, was a "big thing" in its way. The negro is an
                            imitative creature, and the way in which our field officers were "taken
                            off" was really laughable. Our colonel, who was a large, portly,
                            fine-looking man, occasionally, under the influence of strong
                            exasperation, broke out in a torrent of impolite words, swearing with a
                            vehemence and fluency that was rather astonishing. Adjutant Latham had a
                            peculiar way of stringing out the word "h-a-l-t" in cutting short a
                            badly executed evolution; the prolongation was indicative of rage,
                            astonishment and disgust. These and other peculiarities of the field
                            officers were reproduced in the negro dress parade with just a shade of
                            exaggeration. Some of the commands were rich. "Awdah&#151;arms!"
                            "Come to an awdah, men." "Report&#151;arms!"
                            "Percure&#151;arms!" "Charge&#151;baynets!" "Put yosef on a
                            charge, sahgent. Why de h&#151;ll don't you come to a charge?" These
                            parades were a little on the sly, and to disperse one it was only
                            necessary to hint that the adjutant was coming that way, when a panic,
                            equal to that of the "teamsters" at Bull's Run, swept away the black
                            cloud.</p>

                        <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> Baltimore secessionists were exceedingly restive
                            under the state of affairs that existed after the Government thrust its
                            meddlesome fingers into the pie of Marshal Kane and his Confederate
                            scoundrels. The pressure of Colonel Dix's rule was just heavy enough to
                            chafe and gall, without being sufficiently stringent to keep them still.
                            If any one doubted the existence of free speech in Baltimore, he should
                            have gone there, put on a Federal uniform, and walked through some of
                            the principal streets, when&#151;if he had eyes and ears&#151;he
                            would soon have been convinced that, by many of the good citizens of
                            that goodly city, "freedom of speech" was abused even to the uttermost
                            limits of licentiousness, and should have been held in check by a
                            liberal administration of Franklin's antidote, "Freedom of cudgel." It
                            required a fair proportion of German phlegm, considerable "cheek," and a
                            skin as thick as that of a rhinoseros to enable a Federal soldier,
                            officer or private, to walk the streets of Baltimore, and pass through
                            the ordeal with whole bones and an unruffled temper. Contemptuous looks,
                            insulting epithets, ribald jests, and vulgar impertinences, were
                            showered upon him in a profusion bordering upon prodigality, while
                            shouts for "Jeff" were frequent and loud. And for those insults there
                                <pb id="VAA3891-203" n="198"/> was no redress, and they could not be
                            resented, as that might bring on a "collision." When a soldier had
                            occasion to visit the city, if he obeyed the orders of Gen. Dix, he
                            trusted himself unarmed to the tender mercies of Baltimore
                            ruffians&#151;themselves armed to the teeth with the most approved
                            implements of throat-cutting and skull-splitting.</p>
                        <p>The ladies of Baltimore, like those of Washington, devoted heart and soul
                            to the interest of Secessia. Protected by their petticoats as well as by
                            the policy of General Dix&#151;a policy which bore about it a
                            pungent flavor of the powerful chemical compound known as the hydrate of
                            milk&#151;they were even more openly and brazenly insulting than the
                            men. Many of them who, from their appearance, seemed to be the <hi
                                rend="i">creme de la creme</hi> of the Baltimore <hi rend="i">beau
                                monde,</hi> appeared to be totally lost to all the impulses of
                            womanly modesty, or even common decency, which attributes seemed to have
                            given place to a fierce, blind, vindictive hatred, which would have
                            reveled in blood if it had only dared. The sight of a blue uniform had
                            the same effect upon them that scarlet has upon a bull or turkey-cock,
                            and they gathered up their rustling skirts as if fearful of
                            contamination, cocked their pretty noses in the air, tossed their heads
                            superciliously, and with a show of inexpressible disdain, passed on,
                            some dropping expressions, which, however suitable to the fish-market,
                            did not fall with good grace from the lips of a lady. What was a man to
                            do under such circumstances? Whip <pb id="VAA3891-204" n="199"/> the
                            first "secesher" he met, and been arrested by General Dix's police, or
                            should he have "grinned and borne it?" If the ladies had been ugly it
                            would not have been so bad, but, as the devil would have it, the ladies
                            of Baltimore are handsome, and the best looking seemed to be the most
                            inveterate haters of the government. The secessionists of Maryland were
                            evidently in expectation of something turning up shortly to favor their
                            schemes, as they had been daily growing more insufferably insolent in
                            their demeanor. What particular deviltry they had on foot at that time,
                            and whether their anticipations were ever realized, we were never fated
                            to learn.</p>
                        <p>The arrival of a detachment of prisoners from Western Virginia, on their
                            way to Old Point, from there to be sent to Norfolk, was made the
                            occasion of a sort of ovation by the Baltimore secessionists. The
                            prisoners were quartered at the Gilmor House, where they were visited by
                            large numbers of their friends, who presented them with new clothes and
                            money, and escorted them to the boat, followed by a miscellaneous
                            rabble, which shouted for Jeff Davis, and hooted and groaned at the
                            government. I happened to be in the city at the time, and the scene gave
                            me some faint idea of a Baltimore mob. The prisoners were mostly
                            Georgians, and one of them had lost a leg, and another an arm at the
                            battle of Rich Mountain, I believe. The one who had lost an arm was a
                            fine-looking, handsome fellow, apparently not more than 18 years old,
                            proud-spirited and haughty. He passed near where <pb id="VAA3891-205"
                                n="200"/> I was standing, with some others of the Twenty-first, and
                            recognizing the grey uniform, turned and said: "Indiana, I have seen <hi
                                rend="i">you</hi> fellows before."</p>
                        <p>I do not wish these denunciations of Baltimore people to be considered as
                            embracing all the population. On the contrary, the Union men were
                            generally as courteous, affable and hospitable as any I had ever met.
                            The city, in more than one characteristic, resembled that of Louisville,
                            in which there are some of the best, as well as some of the meanest
                            people in the world. The Government was not idle in view of the designs
                            of the Confederates upon Maryland, and the signs of a probable eruption
                            of the secession volcano in Baltimore. Fort McHenry had been put in the
                            best possible condition. Fort Carroll, in which at that period there
                            were no guns, soon received a heavy armament. Federal Hill&#151;the
                            spot upon which the constitution was ratified&#151;where the first
                            Federal flag was unfurled&#151;was strongly fortified, and a heavy
                            battery was erected in McKim's wood, back of that part of the city
                            called "Limerick."</p>
                        <p>The Twenty-first Indiana was then tolerably well drilled, and the boys
                            growled vehemently because they were not marched at once into Virginia.
                            They said they did not enlist to guard steamboats and bridges, but to
                            fight. The health of the regiment was good. Not a death occurred, (save
                            the occasional demise of a vagrant goose), and we had at no time more
                            than nine in hospital.</p>
                        <p>The regiment bore a fine reputation among the people on the Point, for
                            civility, morality, and the <pb id="VAA3891-206" n="201"/> observance of
                            the principles of <hi rend="i">meum</hi> and <hi rend="i">teum,</hi> as
                            compared with our predecessors in that locality, the Pennsylvania
                            regiment, of Colonel Miles. Mr. Brakeman, our chaplain, endeared himself
                            to us by his genial manner and kindly care for the temporal as well as
                            the spiritual wants of all. He was a minister of the old-fashioned
                            Methodist persuasion, and preached sound, practical sermons, without any
                            bias of sectarianism, every Sunday morning, with semi-weekly rations of
                            prayer-meeting. Captain Rose was also a Methodist preacher, and had an
                            effective hand in keeping up the interest of the meetings. Quite a
                            number of the regiment were professing Christians. I do not think there
                            was a man of any intelligence in the regiment, however wicked he might
                            have been himself, but said God-speed to the efforts of Chaplain
                            Brakeman.</p>
                        <p>One Sunday, as the sergeant major, O. P. Hervey, formerly editor of a
                            Noble county paper, was returning from a visit to Captain Roy's
                            encampment, he was greeted with a faint and tremulous shout for Jeff
                            Davis. The major, although unarmed, captured the rebel, and, under
                            threats of taking him to the fort, made him swear to support the
                            Constitution of the United States and of Indiana.</p>
                        <p>We had been at Camp Dix a full month before we could command suitable
                            hospital accommodations. And it was only after two good and brave men
                            (Thomas Benham and J. W. Dyke), who had left the comforts, the peace and
                            plenty of <pb id="VAA3891-207" n="202"/> home, for hardships and
                            privations in defense of their country's flag, had been sacrificed, that
                            the necessary arrangements could be effected with the circumlocution
                            office. We at last secured rooms in the St. Charles Hotel&#151;a
                            large, unoccupied building on Locust Point, near the Broadway
                            ferry-landing, where other lives were probably saved, though it was too
                            late for Dyke and Benham.</p>
                        <p>The famous cigar-ship, built by Ross Winans, laid over the way, about a
                            mile from camp. In company with a number of our officers, I had the
                            pleasure of going all over and through it. It was built entirely of
                            iron, the plates about an inch in thickness, and was, in fact, a hollow
                            iron tube, three hundred feet in length, sixteen in its greatest
                            diameter, and pointed very sharp at both ends. It was built in two
                            sections, with a wheel, twenty-six feet in diameter, revolving entirely
                            around the hull at the junction of the two sections, which was a little
                            forward of the center. The wheel worked upon the screw principle, and
                            somewhat resembled that of a wind-mill. The vessel had two rudders,
                            forward and aft, something like a spade in shape, only more so. The
                            appearance of the boat inside was by no means inviting. It was dirty and
                            hot, and going into it was a good deal like crawling into a hollow log.
                            The gentleman who had charge of the nondescript, informed us that it
                            could be turned completely around in a length and a half, and propelled
                            at the rate of twenty miles an hour. It might be capable of mischief in
                            running down vessels, <pb id="VAA3891-208" n="203"/> but could carry no
                            guns of any consequence. I understood that Mr. Winans had a model for
                            another steamer of the same kind, eight hundred feet long, with which he
                            proposed to cross the Atlantic in five days.</p>
                        <p>I made a visit to Captain Roy's camp, at the Long Bridge over the
                            Patapsco. Captain R., with half of his company, was stationed at the
                            Long Bridge, and the remainder at the Switzer bridge, three miles above.
                            These two bridges had been for a long time used as thoroughfares for the
                            conveyance of arms and ammunition from Baltimore to the secessionists of
                            Anne Arundel county, but the game was blocked so far as they were
                            concerned, as Captain Roy's men took special pains to see that nothing
                            contraband went that way. For the purpose of conveyance, I mounted a
                            famous grey horse belonging to the regiment&#151;a clever cross
                            between a camelopard and a rhinoceros&#151;and, sometimes trotting
                            with our fore-feet and galloping with those in the rear, and then again
                            enjoying the luxury of a graceful, undulating, side-wise shamble, we got
                            over the two intervening miles with no broken bones, but not without
                            terrible abrasions of the part in contact with the saddle. Captain Roy's
                            tents were pitched on a beautiful narrow strip of ground ornamented with
                            shade trees. On one side was the sheet of water, into which the Patapsco
                            emptied, and on the other a lovely lake, almost circular in form, called
                            Spring Garden Neck.</p>
                        <p>The Patapsco at Switzer Bridge degenerates <pb id="VAA3891-209" n="204"/>
                            into an insignificant creek, and I considered myself miserably swindled
                            in having been led to think it a river, by reason of its spread at the
                            mouth. On each side, the streamlet was lined with beautiful,
                            well-cultivated farms, with handsome dwellings, tall corn, worthy of an
                            Indiana prairie, and immense peach orchards, loaded with large, luscious
                            fruit. The most of the people were theoretical secessionists, but not at
                            all vicious. They readily confessed they were secessionists in
                            principle, but at the same time were social and hospitable, perfectly
                            satisfied to keep out of the fight, and follow their avocations in
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>There were probably some six or eight thousand troops in and around
                            Baltimore. They came and went so fast that it was impossible to make a
                            closer estimate.</p>

                            barrels, might have been serving one's country in some sense, but it did
                            not meet the preconceived notions of war entertained by our rough and

                            was favored with a fleeting and transitory glimpse of the elephant. But
                            we consoled ourselves with dismal lookings-forward to the good time
                            coming, and the hope that when there was real fighting to do, the
                            Twenty-first would not be overlooked when the tickets of invitation were
                            issued.</p>
                        <p>At this time Baltimore was in a state of ferment under the new and
                            somewhat vigorous exertions of Governor Dix to throttle the seditious
                            spirit in that rebellious city. The number of arrests made&#151;some
                            of them reaching persons of high standing <pb id="VAA3891-211" n="206"/>
                            in public and private life&#151;and the boldness and promptness of
                            the measures taken, rendered the rebels qualmish, and a long and loud
                            whine went up from the persecuted innocents because of the enormity of
                            suppressing secession badges, cheering Jeff Davis, and kindred harmless
                            manifestations of opinion. They who roared louder than all the bulls of
                            Bashan, and vapored like turkey-cocks, soon cooed as gently as a sucking
                            dove. Rebeldom was vociferous for peace. Red-handed, and with the steam
                            of the murders of the 19th of April rising from their smoking garments,
                            they prated of "peace." But they were not isolated in their efforts to
                            restore peace. Throughout the broad prairies of the West, and amid the
                            rocky hills of staid old New England, the piping cry of peace, and the
                            sophistry and cant accompanying it was the same that arose from the
                            peace-enamored scoundrels of blood-stained Baltimore. The similarity
                            between the peace talk of Vallan-digham, and others of that ilk, and the
                            secessionists of Maryland, was peculiarly suggestive.</p>
                        <p>A portion of the Maine regiment that was moved down to Potter's Hill,
                            just north of us, across the right arm of the Patapsco neck, threw up
                            extensive earth-works there, forming a portion of the very complete
                            fortifications that surrounded Baltimore, and made it appear so
                            threatening to J. Davis and Co., when they looked longingly towards that
                            fair city of down-trodden Maryland.</p>
                        <p>Heavy firing was heard for several days somewhere to the southward, and
                            we were annoyed <pb id="VAA3891-212" n="207"/> with all sorts of
                            vexatious rumors of impossible engagements at Munson's Hill and other
                            points, sanguinary beyond all precedent in character, and involving
                            mortality lists of enormous length; but our boys from being remarkably
                            credulous had passed through the various stages of skepticism until they
                            had gone into a chronic state of hopeless unbelief in everything which
                            did not transpire beneath their own immediate observation.</p>
                        <p>In conformity with General McClellan's orders, our troops shed the
                            greasy, dingy, shabby suit of Indiana grey, and donned the regulation
                            blue. It was a parting that entailed no regret, for we were heartly
                            disgusted with, and ashamed of, it. It was always being washed and
                            always dirty and greasy.</p>
                        <p>General Dix, anxious to know the facts in the case of the terrible affray
                            at Port Deposit, sent Major Hayes down there to investigate the matter,
                            and I accompanied him.</p>
                        <p>We left Baltimore at half past eight in the morning, and arrived in
                            Havre, twenty-eight miles distant, about half past ten. The road passed
                            through a poor agricultural country, much resembling, were it not for
                            the visible admixture of pine, cedar and chestnut, with the scrub oaks,
                            the "barren" regions of Indiana and South Illinois.</p>
                        <p>Havre de Grace is a quaint old town situated at the mouth of the
                            Susquehanna, forcibly reminding one of the sleepy Dutch burgs so
                            felicitously described by Washington Irving. Its slumberous appearance
                            was somewhat relieved by the fact of <pb id="VAA3891-213" n="208"/> a
                            part of the Fourth Regiment, New York Volunteers, being stationed
                            there.</p>
                        <p>Going down to the water to take the boat for Port Deposit, we passed a
                            member of the Fourth New York (Scott Life Guards), afflicted with a
                            chronic mania for desertion, in an uncomfortable position. He was lying
                            with his face in the sand, his arms thrown around a pillar supporting
                            the bridge, and heavily manacled. He was enjoying a profound slumber,
                            embellished with prolonged and sonorous snores.</p>
                        <p>The Fairy, a little side-wheel steamer, pointed sharp at both ends, was
                            waiting for us. First a detatchment of the guard went aboard, then the
                            prisoners filed in, then followed the rest of the guard, officers of the
                            Scott Life Guards, Mr. Meade Addison, U. S. District Attorney, Major
                            Hayes and myself, with a sprinkling of civilians bringing up the rear.
                            All aboard, and comfortably smoking under an awning on the upper deck, a
                            bell, large enough for the Great Eastern, rang furiously, and the Fairy
                            steamed away for Port Deposit, five miles above, on the Susquehanna.</p>
                        <p>Port Deposit was an old town then, consisting of one long and crooked
                            street built in the narrow space between the river and the bluff. Many
                            of the houses were large, heavy stone buildings, strong enough for
                            forts, and built of a beautiful, hard, grey granite, with which the
                            quarries in the neighboring bluffs abounded. Others were built of wood,
                            and plastered on the outside in a quaint, old-fashioned style. There was
                            a good deal of <pb id="VAA3891-214" n="209"/> wealth, and the town
                            formerly did a heavy business in grain, stone, lime, lumber and liquor.
                            It was then the head of navigation on the Susquehanna, and a great
                            forwarding point, but some public work&#151;the building of a road
                            or the cutting of a canal, I don't remember which&#151;nipped the
                            shoot of its rising greatness; since which time it has with difficulty
                            "held its own." The citizens were about equally divided between "Union"
                            and "Peace" (<hi rend="i">Anglice</hi> "Secesh"), and each party was
                            equally enthusiastic. A fine company of Home Guards was armed with
                            rifled muskets, and prepared at any moment to use them.</p>
                        <p>From a laborious examination before the jury of inquest, the following
                            particulars were gleaned of the collision: A "peace meeting" was being
                            held in the barber shop of a hotel, a number of soldiers of the Scott
                            Life Guard were in Port Deposit, and some eight or ten of them went into
                            the bar-room&#151;a secession house&#151;and drank at the bar.
                            Learning that a peace meeting was being held in the barber shop, the
                            door of which was open, two of them entered, and one of them waved a
                            small flag over the table where the votes were being counted, denounced
                            the meeting as a secession one, and declared his intention of breaking
                            it up. There were about fifty persons in the room, and they rose,
                            roughly expelled the soldiers, and followed them into the bar-room,
                            where a bloody and general fight ensued, in which fists, clubs, chairs,
                            spittoons and knives were freely used. After a time the fighting was
                            adjourned to the street, where the soldiers <pb id="VAA3891-215" n="210"
                            /> were chased with stones about fifty yards, when they rallied, and in
                            turn chased their pursuers. Two men were killed instantly in the
                            bar-room. They were both stabbed in the neck. Two citizens were also
                            stabbed, one in the face and arm, the other in the neck. Two or three
                            soldiers were stabbed, but not fatally, and others severely beaten, one
                            having the temporal bone on the left side of the face broken from a blow
                            with a spittoon. The scene in the bar-room was described as being
                            horrible in the extreme. The floor was literally drenched in blood. Men
                            lying dead, and soldiers scattered around, knocked senseless from
                            blows.</p>
                        <p>The evidence on the part of secession witnesses was so conflicting as to
                            destroy its credibility. Nothing was elicited to show that the soldiers
                            made a preconcerted attack on the meeting, or that there was a knife
                            among them. The presumption was that, after being beaten with chairs and
                            bludgeons, and some of them stabbed, one of them wrenched a knife from a
                            citizen's hand and used it with deadly effect. The two men killed were
                            both violent secessionists, one of them an estimable man, but hasty in
                            temper and frantic on the secession question. The other was a man of
                            violent habits, and had been frequently engaged in stabbing affrays. A
                            witness of undoubted veracity, who viewed the fight through a broken
                            pane in a window, and who gave his evidence in a clear and
                            circumstantial manner, testified that he saw the latter with a soldier's
                            head jammed down over the counter and repeatedly striking him with a
                            club. <pb id="VAA3891-216" n="211"/> All the witnesses testified to the
                            quiet and gentlemanly deportment of the soldiers up to the time of their
                            interruption of the meeting. The jury returned a verdict which did not
                            implicate the soldiers any more than the citizens.</p>
                        <p>At Perryville, opposite Havre de Grace, a great mule and wagon depot had
                            been established. The American flag at that point waved in triumph over
                            six thousand mules and three thousand wagons, with fresh arrivals every
                            day. A thick, heavy cloud of dust hovered over the region round about,
                            and the air was resonant with multitudinous brays, intermingled with the
                            hoarse cries of the mule-breaker.</p>
                        <p>Returning down from Port Deposit by the river road, we came upon a vast
                                <hi rend="i">corral</hi> of United States wagons, inclosing a space
                            of five or six acres. Inside the inclosure a perfect forest of long
                            ears, and a compact mass of black hides were working and surging to and
                            fro. There were quite a number of these pens near Perryville, each
                            containing fifteen hundred or two thousand mules, collected from all
                            parts of the country, and stored in those pens to await the process of
                            breaking.</p>
                        <p>Some distance from the pen we found the breaking-ground, where about a
                            hundred lusty darkies were engaged in the work of taking the mules
                            through a rudimentary course of instruction preparatory to fitting them
                            for duty in harness. The process of breaking was exciting and
                            interesting, and not unattended with danger. The mule was driven into a
                            "chute" just the width of his body, <pb id="VAA3891-217" n="212"/> with
                            strong wooden bars on each side, which prevented his kicking out
                            laterally, and at the same time admitted of his being handled through
                            the cracks. A rope was then fastened to his jaw, and another tied as a
                            girth around his barrel; after which one was attached to his fore-feet
                            and passed under the girth and out at the rear, in which condition he
                            was turned out for the preliminary exercises, consisting of a series of
                            frantic plunges, with some ludicrous ground and lofty tumbling and
                            vicious attempts to bite and strike with his forefeet. This exercise
                            continued for a longer or shorter period of time, according to the
                            intelligence and obstinacy of the subject. But your mule is not
                            altogether such a fool as he looks, and after coming to grief a matter
                            of a dozen times by means of the check rope, he wisely concluded that
                            plunging and rearing was not remunerative, and lay still, either
                            reflecting or groaning piteously. If unusually obstinate through the
                            first lesson, he was trotted around the course at a double quick and his
                            hide copiously anointed with a stout cudgel.</p>
                        <p>After the first course, the mule being supposed to have absorbed
                            something of the rudiments of his education, was reconducted to the
                            "chute," where he was invested with harness and again led forth, and
                            another series of gymnastic exercises took place.</p>
                        <p>After becoming somewhat accustomed to the harness, they were hitched up
                            to the large wagons and driven around the course. The operation of
                            hitching up was a delicate one, requiring great <pb id="VAA3891-218"
                                n="213"/> care. The negro approached cautiously and gingerly, with
                            his eye fixed on the mule's ears. If a suspicious movement of the
                            auricular appendages was seen, the startled African sprang backward
                            quick as lightning, just in time to escape a flashing pair of heels.
                            Again he approached, and finally succeeded in hitching up. A brace of
                            broken mules were usually put in the rear, with a team of wild ones in
                            front.</p>
                        <p>When the mule is shod, a broad leather belt is passed around his body and
                            he is hoisted clear, then his feet are drawn back and fastened, when he
                            helplessly submits to the operation of shoeing, emitting sundry protests
                            in the way of snorts and groans.</p>
                        <p>When curried, it is an operation which hardly pays for the danger
                            incurred. The mule is altogether too handy with his heels to render it
                            desirable employment. Sometimes a curry comb is fastened to an
                            eight-foot pole, when the groom stands out of range and rakes him down
                            from "long taw."</p>
                        <p>Negroes were exclusively employed in the breaking and training of mules
                            at Perryville. I asked one of the men superintending the matter why this
                            was so. "Well," said he, "a negro is the next thing to a mule, anyhow.
                            They understand each other better, and there is a natural affinity of
                            character between them. The negroes like it, and d&#151;d if I don't
                            believe the mules like it too. At any rate, a negro can break a mule
                            twice as quickly as a white man, and can get more out of him after <pb
                                id="VAA3891-219" n="214"/> he is broken. We tried white men, but it
                            wouldn't do. The mules have no confidence in them."</p>
                        <p>A great many people wondered why General McClellan did not make a forward
                            movement. If they had gone to Perryville and seen the vast pens of mule
                            flesh, the wagons, the stores of forage, forges, harness and equipments,
                            they would have known what he was waiting for.</p>

                        <p>W<hi rend="sc">E</hi> moved our camp from Locust Point up to the
                            neighborhood of Druid Hill Park, a beautiful location, with a fine shade
                            of oak and sweet gum trees, high and rolling, and excellent spring
                            water. Our camp was now called Camp Murray. We anticipated a great deal
                            of benefit, in the sanitary way, from the change. Notwithstanding the
                            opinion of some, I do not believe that dirt is the cause of the greater
                            part of camp sickness. At Locust Point, our boys were regularly driven
                            to the water and washed, like sheep, and yet intermittent, typhoid, and
                            vile, low-grade fevers, for which there is no name, but resembling the
                            Southern "dengue" or "break-bone," prevailed.</p>
                        <p>September 26th, 1861, was pretty generally observed by the citizens of
                            Baltimore as a day of fasting, humiliation and prayer&#151;the
                            Baltimoreans fasted on oysters and cocktails, preyed promiscuously <pb
                                id="VAA3891-220" n="215"/> upon each other, and "humiliated"
                            themselves by pious pilgrimages behind 2:40 horses to Druid Hill Park,
                            or sailed leisurely down the Bay, and drew miniature leviathans from the
                            "vasty deep" with a hook. Business houses, Union and Secession, were
                            alike closed, and the city had a sort of holiday appearance. The
                            churches were crowded, and the Throne of Grace besieged, with petitions
                            and counter petitions, from different members of the same church,
                            praying to the same God, that events widely apart might come to
                            pass.</p>
                        <p>Throngs of citizens visited the various military encampments about the
                            city; our own (which at Locust Point was rarely brightened with visitors
                            of the female persuasion, apple women and negroes excepted,) came in for
                            a full share. The Maryland regiment, at Camp Carroll, and the Sixth
                            Michigan, in camp at Prospect Hill, on the York road, had flag
                            presentations, at which the usual ceremonies were observed and the usual
                            patriotic speeches, abounding in valorous war-talk, couched in
                            prettily-worded, smoothly-turned sentences, were made. This was a thing
                            we were heartily tired of. We had seen enough of the flummery of war,
                            and now wanted the reality. Speeches were well enough to amuse women,
                            children and "sweet young men" whose business interests were such that
                            they could not leave home, but we wanted to hear the cannon's roar.</p>
                        <p>Our boys were highly pleased with their new camp and we indignant that
                            they should have been kept so long at Locust Point, when this beautiful
                                <pb id="VAA3891-221" n="216"/> spot was unoccupied. We had been so
                            long on the barren sand of Camp Dix that the very sight of a tree was
                            exhilarating. The site of our camp was covered with fine old oaks and
                            sweet gums. One venerable fellow, which had probably outlived more
                            tempests than there were acorns on its branches, struck its gnarled
                            roots into the earth just in front of our tent, and spread its
                            protecting arms in a patronizing way over us. A swarm of insects of the
                                <hi rend="i">cicada</hi> tribe rendezvoused in its branches; the
                            cheerful music of their prattling gossip proclaimed some naughty things
                            which Katy-did.</p>
                        <p>We formed a much better opinion of the sociability of Baltimore people
                            after we came to Camp Murray. Throngs of them came to see our dress
                            parades, on foot and in carriages, and handsomely dressed lady
                            equestrians, who rode and looked charmingly, favored us with their
                            presence. Our colonel was the recipient of so many testimonials of good
                            will from the female portion of our visitors, in the shape of tastefully
                            arranged bouquets, that there was danger of his becoming a little
                            vain.</p>
                        <p>Our camp was named after the gentleman who owned the ground, to whom we
                            were indebted for many favors.</p>
                        <p>Every day rumors of terrible fighting along the Potomac reached the city,
                            and finally floated out to camp, magnified and distorted in all possible
                            shapes of absurdity, but they failed to excite attention. The fact was,
                            we had made up our minds to go into winter quarters in Baltimore, and
                            had turned our attention to base-ball&#151;the enjoyments <pb
                                id="VAA3891-222" n="217"/> of the creature comforts, and the
                            cultivation of female society, neither knowing nor caring whether
                            Beauregard was to winter in Philadelphia, or McClellan in Richmond. We
                            had waited and watched and prayed for active service through the various
                            stages of sanguine hope to despair, which was finally ended in
                            indifference, until we were prepared to fall in with any fly-blown
                            policy the government might choose to pursue. If we must go into winter
                            quarters in the North, I did not know any better place than Baltimore,
                            where we were well fed and comfortably housed. The colonel, however, was
                            resolved to make one last effort to get in the field before the winter
                            set in.</p>
                        <p>Our regiment had cast its greasy shell of Indiana grey and bloomed in
                            regulation blue. The change for the better in the appearance of the men
                            was almost incredible. They looked like different men altogether, and
                            compared favorably in personal appearance and proficiency with anybody's
                            regiment. Indeed, I think I might hazard the assertion that we had the
                            best drilled, best equipped, best fed and best looking regiment that had
                            yet left the State. We had exchanged the old muskets received at
                            Indianapolis for German rifles&#151;<hi rend="i">chef d' auvres</hi>
                            of Dutch ingenuity in the way of clumsiness of exterior, but of
                            exquisite finish of the interior, and good range. The two flank
                            companies kept their Enfield rifles, which after all were the deadliest
                            weapons in the hands of men who knew how to use them. The nipping cold
                            of the nights was a disagreeable hint of the near approach of winter.
                                <pb id="VAA3891-223" n="218"/> The woods were glorious with the
                            gorgeous hues of the dying autumn&#151;the green and golden of the
                            maple, the crimson of the gum and sumach, and the sombre brown of the
                            oak. The dropping nuts, the leaden sky, the wailing breeze crooning a
                            requiem among the branches of the oaks for the departed glories of the
                            summer, all reminded us that the "melancholy days had come," and
                            engendered lugubrious cogitations on the budding hope and blasted fruits
                            of man's ambition.</p>
                        <p>Almost a year had elapsed since this rebellion, so long brewing, had
                            broken out with the secession of South Carolina. Armies, vaster in
                            proportion and more terrible in equipment than any the world had seen
                            since the days of the great Napoleon, had sprung full-armed into
                            existence, while a mighty government convulsed the world with its
                            struggles to maintain itself, and the tread of armed men resounded from
                            Maine to California. How well did we remember the jests and sneers of
                            the arrogant and self-sufficient North at the rebellion when it first
                            broke out. We roared and shook our sides with merriment, and fired
                            broadsides of epigrams at the rebels while they worked, drilled, stole
                            guns and built batteries. The joke was too good&#151;we must humor
                            it. Then Sumter fell, and the North exploded in an unaccountable rage.
                            That which was known must finally take place&#151;that which had
                            been calmly and quietly contemplated for months&#151;set the entire
                            North in a blaze. Then all the talk was for "crushing out" the
                            rebellion&#151;for sweeping the last vestige of treason from the
                            land, and <pb id="VAA3891-224" n="219"/> hanging the arch-traitors; but
                            gradually and surely the ugly fact dawned upon us that treason was not
                            to be crushed out with words; that the misguided traitors were terribly
                            in earnest, and had avoided the error which had so nearly proved fatal
                            to us&#151;of under-rating the magnitude of the task before them.
                            Bull Run was a gentle reminder that undisciplined masses, however brave,
                            could not march uninterruptedly "on to Richmond;" that self-confidence
                            was not a match for superior generalship, nor a substitute for
                            discipline; that to despise an enemy was not to conquer him. But still
                            we found a general disposition among the people at large of the North to
                            under-rate the strength and energy of the rebels. People whose
                            "business" would not permit them to enlist, continued to talk in a
                            loose, rambling way of "crushing out" the rebellion, while the God's
                            truth was that from the first the rebellion had steadily and
                            persistently gained ground and was more formidable than it ever had
                            been.</p>
                        <p>I had not the slightest doubt of the ultimate triumph of the Government,
                            but that triumph must be the result of earnest work and hard fighting,
                            and not the frothing talk of fools and bigots. I know the temper of
                            these Southerners too well to flatter myself, that even the defeat and
                            utter destruction of their army in Virginia, would end the war. Rumor
                            had it that we were to leave here immediately. As for myself, I was
                            prepared to hybernate for the winter. Our household consisted <pb
                                id="VAA3891-225" n="220"/> of myself and comrade, a bench-leg dog
                            and a cat of great blackness.</p>
                        <p>The health of the regiment was good; most all the cases in the hospital
                            when we left Locust: Point, had got out, and no new ones had been sent
                            from Druid Hill.</p>

                        <p>W<hi rend="sc">E</hi> again removed our camp, and were located just
                            outside of the fortifications on Murray Hill, Snake Hill, or Potter's
                            Hill, as the place was variiously designated, on the ground just vacated
                            by the Tenth Maine, which left for the Potomac the day we came down.
                            Murray Hill was in the immediate vicinity of Canton. Canton was a
                            bad-smelling suburb of Baltimore, consisting principally of ragged cuts
                            and holes in the ground, fringed around the edges with dingy houses,
                            sheltering a mingled population of Dutch, Irish and negroes, the most of
                            them identified with beer and laundry interests. Flocks of straggling
                            geese and herds of savory goats lent to the place a pastoral appearance,
                            and mangy, ill-looking, half-starved curs sniffed suspiciously at the
                            heels of the pedestrian.</p>
                        <p>Discharges had been made out and forwarded to the war department for
                            fifty or sixty of our men. A great many of those were cases which a
                            rigid inspection at the time of enlistment would have rejected. The
                            necessity for a closer inspection of <pb id="VAA3891-226" n="221"/>
                            recruits should have been impressed upon colonels who were raising new
                            regiments. The enlistment of weak lungs and rheumatic temperaments was a
                            dead loss, and, in some sense, a fraud upon the government; besides, a
                            good deal of trouble in filling up might have been avoided by selecting
                            good men in the start. We were not likely to have any trouble in keeping
                            the regiment full, as new recruits came on from Indiana almost as fast
                            as there were vacancies.</p>
                        <p>The work on the fort was pushed on with vigor. The earth-works were
                            completed in a few days, and the guns mounted. The armament consisted of
                            thirty-eight guns, some of them of the heaviest calibre. The position
                            was a beautiful one, commanding the city, the harbor, and Fort McHenry.
                            The elevation was much above that of Fort McHenry, and greater than that
                            of Federal Hill. With these three powerful fortifications, Baltimore was
                            made rather hot to serve as winter quarters for Beauregard's army.</p>
                        <p>The general impression was that as soon as the works on Murray Hill were
                            completed, we would go into winter quarters inside the walls. There had
                            been loud and continued growling from the men at the policy of keeping
                            us here, while regiment after regiment of raw recruits, in a very
                            embryotic condition as regarded drill, and almost guiltless of
                            discipline, were forwarded to the theater of war; and the colonel, who,
                            having got his regiment into excellent fighting condition, was anxious
                            to give it an airing in the field, fumed and <pb id="VAA3891-227"
                                n="222"/> fretted as much as any of them. It was very gratifying to
                            be in high favor at headquarters, and we were very much obliged to Gen.
                            Dix for his excellent opinion of us, but we could dispense with a
                            portion of it, for the consideration of being taken into service.</p>
                        <p>The weary monotony of camp life was right sharply relieved by a variety
                            of "moving incidents, by flood and field"&#151;mostly flood. For
                            twenty-four hours the wind blew a terrible gale, and the rain fell in
                            torrents, spiced with occasional "spurts" of sleet and hail. Flies were
                            carried away, guy-ropes snapped, and in some instances, tents were
                            lifted bodily from the ground, and the shivering inmates exposed to a
                            "pitiless pelting." Our camp was left in an interesting condition. A
                            hundred little torrents, thick with red earth washed from the walls of
                            the fort, poured through the streets and into the tents, forming little
                            ponds in all the basins and drowning out the camp-fires. The earth was
                            tramped into a thin, slushy mortar, in which geese paddled and squawked
                            around, and the only two pigs I had seen since leaving Ohio, were
                            rooting.</p>
                        <p>The soldiers took advantage of a transitory gleam of sunshine, and
                            blankets, clothing, and other fixings were hung out in every available
                            spot. The boys came out strong under their trials, and were jolly as
                            even Mark Tapley could have wished under the only real hardships to
                            which they had been exposed, showing that however much they might growl
                            and grumble at trifles, when anything <pb id="VAA3891-228" n="223"/> was
                            to be endured, the responsibility of which could not be consistently
                            saddled upon the quartermaster, or their company officers, they had in
                            them the stuff to make soldiers. Men who would growl terribly at the
                            slightest symptom of acidity in bread, or the faintest suspicion of
                            rustiness in bacon, whom nothing less than "iced water and milk" in
                            summer, and hot rolls and butter in winter, would have
                            contented&#151;wet, cold, and hungry, sang songs in the mud, and
                            greeted each fresh mishap with roars of laughter. Not a few ludicrous
                            scenes might be recorded of the progress of the gale. About four o'clock
                            one Saturday morning the gallant captain of company A might have been
                            seen bracing his brawny shoulders resolutely against his tent poles,
                            with a brief shirt-tail flapping furiously in the breeze, and yelling
                            lustily for a somnolent Ethiope to come to the rescue. The captain was
                            in a quandary, the cold rain was beating in upon him, and if he let go
                            of the pole, his tent would be carried off bodily; if he held on to it,
                            he could not get to kill the negro. The captain was the prey for some
                            moments of conflicting passions&#151;solicitude for his quarters,
                            and rage at the profound slumber of his contraband&#151;but was
                            finally relieved, and escaped with an involuntary shower-bath.</p>
                        <p>The greatest solicitude was felt for the safety of the great fleet. It
                            was known that many of the vessels were not sea-worthy, and, heavily
                            laden as they were, if the gale was as severe on the coast as it was
                            with us, it was scarcely possible <pb id="VAA3891-229" n="224"/> they
                            could have escaped without serious disaster. Troops continued to pass
                            through almost daily, it was said, to Annapolis. The number in and about
                            Baltimore continued at about the same figures, in the neighborhood of
                            10,000. The Fourth Michigan Regiment remained at McKim's Wood, the Tenth
                            Maine at Patterson's Park, and the Duryea Zouaves at Federal Hill. The
                            Zoo-Zoos were brilliant with new red breeches of increased capacity in
                            the rear, and had lost none of their accustomed sauciness of
                            swagger.</p>
                        <p>The harbor was crowded with vessels which should be plying between
                            Baltimore and Washington. I was becoming more and more enamored of the
                            distinguished foresight and vigor with which the war was prosecuted. We
                            were scientific&#151;intensely so. We had balloons, and all the
                            latest improvements in rifled arms&#151;companies of sharpshooters,
                            carrying forty pound telescopic rifles, with which a man might be
                            "corpsed" at a greater distance than he could be distinguished with the
                            naked eye&#151;rocket batteries and Sawyer guns, to amuse scientific
                            generals with interesting sport "at the Rip-Raps," while the Potomac was
                            blockaded, and the food for our grand army was transported in wagons.
                            That was a good joke on science.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                        <p>E<hi rend="sc">ARLY</hi> in November a portion of the Twenty-first
                            succeeded in getting away from Baltimore, and into a region where there
                            was at least a prospect of a fight. For several days it had been noised
                            around the camp that an expedition of some sort was on foot, and on the
                            morning of the 12th we marched from our encampment, five hundred strong,
                            down to one of the Canton wharves, to await the movements of the steamer
                            which was to carry us off. About half-past 4 P. M., the Star came along,
                            and we went aboard. Presently the Pocahontas came up with five hundred
                            Zouaves on board, from Federal Hill, and in company we steamed off for
                            the Bay, the Pocahontas in the lead. On board the Star we passed a very
                            uncomfortable night. The boat was very much crowded, and without
                            accommodations of any kind for officer or private. It was really
                            distressing to see the frantic efforts of the poor fellows, who were
                            tired out with the preparations for the march, to get a little sleep.
                            Some of them coiled up in the most ridiculous positions imaginable. As
                            for myself, I was walked over some three or four hundred times, and my
                            ribs were sore from frequent punches from the feet of unconscious
                            sleepers&#151;said feet being spasmodically shot out at intervals,
                            in an involuntary <pb id="VAA3891-231" n="226"/> effort of the tired
                            muscles to secure a little respite from their unnatural tension.</p>
                        <p>About daylight we reached the mouth of the Potomac. After having passed
                            the light-house on Watts Island, and when in the neighborhood of Tangier
                            Sound, the Pocahontas ran aground, hard and fast.</p>
                        <p>We spent several hours in fruitless endeavors to haul her off, and then
                            steamed away for Pocomoke Sound, leaving the red breeches rueful and
                            disconsolate. But we had spent too much time with the Pocahontas. The
                            tide was out, and when near the mouth of Pocomoke river the Star
                            grounded on the mud bar, where we were compelled to lie until high tide.
                            We would have been in a very critical position provided the enemy had
                            had any artillery in the neighborhood. For nine hours we lay perfectly
                            helpless, within point-blank range of a portion of the sacred soil, with
                            the rebels reported in force within a short distance. Fortunately we
                            were not molested, and a little after 9 o'clock, crossed the bar and
                            entered the mouth of the Pocomoke, where there was plenty of water for
                            the largest vessels.</p>
                        <p>The Pocomoke must be seen to be appreciated. No description could do
                            justice to its beauties. It is a narrow, crooked stream&#151;not
                            wider than a creek&#151;with low, marshy banks, and water as black
                            as ink. There was apparently no current in it, except that caused by the
                            ebb and flow of the tide. There was some dry land between the mouth and
                            Newtown, a distance of twenty miles, <pb id="VAA3891-232" n="227"/> but
                            the most of the country immediately adjacent to the river was cypress
                            swamp. The person who has never seen a cypress swamp has one nameless
                            horror yet to experience. The dismal cypress trees, festooned with
                            poisonous vines&#151;the queer-looking cypress "knees" shooting up
                            in myriads around the roots of the trees; the filthy marsh, "where the
                            serpent feeds," and the stagnant water, with its load of
                            miasma&#151;formed a picture not easily forgotten.</p>
                        <p>We had been led to expect trouble in ascending the Pocomoke, as it was
                            reported that batteries had been built along its bank, between the mouth
                            and Newtown. In expectation of being fired upon, Colonel McMillan formed
                            his men on the upper and lower decks of the boat, in the best manner
                            possible, and we cautiously steamed up. One after another we passed the
                            points at which the batteries had been appointed, without interruption,
                            and reached Newtown in due season. We ran up to a little dirty wharf,
                            alongside of which a few shabby lumber schooners were moored. The banks
                            were lined with a crowd of negroes of all sizes, ages and sexes, whose
                            staring eyes were almost popping out of their heads with amazement, and
                            their teeth chattering with terror. The boat having been moored, the
                            vanguard of the Grand Army of the Potomac marched ashore, and bivouacked
                            in an open lot, close to a little snuff-colored Catholic church, with a
                            funny cupola and steeple, and a graveyard in the rear. With exception of
                            the negroes, and an occasional glimpse of a pair of bright <pb
                                id="VAA3891-233" n="228"/> eyes, and part of a figure all in white
                            peeping out from behind the window curtains, we saw no signs of life
                            about Newtown at that time. It was a little place, of about 800
                            inhabitants. They called it Newtown because it was so old. The
                            population seemed to be mainly composed of colored people and
                            women&#151;the presumption being that most of the men are skulking
                            in the woods, or in the rebel army.</p>
                        <p>The day after we arrived there, Colonel Payne's Wisconsin regiment came
                            down from Snow Hill, and encamped alongside of us. Our Zouave friends
                            also came in on the Star. Nem's battery of Massachusets flying
                            artillery, Captain Richard's Pennsylvania dragoons, and a detachment of
                            Delaware men, also came in.</p>
                        <p>General Lockwood was in command of the troops. He was a Delaware man, of
                            whom I knew nothing. His force was about 3,500, including the troops I
                            have mentioned. The Purnell Legion of Maryland troops encamped over the
                            river near there, with some Eastern Shore men, whose position or
                            strength I was unable to ascertain.</p>
                        <p>It rained constantly all night, and as we were encamped on low ground and
                            not particularly well provided for, it may be imagined that our position
                            was not a pleasant one, but I never saw any troops more eager for a
                            fight than those of the Twenty-first. We were commanded by Colonel
                            McMillan in person, who proved himself a thorough officer, and fully
                            equal to any position in which he might be <pb id="VAA3891-234" n="229"
                            /> placed. Our excellent adjutant, Mat. Latham, was also with us. On the
                            map is a narrow peninsula, about ninty miles in length, lying between
                            the bay and the ocean, which was geographically a part of Maryland, but
                            had always belonged to Virginia. Of this peninsula was formed the two
                            counties of Accomac and Northampton. It was reported that General
                            Magruder had entrenched himself in Accomac county, with 4,000 or 5,000
                            men, a short distance from us, and our expedition was to "clean out" the
                            two Virginia counties entirely. Everything indicated that an engagement
                            was expected, and probably a bloody one; for myself I did not anticipate
                            any fight. And when the magnificent bubble of the peninsula war was
                            pricked, very little survived the collapse. We came out from Baltimore
                            prepared for a vigorous and effective campaign, with infantry, cavalry,
                            artillery, ambulances, surgeons and lint. The most exaggerated stories
                            of the force and formidable preparations of the rebels were circulated,
                            and many thought it possible that there might be a fight, in view of the
                            extensive preparations made.</p>
                        <p>The entire force under the command of Gen. Lockwood, amounted to near
                            five thousand men. That of the enemy, as near as it could be
                            ascertained, was about seven hundred! When our boys learned that all
                            this preparation was made to attack seven hundred undisciplined men,
                            armed with shot-guns and squirrel rifles, their rage and disgust was
                            unutterable. All we did was to devour our chagrin and leave Newtown. We
                            took up our line <pb id="VAA3891-235" n="230"/> of march southward. The
                            troops that left New town, were nine hundred Wisconsin, five hundred
                            Zouaves, five hundred Michigan, and five hundred Twenty-first Indiana,
                            together with Nim's Flying Artillery and Capt. Richards' Pennsylvania
                            cavalry, each one hundred and fifty strong. We crossed the Maryland line
                            about six miles from Newtown, and for the first time set foot on the
                            sacred soil of Virginia. It was the first time our men had had an
                            opportunity of trying the realities of a march, and the most of them
                            thought there was no fun in trudging along a muddy road, with a forty
                            pound knapsack slung over the shoulder, nothing to eat but sheet-iron
                            crackers and raw bacon, with a handful of persimmons for dessert. After
                            several miles in Virginia, we came upon rebel "sign" in the shape of
                            large numbers of trees cut across the road. In the innocence of their
                            hearts they supposed we would turn back when we came to this fallen
                            timber; but not a bit of it! A few miles further on we arrived at the
                            rebel fort&#151;a rude breastwork, forming a half-circle, with a
                            deep ditch around it, and embrasures for mounting three or four guns. It
                            was so poorly constructed, that even if properly manned, it would have
                            been worse than useless. There was not room in the embrasures to work
                            the guns, and nothing to prevent its being stormed in the rear. The
                            rebels had evacuated, and had left in hot haste for the South.</p>
                        <p>We passed this fort, which our adjutant christened <pb id="VAA3891-236"
                                n="231"/> the "Rebel's Folly," and came on to Oak Hill, two or three
                            miles further, and encamped.</p>
                        <p>Our commissariat had been very poorly provided. We had had nothing to eat
                            since leaving Baltimore but bacon and hard bread; and the worst feature
                            was, there was not enough of that. Our colonel made most vigorous
                            efforts to keep the men from stealing; but it could not be expected that
                            soldiers would starve, or even go very hungry in the enemy's country,
                            and the tents had scarcely been pitched an hour before chickens were
                            squawking and pigs squealing in every direction. There was miserable
                            mismanagement somewhere. Capt. Richards' cavalry had had no tents since
                            leaving Baltimore, and nothing whatever to eat except a little hard
                            bread they had brought in their haversacks. The country was much better
                            than I expected to see, taking Newtown as a specimen. It was a pine
                            country, with light, sandy soil, which produced tolerably fair wheat and
                            corn, with the aid of guano. The persimmon grew exuberantly; and, as a
                            consequence, the oppossum flourished and waxed fat. Everything that came
                            into camp was "possum," but I never before knew the animal wore feathers
                            and hoofs!</p>
                        <p>The negro also abounded to a considerable extent. Their ivories glistened
                            on every side, and their broad, greasy faces were radiant with
                            good-humored smiles. Indeed, they were much more pleased to see us than
                            were the white inhabitants. The latter were a slow set. A newspaper
                            never found its way there, unless by accident, and the <pb
                                id="VAA3891-237" n="232"/> people were almost wholly ignorant of
                            what transpired in the outside world. I found few who had heard of the
                            sailing of the great fleet, and some who had just heard of Bull Run.
                            They were not at all curious. They asked no questions. They knew nothing
                            and did not want to know anything. Such of them as pretended to know
                            what was going on, had heard only the secession version of the various
                            incidents of the war.</p>
                        <p>Their country had made enough bread and meat to live on, but there was no
                            money there, and no commerce of any kind. The people had been so
                            situated they could get nothing from either the North or South. The only
                            port of entry on the peninsula had been abolished, and the Confederates
                            had established none.</p>
                        <p>We found an old 32-pounder of French or Spanish manufacture there, said
                            to have been dug up in one of the marshes on the sea coast. They need
                            not have gone to the trouble of spiking it, as it was so eaten with rust
                            as to be worthless.</p>
                        <p>A horrible accident occurred in the Sixth Michigan encampment. A soldier,
                            carelessly handling a gun, discharged it and blew off a comrade's
                            head.</p>

                        <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> Twenty-first and the Zouaves reached Eastville,
                            Northampton county, Virginia, on the 23d of November, having marched
                            through the entire peninsula without so much as seeing even the tail <pb
                                id="VAA3891-238" n="233"/> of a foe in arms. We saw plenty of "sign"
                            in the shape of rudely-constructed breastworks, fallen timber, cut
                            across the roads to embarrass our march, and the sites of rebel
                            encampments, abandoned in hot haste; but the expedition was perfectly
                            barren of actual fighting, and its only trophies were eight or ten field
                            pieces, well mounted, and several hundred assorted
                            muskets&#151;flint locks, percussion locks, and without
                            locks&#151;knapsacks, cartridge boxes, and outlandish old
                            sabers.</p>
                        <p>Adjutant Latham, with a squad of Richards' cavalry, were quite successful
                            in hunting up secreted arms, besides they made several, important
                            arrests&#151;among others, those of Colonel and Captain West and
                            Lieutenant Bull. Colonel West was the commander-in-chief of the rebel
                            militia in the counties of Accomac and Northampton, while the regular
                            confederates were commanded by General Charley Smith, a young man about
                            twenty-three of age, and a relative of "Extra Billy."</p>
                        <p>The rebels had all dispersed or escaped from the country. It was
                            astonishing to see the number of good Union men. Nearly everybody was
                            for the Union&#151;just then&#151;and those who could not deny
                            having been in the rebel ranks, were "pressed" into the service. It was
                            a little singular how, with so many Union men in the peninsula, they
                            could have allowed themselves to be forced into a service repugnant to
                            them; but, perhaps, it was one of the anomalies of war.</p>
                        <p>Eastville was a town of about one hundred and fifty
                            inhabitants&#151;four miles from any steamboat <pb id="VAA3891-239"
                                n="234"/> landing, and eight miles from Cherry-Stone wharf, the old
                            Norfolk boat landing. It was only forty miles from there to Norfolk. The
                            peninsula is very narrow there, and one could go but a short distance
                            from the town on either side, without encountering some of the numerous
                            inlets from the bay or sea. The finest oysters were found on both the
                            bay and seaside. The country about there presented the same appearance
                            as at all other points along the road&#151;flat and level, with
                            light, sandy soil, and forests of pine, with oak and holly intermixed.
                            About our encampment, which was in a thick pine wood, northwest of the
                            town, I found thin specimens of the Spanish moss hanging from some of
                            the trees, and several specimens of a variety of the
                            magnolia&#151;indications of a southern latitude.</p>
                        <p>In the clerk's office at Eastville, I found judicial records showing a
                            county organization as far back as 1632. This is the country where they
                            ordered a witch to be publicly ducked three times in fifteen
                            minutes.</p>
                        <p>Nothing particularly exciting occurred on the march from Oak Hill to this
                            place. The men had given up all hopes of a fight, and after having, to
                            some extent, recovered from their rage at being so completely
                            fooled&#151;their exasperation in some instances amounting to that
                            highest degree of indignation known as "bull mad"&#151;turned their
                            attention to extracting as much fun from the incidents of their
                            wearisome march as was practicable. They took particular delight in
                            devilling the darkies <pb id="VAA3891-240" n="235"/> along the route.
                            These persons appeared to be as well posted as their masters, with
                            regard to our coming, and were very much crest-fallen when they found we
                            did not set them free, as they had been led to expect. Some of them had
                            their bundles ready packed, expecting to be taken along. At one place,
                            while coming through a wood this side of Drummond Town, the column was
                            startled by the sudden apparition of an old white-headed negress by the
                            road-side, throwing up her hands, and thanking God vehemently that we
                            had come at last. She said she had prayed for our coming long, and her
                            prayers were at length answered. The boys gave a deafening cheer, and
                            marched on, leaving the poor creature mystified and forlorn.</p>
                        <p>At Modest Town and Whitestown we found small editions of the American
                            flag, which were greeted with hearty cheers. These flags had only been
                            displayed the morning we came along, and probably were run up to save
                            their property from the pillage, which the ignorant inhabitants had been
                            taught to expect. At Whitestown we found a supply of tobacco, the
                            scarcity of which had been the cause of much distress. The entire stock
                            of the shopkeeper was purchased by those who had money and divided among
                            their comrades, the boys declaring that their knapsacks felt much
                            lighter, and the blisters on their feet did not hurt half so badly with
                            a quid of the weed between their jaws.</p>
                        <p>They classified farmers among the poorer classes of the peninsula
                            according to the number of horses; they worked. There was the one-horse
                            farmer, <pb id="VAA3891-241" n="236"/> the two and the three-horse
                            farmer, and a man who worked five horses was a "right-smart" farmer.
                            They planted their corn&#151;one stalk in the hill&#151;and it
                            grew close to the ground, with one ear to the stalk. They knew nothing
                            about acres, but any one could tell you how many thousand hills of corn
                            he had raised.</p>
                        <p>The oxen of the peninsula were miserably small and mean looking. They
                            worked them singly in shafts, the load being pushed along by the head.
                            One of them, if properly fattened, might make a meal for a hungry
                            Hoosier, but I would not give a "claco" for the fragments.</p>
                        <p>We left Oak Hill in the evening and marched some six or eight miles
                            before camping. The Zouaves were in the lead, and having marched in
                            pretty quick time, they took up an idea they were "putting the Hoosiers
                            through"&#151;an idea that seemed to tickle them amazingly. The next
                            day, however, we were in the lead, and concluded to give our red
                            brethren a taste of Hoosier traveling. We marched fifteen miles in five
                            hours, through sand shoe-mouth deep, and stopped for dinner a short
                            distance this side of Drummond Town. The Zouaves were strung along the
                            road for two miles back, and came straggling in, crestfallen and
                            disgusted, for half an hour after. On the afternoon's march their
                            surgeon rode up and begged Col. McMillan for God's sake to halt; saying
                            that his men could not possibly stand it.</p>
                        <p>The peninsula, cut off from commerce in a great measure, with both the
                            North and South, <pb id="VAA3891-242" n="237"/> had suffered for many
                            articles of domestic comfort. Sugar, coffee, stationery, and even the
                            necessaries of peninsular life&#151;rum and tobacco&#151;were
                            remarkably scarce, the two latter being parted with reluctantly at
                            exorbitant prices.</p>
                        <p>No want was more seriously felt by our little army than that of a regular
                            communication with the outside world. We saw nothing and heard nothing
                            except at rare intervals. One day, by a singular streak of good luck, I
                            got hold of a Philadelphia paper only five days old. What a scramble
                            then ensued for the second, third, and as high as the fortieth reading.
                            Our little expedition was made to cut a big figure in the papers. We
                            could appreciate the story of three hundred rebels laying down their
                            arms at Drummond Town, when we knew that we had not seen an armed rebel
                            on our march, and that at no time had there been more than a thousand
                            militia in all, in the two counties.</p>
                        <p>One could not but admire the sublime audacity of those peninsular rebels.
                            One day one of them came to our colonel with the modest request for a
                            squad of men to assist him in reclaiming a couple of dusky chattels who
                            had taken to the bush on the approach of our troops. In order to
                            understand the sublimity of his impudence, it is necessary to state that
                            these same chattels we were expected to hunt up were engaged, in working
                            upon one of those unique fortifications at Pongateague, and in felling
                            timber across the roads. It is matter of history, that the petitioner
                            left with a tickling in his ear, having received a piece of the
                            colonel's <pb id="VAA3891-243" n="238"/> mind, involving a pretty plain
                            statement of the case, embellished with some expressions more energetic
                            than polite.</p>
                        <p>The hearts of the hungry Twenty-first were gladdened by the arrival of a
                            provision train from Pongateague. It did not reach us any too soon, as
                            we had been for some days living on sweet potatoes, and tea made of
                            sassafras, dittany, spicewood, and such other fragrant roots and herbs
                            as we could gather in the woods. The sweet potato was an excellent thing
                            to have. The boys liked them, and for sixty or seventy consecutive meals
                            they made a good substitute for bread; but when it got to be a regular
                            thing, there were some unreasonable enough to growl. Those esculent, but
                            rather flatulent tubers grew in the greatest abundance on the peninsula,
                            and attained enormous size. They were cheap, too, retailing at
                            twenty-five cents a bushel.</p>
                        <p>The utmost carelessness characterized the management of our expedition
                            from the first. We left Newtown on very short allowance of
                            provisions&#151;crackers and bacon, and no coffee. Our progress
                            through the country was slow enough to give the rebels ample time to
                            secrete their arms and escape&#151;so that we captured comparatively
                            few munitions, and still fewer prisoners. Then the supply steamer was
                            sent to Pongateague Inlet, thirty-five miles from where we encamped, and
                            our food had to be hauled from there in wagons, when it might have been
                            landed at Cherrystone, twenty-seven miles nearer. To add to the
                            catalogue of blunders, <pb id="VAA3891-244" n="239"/> we were for days
                            without soap, and the men were alive with vermin. A man may think he
                            knows all about the hardships of a soldier's life, but he can have no
                            conception of it until he becomes food for smaller insects than himself.
                            The sickening disgust which creeps over a man who has been raised a
                            gentleman, causes him to loathe himself and his fellow man. Luckily,
                            soap came at last, and an energetic boiling and scrubbing was soon put
                            in progress.</p>
                        <p>In speaking of these matters I must exonerate our regimental officers
                            from blame. They did all that was in their power to render us
                            comfortable. "The king of France, with forty thousand men, marched up
                            the hill and then marched down again!" I am not sure it <hi rend="i"
                                >was</hi> the king of France, or being the king of France, <hi
                                rend="i">which</hi> king it was! But, at any rate, the somewhat
                            notable man&#156;uvre hinted at in the lines quoted, were cleverly
                            imitated by the performances of General Henry H. Lock-wood. Our
                            expedition was perfectly fruitless, so far as we could see, with the
                            exception of having been instrumental in scattering, temporarily, those
                            terrible seven hundred rebels, with their aforesaid dilapidated muskets
                            and shot-guns, and suspending for a time the completion of those
                            wonderful batteries we passed at various points on the route. Another
                            good accomplished, possibly, was the scattering of a little money among
                            the scaly rebels of the region, of which, God knows, they were sadly in
                            need.</p>
                        <p>Just before leaving for Baltimore, the camp of <pb id="VAA3891-245"
                                n="240"/> the Twenty-first Indiana was thrown into a state of
                            terrible excitement by a report that quite a number of men belonging to
                            Captain Richard Campbell's company, from Clay county, had been poisoned.
                            One of the "messes" of Capt. C's company purchased a "pone" of corn
                            bread from some one of the negro hucksters who thronged the camp with
                            pies, cakes, chickens, and other articles of country produce for sale.
                            They ate a small portion of the bread, but being called out for dress
                            parade, the remainder of the loaf was laid aside for future reference.
                            While on parade two of them were taken sick, and immediately after,
                            several others, with nausea and cramps in the stomach. All who ate of
                            the bread, seven in number, were similarly affected. Emetics were
                            promptly administered, and they were soon out of danger.</p>
                        <p>It did not seem that any mineral or other active poison was in the bread,
                            but certainly something got into it, whether by design or accident, that
                            made the boys sick for a time.</p>
                        <p>Quite a ludicrous scene transpired in the camp of the Michigan Sixth at
                            this time, in which our brigadier general played a prominent part. The
                            general was treating himself to an airing in his carriage, when he met a
                            soldier on the road with a decapitated turkey in his hand. The general
                            stopped him, inquired where he belonged, and was particularly anxious to
                            know all about the turkey. The soldier told him he had purchased it, and
                            the general drove off apparently satisfied; but the turkey lay heavily
                            on his mind. He could not imagine <pb id="VAA3891-246" n="241"/> how a
                            private could honestly possess a turkey; and if a soldier could so far
                            forget himself as to "purvey" a fowl of such magnificent dimensions,
                            especially while being furnished by the government with so rich a diet
                            as sweet potatoes, he ought to be made an example of. So the general
                            drove to the camp of the Michigan boys, having in the meantime worked
                            himself up into a furious rage, swearing that if found, the soldier
                            should be shot, and ordered an investigation. The companies were all
                            paraded, and the search began, the general making the rounds with the
                            company officers. The Michigan boys were stupefied with astonishment at
                            first, but finally the general was startled by the gobbling of a turkey
                            in his rear. He turned his head to look for the offender, when another
                            clever imitation of a turkey-cock was heard in front, and then a perfect
                            storm of turkey calls, cock-adoodle-doos, the hissing of geese, and
                            other specimen of barn-yard vocalism, broke out all over the camp. The
                            general beat a retreat, and on going out the gate, found a pole erected,
                            on which was conspicuously placed fifteen or twenty turkey, chicken and
                            geese heads.</p>

                        <p>E<hi rend="sc">ARLY</hi> in December, the Twenty-first Indiana returned
                            from the Eastern Shore expedition to Baltimore, having passed through
                            the many dangers and vicissitudes of that bloodless campaign without <pb
                                id="VAA3891-247" n="242"/> the loss of a single man! We marched
                            sixteen miles on the Pongateague road, then encamped in a pine wood with
                            our brethren of the gay and voluminous trowsers&#151;otherwise known
                            as Zouaves. Fuel was plenty, and by scraping together the fallen leaves,
                            we made beds, which for convenience were as good as any feathers that
                            ever grew on a grey goose's back. A slight fall of snow covered the
                            ground in the morning, giving things a winterish appearance. After
                            breakfast on the impossible cracker and the inevitable hog, we struck
                            tents once more, resumed our march for eight or ten miles, when we
                            reached Pongateague inlet. There the "Star" was waiting, but having
                            tasted her comforts on the march out, we magnanimously allowed our
                            Zouave brethren to march aboard, and concluded to wait for the next
                            steamer. After two long and dreary days, we boarded the "Wilson Small,"
                            where soon the disgusting fact became apparent that the accommodations
                            of the "Small' were worse than those of the "Star." I know nothing from
                            actual experience of the "horrors of the middle passage," but I shall
                            never forget the long agony of the voyage from Pongateague on the
                            "Wilson Small." There was nothing to eat, and neither room to lie down
                            nor stand up, with tobacco ejections an inch and a half deep all over
                            the decks. To add to the comforts of the trip, about one-third of the
                            boys got sea-sick, and were "heaving" right and left, without so much as
                            taking time to cry "stand from under."</p>
                        <p>Gen. Lockwood and staff, whether deservedly <pb id="VAA3891-248" n="243"
                            /> or not, were very unpopular with the troops. The general's personal
                            appearance was not prepossessing. He stuttered, wore spectacles, and
                            looked like a cross between a Presbyterian minister and a Jewish
                            pawnbroker. He was prolific in the matter of general orders, and his
                            "policy" appeared to have been shaped almost exclusively for the
                            protection of the rebels. Horses, known to have been employed in the
                            rebel cavalry, were released, after being seized, on the quibble that
                            they did not belong to the Confederate Government, but were merely hired
                            at so much a day. No seizure of arms could be made without first
                            obtaining a special order from the general, by which time they would be
                            removed to some new hiding-place. Most awful punishments impended over
                            the heads of those who, impelled by hunger or a longing for a change of
                            diet, dared to disturb the tranquility of secession poultry-yards, and
                            it was reported that a private of the Sixth Michigan was sent back to
                            Fort McHenry in irons for stealing a turnip. Secession owners, on whose
                            ground the troops camped, were paid good prices for fodder and corn, and
                            liberal damages for fuel burned. Some of them even asked to be paid for
                            the dead pine leaves the soldiers used for bedding.</p>
                        <p>The winter quarters of the Twenty-first Indiana were commodious and
                            comfortable. Four hundred were quartered inside the fort and six hundred
                            outside. Notwithstanding the unexampled mildness of the weather, our
                            boys suffered somewhat for the want of comfortable quarters, and it was
                            a <pb id="VAA3891-249" n="244"/> matter for congratulation when they
                            were at last housed, as the winter had begun in earnest. And they could
                            now speak out their defiance of cold, rain and mud, in the words of a
                            song which was immensely popular in the army, the burden of which is
                            that it is a matter of perfect indifference how the wide world wags, for
                            they are firmly resolved to be "gay and happy still."</p>
                        <p>A movement was at this time on foot to equip the entire regiment with new
                            guns&#151;the Merrill breech-loading rifle&#151;the soldiers
                            buying the guns themselves, with the expectation of being ultimately
                            reimbursed by the Government. As it then stood, we had in the regiment
                            two hundred and fifty Enfield rifles, about two hundred heavy Belgian
                            rifles, nearly as good as the Enfield, and the remainder of the guns
                            were miserable things&#151;infinitely worse than the old altered
                            smooth-bore muskets. Of these latter we had two kinds, one a
                            clumsy-looking affair, with a stationary sight, and a wide and uncertain
                            range in firing, which looked as if it had been roughly cast in some
                            country foundry; and the other a long gun with a thin barrel, a calibre
                            one or two sizes larger than the cartridge, a graduating sight, ranging
                            from fifty to one thousand four hundred yards, and a bayonet about a
                            yard in length. A good marksman, if in luck, might have occasionally hit
                            a good-sized barn at one hundred yards, provided he could have found one
                            of the guns with sufficient strength in the lock to explode the cap.
                            Some of these guns, from inscriptions on the stocks, we found belonged
                            to a <pb id="VAA3891-250" n="245"/> regiment which had a pretty fair
                            taste of the Bull Run fight. Armed with <hi rend="i">such</hi> weapons,
                            no fault could be found with them for running away. The only
                            reprehensible feature in it was that they did not leave their guns
                            behind.</p>
                        <p>Captain Hess's company contracted for and received the Merrill gun, a
                            breech-loader, with sabre bayonet, and universally admitted to be
                            superior to Sharpe's, or any other breech-loading gun. Simple in
                            construction&#151;not liable to get out of order&#151;it could
                            be fired with great rapidity and extraordinary accuracy at a range of
                            six hundred yards. The piece was also not so liable to become foul in
                            firing as muzzle-loading rifles. We fired them as often as eighty times
                            without cleaning.</p>

                            line. Ordinarily, a man in military life is not allowed to growl, if he
                            growls aloud; but even a court-martial seems preferable to spontaneous
                            combustion.</p>
                        <p>Prominent among the subjects provocative of growls at that time, were the
                            fantastic tricks of that great convention of donkeys, our National
                            Congress. What flashing scintillations of genius, what precious pearls
                            of wisdom fell from the lips of the <pb id="VAA3891-251" n="246"/> grave
                            and reverend seignors composing that august body, and were cast by the
                            oracular telegraph and the clanking steam-press before the millions of
                            lesser donkeys who peopled this great and glorious, and so forth!
                            Sagacious, provident, far-seeing Congress became alarmed at the inroads
                            upon our venerable Uncle's strong box, and turned with ferocious and
                            virtuous zeal from the pastime of investigating the conduct or
                            misconduct of the war to the work of retrenchment and reform, and to the
                            tightening of the purse-strings. Congress desired to economize, and
                            bills cutting down the pay of army officers were introduced, saving a
                            miserable pittance, while scoundrel contractors swindled the Nation by
                            the million. Congress cobbled with suttler bills and chaplain bills,
                            while our Grand Army of the Potomac rotted in foul winter quarters at a
                            cost of hundreds of lives and millions of dollars each day. The
                            trickling drops of the spigot were gathered and preserved, while the
                            great stream flowed steadily from the bung-hole. The somewhat novel
                            question of the disposition of rebel slaves also received its share of
                            attention&#151;a question peculiarly puzzling when considered in
                            conjunction with the fact, that we had not then nor were likely to have
                            soon, possession of any considerable amount of rebel territory
                            containing slaves. The scholarly Sumner, his one idea revivified and
                            invigorated by the application of the French <hi rend="i"
                            >moxa</hi>&#151;the pestilent and bellowing Lovejoy&#151;the

                            rebel slaves, between whom and Federal <pb id="VAA3891-252" n="247"/>
                            deliverance bristled long lines of rebel bayonets. The negro! <hi

                            abolition eloquence and floods of emancipation petitions, Congress
                            frittered away its precious time in idle vaporing.</p>
                        <p>"General McClellan had the enemy in a trap," we were told. While we
                            admired the charming simplicity, and envied the delicious
                            self-confidence of the devout believers in the "trap" theory, many of us
                            had greater faith in hard, solid fighting, than in science. It looked,
                            to our untutored minds, very much like the "trap" in which the lamented
                            John Ph&#156;nix caught the judge, during the progress of the famous
                            Sacramento fight, when, lying upon his back, he inserted his nose
                            between the judge's teeth <hi rend="i">for the purpose of holding him
                                down!</hi> Admitting the trap, was it not time, in all conscience,
                            that our "youthful commander" should seriously consider the propriety of
                            springing it and bagging his game? Some of us whose buttons were of the
                            basest brass, guiltless of gilt&#151;upon whose shoulders were no
                            insignia of rank, and whose chapeaux were unadorned with golden
                            bugles&#151;whose periodical drafts upon the treasury would not have
                            kept a contractor in cigars and champagne forty-eight hours, but who had
                            wives and friends at home whom we loved, and whose society we sadly
                            missed&#151;who had no particular fancy for military restraint, and
                            the necessary brute-life of the camp&#151;were anxious that the
                            infernal war should be brought to a speedy close. If the sense of the
                            entire army could have been <pb id="VAA3891-253" n="248"/> taken, its
                            united voice would have been O<hi rend="sc">NWARD.</hi> Fight to-day,
                            and if defeated, fight to-morrow, and the next day, and the day after.
                            If McClellan was not ready, he ought to have been. The miserable
                            mongrels of Mexico fought a superior race, and were defeated on two
                            successive days, at Palo Alto and Resaca de le Palma, and we thought it
                            a burning shame that an immense army, made up of the bravest, freest,
                            most intelligent men in the world, fighting for the perpetuation of the
                            fairest fabric of human government the sun ever shone upon, should, six
                            months after a defeat, not have recovered suffiicient strength and
                            confidence to have hazarded another battle. Oh! for a Napoleon; but our
                            Napoleon died when the brilliant Douglas yielded up his life and seemed
                            to leave no hero spirit behind him.</p>
                        <p>If we had had fewer smooth-bore muskets, no balloons, and less
                            new-fangled inventions for destroying our enemies without exposing
                            ourselves, it would have been better for the country. Longrange guns
                            make long wars. Encourage a soldier to believe that he can "pink" a
                            rebel at a thousand yards, and you will have difficulty to bring him
                            close enough to use the bayonet, or to become inspired with the genuine
                            battle frenzy. Among other nostrums of military quacks was that of the
                            Greek fire-shell, experimented with at Washington, which, fired from a
                            safe and convenient distance, was to explode over the camp of the sons
                            of Belial, covering them with a flood of fire, brimstone, naphtha and
                            other combustible ingredients. <pb id="VAA3891-254" n="249"/> Without
                            profanity, that might be termed a h&#151;ll of an invention.</p>
                        <p>While the war was thus being prosecuted with a most masterly in activity,
                            unblushing treason stalked in the broad light of day throughout the
                            West; increased its power and extended its influence day by day. Davis
                            remained unhung, and Vallandigham distilled his venom in the very halls
                            of Congress. Of all the traitors, rank and pestilent as they were, that
                            had been arrested by the authorities, could any have been pointed at
                            then as having received punishment, beyond a little temporary
                            confinement? Treason deliberated in open conclave at Indianapolis, and a
                            strong and powerful organization was at work to hamper and embarrass the
                            government in its efforts to subdue the rebellion. I tremble with
                            indignant rage at the reflection that those men prostituted the name
                            Democrat&#151;consecrated by the wisdom of a Jefferson and a
                            Douglas&#151;to their vile purposes.</p>

                            snows, sleets, hails, freezes and thaws. The depth of the mud was almost
                            incredible, and everything about the camp wore a nasty, humid look. The
                            Providence which tempers the wind to the shorn lamb brought us through,
                            however, with the <pb id="VAA3891-255" n="250"/> aid of such philosophy
                            as could be brought to bear upon ills of camp life in the rainy
                            season.</p>
                        <p>February 9, Captain Grimsley came in from the West with forty-three fine,
                            healthy-looking recruits for the Twenty-first, picked up by Major Hayes
                            and Lieutenant Elkins. Some few of them had seen service in the
                            three-months regiments, and in Fremont's body guard, but the most were
                            perfectly "raw," and fresh from the rural districts of Indiana. They
                            spent the day in looking about, staring at the new and strange scenes of
                            camp life, and listening in open-mouthed wonder to the whopping lies
                            with which they were industriously plied by their acquaintances, who had
                            had the advantages of our seven months' experience of military life. In
                            posting up the recruits as to the duties of camp life, and the rigor
                            with which any dereliction of duty was punished, our practical jokers
                            made a perfect raw-head-and-bloody-bones of the adjutant, gravely
                            telling them that the most of the men from our regiment reported as
                            having died were shot by the adjutant for failing to appear on dress
                            parade with clean white gloves and blackened boots.</p>
                        <p>It was at this period we fed ourselves with the idea that the services of
                            our regiment would soon be required in Kentucky. There was a rumor,
                            based on what foundation no one could say, that the Government had
                            concluded that Washington was safe enough, and that a large body of the
                            troops then eating the bread of idleness, might be safely withdrawn from
                            the East and judiciously <pb id="VAA3891-256" n="251"/> employed in the
                            West. It was said that the railroads had been notified to hold
                            themselves in readiness to transport sixty thousand troops at a moment's
                            notice.</p>
                        <p>But instead of being ordered to the West, we left our quarters at Fort
                            Marshall, on the afternoon of February 19, 1862, and were shipped aboard
                            the "Georgia" and "Georgiana" for Fortress Monroe. All along the route,
                            from our camp to the wharf, we were greeted with rapturous testimonials
                            of good will by the citizens. The sidewalks were thronged with women and
                            children wishing us God speed! and waving flags. In this respect our
                            departure was in charming contrast to our arrival the previous July.</p>
                        <p>We arrived at the Fortress on the afternoon of the 20th, remained over
                            night, then went down to Newport News, and into camp.</p>
                        <p>The scene about the Fortress was peculiarly interesting. Throngs of
                            officers and soldiers were about the wharf, the ragged sides of the "Rip
                            Raps" rose out of the water&#151;Sewall's Point was in the
                            distance&#151;little smoky tugs and gunboats darted about the harbor
                            in the most frantic manner, and the grim port-holes of many noble war
                            vessels lent additional interest to the picture. As we steamed down to
                            the News, a flag of truce, on its way to Craney Island, crept lazily
                            around Sewall's Point and the stars and bars of rebellion fluttered over
                            secession camps on the opposite shore.</p>
                        <p>Newport News was a queer-looking collection of long rows of barn-like
                            barracks, white tents and <pb id="VAA3891-257" n="252"/> cabins built of
                            pine logs set up endwise with the bark on, and the interstices plastered
                            with blue mud. The Cumberland and several other war vessels were
                            anchored in the harbor.</p>
                        <p>The first night we quartered in some horse sheds, but soon got into our
                            own tents. There were about six or eight thousand troops at Newport News
                            then, and more arriving daily.</p>
                        <p>Brigadier General Pierce, the hero of Great Bethel, then a colonel of a
                            regiment, was there. The 22d was celebrated by a roaring salute from the
                            war vessels in the harbor. We also heard guns from the secession camps,
                            but could not say whether they were firing them in honor of Washington's
                            memory, the inauguration of Jeff Davis, or were having a glorification
                            over the brilliant success of the Confederate arms at Fort Donelson.</p>
                        <p>Our sojourn at the News was anything but monotonous; the weather alone
                            afforded us infinite variety. After the heavy fall of rain and thorough
                            saturation that immediately succeeded our arrival, a terrible
                            gale&#151;in fact a perfect simoon&#151;swept over the
                            neighborhood for about eight hours. The storm came up suddenly about 11
                            o'clock A. M., and in a short time half the tents were prostrated, and
                            overcoats, blankets and miscellaneous articles of clothing were flying
                            through the air. The "sacred soil," which there consisted of a coarse
                            sand, rose in clouds, and was driven in stinging volleys into the face
                            and eyes of such as were so unfortunate as to be without shelter.</p>
                        <p>Down at the water, the scene, to one not accustomed <pb id="VAA3891-258"
                                n="253"/> to seeing old ocean on the rampage, bordered on the
                            sublime. The waves ran "mountain high" (small mountains), and the angry
                            roar of the surf was appalling. Far over towards the secession side,
                            tossing helplessly on the turbulent waters, and flying signals of
                            distress, two small vessels stood in imminent danger of being cast right
                            into the jaws of the enemy. Two small, black-loooking tugs, from
                            Fortress Monroe, steamed out to their rescue, and brought them in.</p>
                        <p>Our camp was called Butler. In the interim between our landing and the
                            sailing of the expedition, our time was neither idly nor unprofitably
                            spent. From ten to twelve we drilled in company, skirmish and bayonet
                            exercise; from two till five forty-five, battalion. The Twenty-first
                            Indiana compared favorably, in appearance and drill, with any of the
                            regiments there.</p>

                        <p>E<hi rend="sc">ARLY</hi> in March, 1862, we left Newport News, and after
                            a weary time, landed at Ship's Island, where for twenty-two days we
                            heard nothing from the outside world. We were literally famished for
                            news. For ought we knew, the world might have turned topsy-turvy, or the
                            "Dutch taken Holland," Our only mental pabulum was the lies out of whole
                            cloth which the Munchausens of the regiment were ever ready to feed to
                            us.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3891-259" n="254"/>
                        <p>After our landing we experienced an almost uninterrupted succession of
                            "Northers." The Norther is an institution of the Southern coast, with
                            which none need desire an acquaintance.</p>
                        <p>About the middle of April, we marched out from our encampment, leaving
                            our tents standing, and embarked on the "Great Republic." The Great
                            Republic was a large sail vessel, but not capable of accommodating three
                            thousand men. We thought we were crowded on the Constitution, but on the
                            Great Republic there was not room to eat, sleep, walk or breathe. The
                            lower decks were badly ventilated, and between them the men were packed
                            as closely as woolly heads on a slave ship. There were no berths for
                            sleeping, and the poor devils were compelled to lie prone on the deck,
                            packed like hogs in a rotten straw pile, reeking with horrible
                            filth.</p>
                        <p>After getting all ready for a start, the Jackson&#151;a little
                            gun-boat, formerly a New York ferry-boat&#151;hitched on to tow us
                            down to the Passes. The rest of the expedition got out of the harbor
                            very creditably, but we spent fifteen hours in frantic endeavors to turn
                            the Great Republic about, so that she might go out respectably, bow on,
                            and not like a crab. There was a deal of screaming and yelling, and
                            lusty swearing, and everybody worked themselves up almost to the
                            exploding point of ill-humor; but not an inch would the Great Republic
                            budge in the right direction. Her rudder had been so badly injured in a
                            gale a few nights previous as to be almost useless, and the little <pb
                                id="VAA3891-260" n="255"/> Jackson found she had got more than she
                            bargained for when she undertook to carry such a load. Finally, however,
                            the stubborn monster was headed right, but by this time the wind had
                            shifted and was dead ahead. We poked along, making about a knot in
                            sixteen hours. By sunset, Ship Island&#151;may the d&#151;l fly
                            away with it&#151;had faded away, and in the course of time, I can
                            not pretend to say how many days, but it seemed an age, we dropped
                            anchor at the S. W. Pass, where it seemed we were destined to stay for
                            the remainder of the season.</p>
                        <p>Our living on the Great Republic approached nearer a state of actual
                            starvation than at any other time. We had a ration of hard bread, about
                            an ounce of abominable pork or salt horse, and not quite a half pint of
                            villainous stuff called coffee, composed principally of burnt peas, or
                            some other substance. (General Butler's brother was postcommissary at
                            Ship Island, and if he was not himself engaged in swindling, he was
                            criminally negligent in allowing others to rob the government.) During
                            the voyage from Ship Island we were allowed a pint of water per
                            day&#151;totally inadequate to alleviate the horrible thirst
                            occasioned by the heat and salt food. Once or twice we had beans and
                            rice, but so miserably cooked that even the stomach of an ostrich would
                            have rejected the unsavory mess.</p>
                        <p>While anchored there, we heard them hammering away at Fort Jackson for
                            five days, with what effect we did not know at that time. The fort was
                                <pb id="VAA3891-261" n="256"/> thirty-five or forty miles above us,
                            by the river, but probably not more than thirty-five in a direct line.
                            When the state of the atmosphere and the wind were favorable, we could
                            distincly hear the thun-dering of the big mortars, and the sharp
                            responses of the rifle guns from the fort, and see the thick clouds of
                            sulphurous smoke shoot upward and spread over the horizon after each
                            discharge. One night the bombardment seemed more terrific than at any
                            previous time. By climbing to the cross-trees, on the main mast, I
                            succeeded in getting a magnificent view of the contest, which amply
                            repaid me for the danger of breaking my neck. The great sheets of flame
                            belched from the capacious mortar mouths were distinctly visible,
                            reddening the sky for a moment, while an occasional shell bursting in
                            the air short of its destination, would be seen for an instant like a
                            brilliant meteor, and then disappear. Large volumes of flames would
                            occasionally shoot up, and burn fiercely for half an hour. Those we
                            conjectured to be fire-rafts, sent down from the fort with the hope of
                            destroying the mortar fleet. From the indications, we were inclined to
                            think Commodore Porter had his work cut out for him that time, and found
                            Forts Jackson and St. Philip a tough job&#151;tougher than salt
                            horse and army bread. All accounts represented the rebel guns as having
                            been served with a skill and efficiency quite remarkable.</p>
                        <p>A story went the rounds that our excellent major general thought he could
                            run up in the night and look at the immense chain stretched across the
                                <pb id="VAA3891-262" n="257"/> river, about a quarter of a mile this
                            side of Fort Jackson. I suppose he was anxious to go up and reconnoitre,
                            principally because he had no business there. He did not propose to do
                            anything except satisfy his curiosity. Reticence is a virtue peculiarly
                            prominent in great commanders, and Major General B. F. B. informed no
                            one of his intentions, but, taking a small steamer, and a judicious
                            selection from his staff, he quietly and cautiously steamed up the
                            river, in the direction of the mysterious obstacle. The lookout on one
                            of the outlying mortar boats, seeing a suspicious craft stealing past,
                            hailed it. No answer was returned, and the suspicious craft kept
                            steadily on its course. One of the big-throated mortars was hastily
                            trained to bear on the m. g's. boat. A thundering report made the waters
                            tremble, and a thirteen inch shell burst in uncomfortable proximity to
                            the party of reconnoisance. The general's boat was promptly put about,
                            and he made excellent time down the river, his curiosity fully
                            satisfied. Unfortunately, he did not halt for a second hint, or the
                            country might have been relieved of as pure a patriot as ever voted
                            fifty-seven times for Jeff. Davis in the Charleston convention.</p>
                        <p>General Thomas Williams, commanding our present brigade, might not be
                            considered unworthy of a slight notice at my hands. The general was a
                            Vermonter by birth, and until the breaking out of the rebellion was a
                            captain or a major in the regular army. He was a man about five feet
                            eight inches in height, slender, florid complexion, 17 <pb
                                id="VAA3891-263" n="258"/> whiskers all over his face, and hair
                            originally auburn in color, but then nearly gray, a fact to be
                            attributed to service and constant study of military science rather than
                            to the frosts of many winters. He had the cold, merciless gray eye,
                            inseparably connected with the idea of a great commander, but it lacked
                            depth, its expression being peculiarly shallow. At a glance you were
                            liable to be "taken in" by the surface glitter, but a closer inspection
                            discovered the sham, and lead inevitably to the conclusion that "there
                            was nothing in it." He carried his head high in the air, wore a
                            McClellan cap, and had a fashion when in the field of shading his eyes
                            by placing his hand transversely across his forehead, palm downward,
                            thumb resting on the nose, and little finger turned outward.</p>
                        <p>The general had three or four aids&#151;smooth-faced, soft-looking
                            striplings, who looked as if they would appear to greater advantage
                            "capering nimbly in a lady's drawing room," or learning the rule of
                            three in a village school, rather than on the tented field. Through them
                            we got at second hand their chief's ideas about military affairs. It was
                            very much like a pale refraction of moonshine.</p>
                        <p>The general was proprietor of a new and unheard-of man&#156;uvre,
                            which he called the "order of combat," by which a regiment was thrown
                            into a sort of echelon, one division in front, a division on either
                            flank, and division distance in the rear, and two divisions massed in
                            the rear of these, and <pb id="VAA3891-264" n="259"/> crossing the
                            division in front. The movement was open to the objection not only of
                            being absolutely worthless, but of laying a whole regiment under fire,
                            with only one division, or at best three, able to do anything. It could
                            not be effected by any combination of commands, in the tactics, but in
                            changing direction, etc., new commands must be invented. The whole
                            proceeding was irregular and awkward, yet on the subject of "order of
                            combat," Gen. Williams was a monomaniac.</p>
                        <p>The following incident happened at Ship Island. The troops were drawn up
                            in brigade line, when the general thought it advisable to bring them to
                            a "shoulder arms." Rising in his stirrups he called but, "Shouldah!" The
                            colonels repeated the command, and the general, after waiting a few
                            moments and seeing that no one moved, again called out sharply, "<hi
                                rend="i">Shoul</hi>-dah!" Still no one stirred, and the general
                            shaded his eyes to see if he could detect the difficulty. "Shoul-<hi
                                rend="i">dah!</hi>" he again blurted out with increasing animation.
                            The colonels repeated the command, but still the butts of the rifles
                            clung pertinaciously to the sand. In utter astonishment the general sent
                            Adjutant General Wyckham Hoffman along the line to instruct the officers
                            to repeat the command. After his aid had returned he roared out,
                                "Shoul-<hi rend="i">dah!</hi>" Colonels, officers, and
                            non-commissioned officers re-echoed "Shoulder!" but all to no purpose.
                            The general, almost bursting with rage, shook his fist at Colonels Payne
                            and McMillan, whom he chose to consider at the bottom of all devilment,
                                <pb id="VAA3891-265" n="260"/> and started down with the intention
                            of generally blowing up everybody, when he suddenly remembered that he
                            had forgotten to give the command of execution, "Arms." Since then,
                            while taking his airings on the poop of the Great Republic, he was
                            frequently startled with stentorian cries of "Shouldah!"</p>
                        <p>The general, with his aids and servants, monopolized the cabin, and would
                            not allow even a colonel to domesticate with him. The general lay in his
                            comfortable bunk beside an open window, enjoying the sunshine and
                            breeze, and weighing the argument in favor of and against the propriety
                            of getting up, when one of our colonels came along, and leaning over the
                            taffrail, with his portly figure, intercepted the general's streak of
                            sun-light. "Get away from there&#151;<hi rend="i">you!</hi>" roared
                            the amiable Napoleon of the Second brigade, N. E. D. You had better
                            believe there was a mad colonel around about that time.</p>

                        <p>F<hi rend="sc">ORTS</hi> Jackson and St. Philip fell. New Orleans had
                            surrendered, and the flag waved over the custom house. The heavy
                            blockading squadron at the mouths of the river was relieved. It was not
                            my good fortune to witness the glorious scene attending the bombardment.
                            After fooling around the Pass until we were all heartily sick and
                            disgusted, <pb id="VAA3891-266" n="261"/> being transferred daily from
                            one vessel to another, in vain endeavors to so lighten the Great
                            Republic that she could be taken over the bar, on the afternoon of the
                            25th of April, while aboard the steam frigate Colorado, we received
                            orders to move around in the rear of Fort St. Philip, in the vicinity of
                            Black Lake Bay, and disembark. The Colorado, to the officers and crew or
                            which we were under obligations for kind treatment, was temporarily
                            under the command of Lieut. Davis, of Carlisle, Indiana, a fine specimen
                            of the thorough seaman, gallant officer, and finished gentleman. The
                            order for disembarkation in the rear of Fort St. Philip was given by
                            Gen. Butler, in consequence of information that the two forts would be
                            ours, as soon as we chose to take them, and was designed to cut off the
                            retreat of the rebel garrisons in that direction. After another transfer
                            to the filthy decks of the Great Republic, which, coming from the clean,
                            smooth floors of the Colorado, seemed like a descent from a
                            well-furnished parlor to a hog-stye, we were taken in tow by a steam
                            craft of some sort, and carried around to the rear of the fort, where we
                            dropped anchor on the morning of the 27th. There we were again
                            transferred to the gunboat Miami, and ran in as close to the land as her
                            draught of water would permit. We were still five or six miles off,
                            which distance had to be traversed in small boats. A narrow strip of
                            swamp land, covered with reeds and willows, ran between the water and
                            the Mississippi. Forts St. Philip and Jackson were <pb id="VAA3891-267"
                                n="262"/> plainly visible from the deck of the Miami, and to our
                            gratification, we found the old flag waving over both. This necessitated
                            another change in the programme, and we put back to the Miami to Pass a
                            l'Outre. Directly after her coming to an anchor in Black Lake Bay, and
                            while yet aboard the Republic, we were startled by a loud, rumbling
                            explosion. Looking in the direction of Fort St. Philip, a dense volume
                            of smoke was seen shooting up hundreds of feet in the air, and spreading
                            far and wide over the horizon. At first we supposed the fort itself had
                            been blown up, but it proved to be an immense floating battery,
                            constructed by the rebels of a floating dock, and heavily covered with
                            railroad iron.</p>
                        <p>Nothing more dreary could be imagined than the view from a steamer's deck
                            in the neighborhood of the Passes. The mouths of the river strike out
                            from the main channel like the roots of a tree, in all directions.
                            Between each of the Passes is a thin strip of morass covered with cane,
                            grass and weeds, but no timber. Among the dense lines of green, rank
                            vegetation, the alligator, the filthy moccasin snake, and fierce, biting
                            insects make their homes. Wild fowls of various kinds flap their wings
                            over the wide, dismal waste. Ungainly pelicans and screaming sea-gulls
                            circled about the vessels, the former making occasional plunges into the
                            water in pursuit of fish, and the latter fighting and scrambling for
                            scraps of meat and such other garbage as was thrown overboard.
                            Miscellaneous collections of logs, stumps, pieces <pb id="VAA3891-268"
                                n="263"/> of wrecks and entire trees&#151;some of them perhaps
                            from the head waters of the Missouri&#151;lodged on the bars or
                            imbedded themselves in the loose, Spongy mud of the swamps. Altogether,
                            the scene was such that even the most mercurial temperament must be
                            saddened and depressed by it. Above, the forts and plantations began to
                            appear, and the scene changed, as if by magic, from utter desolation to
                            one of exquisite beauty. Highly-cultivated sugar farms were seen on
                            either side; the fresh green rows of the young cane extended in parallel
                            lines back to the swamp, and reminded one forcibly of a vast Western
                            corn-field in June. Neat rows of wooden houses afforded shelter to the
                            black bone and muscle we saw toiling in the cane, and gave to the
                            plantation a village-like appearance. The planters' residences were
                            perfect models of quaintness in architecture and beauty of surroundings.
                            Embowered in a dense growth of flowers and shrubbery, from the midst of
                            which the magnolia&#151;glorious with the richness of its deep-green
                            shining leaves and the unapproachable beauty of its large white
                            flowers&#151;sent forth its grateful fragrance. They looked
                            peculiarly inviting, especially to us poor fellows, whose latest
                            recollections were of the Sahara-like barrenness of Ship Island, and the
                            horrid seventeen days of misery, crammed, up without room to turn about
                            or lie down, between the loathsome, fetid decks of a dirty
                            transport.</p>
                        <p>Just above the light-house in Pass a l'Outre, was a little settlement of
                            frame houses, built on piles <pb id="VAA3891-269" n="264"/> and called
                            Alligator Town. It was formerly populated by a colony of bar pilots, but
                            was nearly deserted. There we anchored for the purpose of receiving a
                            mail from the Rhode Island, just without the bar, and on her way to the
                            Southwest Pass. The American flag was flying over one of the houses, on
                            the piazza of which we discovered a live woman, some darkies, and
                            several children, with a weather-beaten Dutchman or Spaniard in the
                            fore-ground, who, on discovering our approach, removed a dilapidated hat
                            from his head and caused it to describe a series of circles in the air,
                            accompanying the movement with husky roars, a vigorous fancy dance, and
                            other demonstrations of joy. On passing the forts, we were all on the
                            lookout for evidence of the hot work which had been going on there, but
                            from the river both Forts Jackson and Philip appeared to be little
                            damaged. Looking at the position of the two forts, the fact that our
                            fleet was enabled to run the gauntlet of their terrible fire with so
                            little injury, seemed to be almost miraculous. We stopped at the
                            quarantine for coal. There we found two hundred and fifty rebel
                            prisoners, taken by the Twenty-sixth Massachusetts in the rear of St.
                            Philip, while attempting to escape. They were a motley, hard-favored set
                            (mostly foreigners), some of them uniformed in the coarse cotton goods
                            used throughout the South for clothing negroes, called osnaburgs, and
                            all wearing shirts made of bright colored Bay State shawls, worn with
                            the fringed tails outside of the pants. These variegated shirts, with
                            their bright <pb id="VAA3891-270" n="265"/> red and green colors, gave
                            the crest-fallen rebs-quite a gay and festive appearance. The greatest
                            part of the batch told the same old story, so convenient for rebels in
                            reduced circumstances. They had been "pressed," or driven to the service
                            by pecuniary embarrassment, and the gnawings of hunger. All but two of
                            them took the oath of allegiance and were released. Some half a dozen or
                            more enlisted in our regiment. Just above the quarantine, with her
                            smoke-stack and masts sticking out of the water, lay the wreck of the
                            gunboat. Verona&#151;the handsomest and fastest gunboat in the
                            service, which was sunk by the ram Manassas. In the vicinity of
                            Jackson's old battle-ground, we passed a formidable series of land and
                            water defenses, comprising a system of earth-works on the left bank,
                            extending clear back to the swamp, which would have seriously
                            embarrassed the approach of a land force. Our gallant navy, however,
                            made short work of them, and the evidences of a brisk business, while it
                            lasted, were abundant. The earth-works along the bank were literally
                            torn to pieces with shot and shell, and a sugar-house on the left bank
                            was completely riddled, apparently from the fire of their own battery on
                            the other bank.</p>
                        <p>Passing the battle-ground, the spires and domes of the Crescent City were
                            plainly seen. A residence of several years had rather attached me to New
                            Orleans, and it was not without a feeling akin to sadness that I
                            contemplated the abundant evidences of distress caused by the blockade,
                            which was <pb id="VAA3891-271" n="266"/> manifested on every hand as we
                            steamed around the lower horn. The appearance of the city was gloomy in
                            the extreme. I was there during the fearful visitation of the yellow
                            fever in 1853, and not even then was it half so dismal. Of the vast
                            forests of masts, almost blocking up the river in former times, not one
                            was to be seen, unless, from the deck of a war-ship or gunboat,
                            bristling with hostile guns. Not a single one of the great fleet of
                            up-river steamers, bearing the rich produce of the great West to its
                            natural outlet, then smoked and puffed at the warf. The space allotted
                            to broad horns was also vacant. The wharves, usually piled up with
                            cotton, and corn, and sugar, and miscellaneous merchandise, were
                            perfectly bare. No thundering drays, or furiously-driven omnibusses were
                            seen in the streets, and the business houses were closed. With exception
                            of a mixed throng of laborers, rowdies, darkies, women and children, who
                            crowded the wharves to see us land, the city seemed to be utterly
                            deserted&#151;dreary, desolate, dismal, dead and d&#151;d. Not
                            so much as the ghost of its wonted greatness wandered among what were
                            the haunts of busy trade, to remind one of the New Orleans of former
                            days.</p>
                        <p>Our blockade has been called "inefficient" by the captious cavilers of
                            the British press; but inefficient or not, the appearance of New Orleans
                            at that time bore ample testimony to the terrible pressure to which her
                            people had been subjected. We tied up at the foot of Julia street, and
                            lay there several hours, but did not go ashore. A large crowd <pb
                                id="VAA3891-272" n="267"/> collected around the Miami to satisfy
                            their curiosity, by having a stare at the d&#151;d Yankees. We were
                            ordered to hold no communication with any one on shore. Finally, we cast
                            off from the wharf, dropped down to the lower end of the city, crossed
                            over to Algiers, and took up quarters in the depot of the New Orleans,
                            Opelousas and Great Western railroad. All the Algierines we had seen
                            were as virulent secessionists as their neighbors over the way, though I
                            had little doubt but there was some Union feeling among them. The
                            citizens of Algiers depended, in former times, a great deal on the dry
                            docks for employment, and, in fact, the building and repairing of
                            vessels was the principal business of the place. The destruction of
                            these docks, by order of Gen. Lovell, had, as I learned from a little
                            secesh paper, published here, called the <hi rend="i">Newsboy,</hi>
                            caused a great deal of indignation among them. They gathered around our
                            quarters, some looking crest-fallen, some sullen, and some stolidly
                            indifferent. The negroes, on the other hand, all looked pleased. The
                            idea was fully fixed in their poor muddled brains that our mission was
                            to set them free.</p>
                        <p>General Williams was in command of Fort Jackson, with the Twenty-sixth
                            Massachusetts. We hoped he had the "order of combat" there, and kept it
                            closely confined. The Ninth Connecticut, Thirtieth and Thirty-first
                            Massachusetts, Sixth Michigan, Fourth Wisconsin, and other troops,
                            landed on the other side. Lying at the foot of Julia street, while the
                            saucy rebels were ringing the <pb id="VAA3891-273" n="268"/> changes on
                            Bull Run, the band suddenly struck up "Picayune Butler's coming,
                            coming." Seces-sia did not relish the joke. Our dress parade in Algiers
                            was graced by the presence of some half a dozen or more pale-faced
                            daughters of the South, with secession colors conspicuously displayed on
                            their bosoms. They did not appear to be so rabid as the fair Baltimore
                            rebels, and conducted themselves becomingly.</p>
                        <p>The Dey of Algiers was a terrible fellow, but we dreaded the night more.
                            The mosquitoes, as well as the chivalry, hungered and thirsted for the
                            blood of the "d&#151;d Yankees."</p>
                        <p>The Mississippi was very high, and only a few inches of soil intervened
                            between safety and a disastrous overflow of Algiers. The <hi rend="i"
                                >Newsboy</hi> of the twenty-fifth, with commendable philosophy,
                            congratulated the citizens on the fact of there being no steamers to
                            lash the waters against the yielding levees. Now, the Federal fleet had
                            deprived them, of even that cold comfort.</p>

                        <p>W<hi rend="sc">HILE</hi> we were comfortably quartered in the depot, we
                            spent the time very profitably in cleaning up in person, clothing, arms
                            and accoutrements, scouring the neighboring country for arms and other
                            property belonging to the Confederates, and, as far as <pb
                                id="VAA3891-274" n="269"/> possible, recovering from the horrible
                            effects of that sea voyage from Ship Island. When the fleet made their
                            appearance before the city, a great deal of property was left on the
                            field, by the Confederate troops, in the general scamper which ensued.
                            This trumpery was hastily carted off and secreted on the different
                            plantations in the neighborhood; but through the energetic efforts of
                            Lieutenant Colonel Keith and other officers, much of it was recovered. A
                            large number of field-pieces, shot, shell and small arms, hospital
                            stores and bedding, flour and other provisions, clothing, camp
                            bedsteads, officers' swords, saddles, harness, canteens, knapsacks,
                            haversacks, etc., had accumulated on our hands. In a large foundry in
                            the village of Gretna, about three miles from us, there were thousands
                            of shot and shell, several of the largest kind of unfinished cannon,
                            gun-stocks, etc. In this establishment the manufacture of war munitions
                            appeared to have been extensively and skillfully carried on. Connected
                            with the manufactory of iron articles was a brass establishment for the
                            manufacture of brass cannon, mountings and plates. In the foundry we
                            found a large number of unfinished sword-bayonets, bearing evidence of
                            skillful workmanship.</p>
                        <p>Within two miles of our encampment we found a lot of beef cattle, which a
                            Frenchman, named Bonte, was pasturing for the Confederates. They were
                            not in the best possible order for butchering, and I presume would
                            scarcely be exposed for sale by any respectable butcher in any city
                            market, but a long and irksome regimen of "salt horse" and <pb
                                id="VAA3891-275" n="270"/> rusty pork left us in a condition by no
                            means fastidious, and the Confederate beef was eaten with a relish.</p>
                        <p>Having taken possession, for the time being, of the railroad, we kept its
                            rolling stock tolerably busy in transporting scouting parties to and
                            from different points on the road, manning the trains with engineers,
                            firemen, brakemen and conductors from our own ranks.</p>
                        <p>On a little island in the bayou, des Alemands, about two hundred yards
                            above the bridge, secreted in an abandoned dwelling, we made a good haul
                            of powder, fixed ammunition, saddles, artillery harness, and knapsacks,
                            canteens, etc. Two brass six-pound field-pieces had been in position on
                            the island for the purpose of commanding the bridge, but had been
                            removed before our visit. A rigid cross-examination of such of the white
                            natives as we could pick up failed to elicit anything as to the
                            whereabouts of the missing guns, but a little judicious inquiry among
                            the colored population was more successful, and we found them in a boat
                            up a little creek, about half a mile from the bayou. I may as well
                            confess right here that whatever success attended our scouting and
                            foraging expeditions, was mainly due to the alacrity with which the
                            darkeys gave us information. They almost universally showed themselves
                            willing and anxious to benefit us in every possible way. Occasionally,
                            however, one was found silly enough to believe all they had latterly
                            been told of us&#151;that we would take them North, where there was
                            snow all the year <pb id="VAA3891-276" n="271"/> round, and make them
                            work day and night in coal mines, and lead mines, and other stuff of a
                            like nature; but the most of them believed that for them the millennium
                            had come, and even the most intelligent, who perfectly understood that
                            the war was not a war for the abolition of slavery, still believed that
                            their condition would, somehow or other, be materially bettered by the
                            triumph of the Federal arms.</p>
                        <p>About this time I went on an expedition up the country, which resulted in
                            the capture of the steamer Morning Light, in the Red river, a few miles
                            above the mouth. Col. McMillan went up with a squad of fifty men, on the
                            "Bee," an old rickety, wheezing concern, built at Portsmouth, Ohio, and
                            a little larger than an ordinary chicken coop. The Morning Light was a
                            fine, large boat, and one of the many which were hastily taken out of
                            New Orleans port on the approach of the fleet, and had been ever since
                            skulking about in the numerous bayous and lakes in the western part of
                            the State. She had taken a cargo of sugar up Bayou Macon, to change for
                            cattle, and had just returned to the island plantation owned by Mrs.
                            Turnbull, a few miles above the mouth of Red river, as we came up. A
                            large quantity of sugar was still aboard.</p>
                        <p>Gen. Butler made a favorable impression upon the well-disposed citizens
                            of the town and country. Whatever opinion may be entertained of his
                            military qualifications, that he was master of his situation was
                            evident. In no particular was this fact <pb id="VAA3891-277" n="272"/>
                            more manifest than in his prompt and judicious handling of the banks and
                            money-sharks of the city. His policy may have caused temporary distress,
                            but the financial bubble was so monstrously swollen that it must soon
                            have burst without interference. The people of Louisiana had been the
                            victims of the most unheard of scoundrelism by the leaders and abettors
                            of that unholy war. Familiar as we were with the villainy of shoddy
                            contractors in the North, their "operations" were but molehills to the
                            mountainous rascalities of Jew harpies of the South. Duplicate and
                            triplicate bank notes and shinplasters had been circulated all over the
                            country. Even Confederate treasury notes had been duplicated. It was no
                            unusual thing to see gentlemen possessed of two Confederate notes of the
                            same number and denomination, made on the same plate, and bearing the
                            same signatures. Army officers, army contractors, State officials, and
                            money dealers, all, apparently, conspired to plunder the people. No city
                            in the United States, of the same business, had ever been so uniformly
                            rich in coin as New Orleans; and yet, when we came here, you might have
                            hunted the city over without finding an ounce of specie. The hard money
                            had been absorbed by these sharks, with the intention of making their
                            escape from the country before the crash. John Slidell, who counted his
                            property in that State by the million twelve months ago, it was then
                            said, did not own ten thousand dollars' worth. Probably a cosy chateau
                            in France had already been purchased, to afford the old villain a quiet
                                <pb id="VAA3891-278" n="273"/> resting place from the arduous labors
                            of his scoundrel life.</p>
                        <p>The trains to Berwick Bay had been allowed to run, under charge of some
                            of our officers, for the purpose of bringing beef to the suffering
                            citizens. For some time the shipment of beef had been nearly suspended
                            by the intervention of an armed banditti in the beef parishes, who
                            refused to allow any cattle to be shipped, although knowing they were
                            intended for the citizens of New Orleans. The train from that place was
                            taken possession of by an armed band of marauders, several hundred in
                            number. Lieutenants Cox and Connelly, of our regiment, and five Michigan
                            soldiers, they held as prisoners. They cut the levee thirteen miles
                            above, and a fearful crevasse inundated that part of the country. The
                            water was six feet deep over the railroad track. After cutting the levee
                            they retreated with the train toward the bay, burning the bridges over
                            bayous Des Allemands, Lafourche and B&#156;uf. An expedition, under
                            Col. McMillan, left to reach the bay by means of bayou Atchafalaya and
                            its connections.</p>
                        <p>Some of the most desperate and bloody encounters of the rebellion are
                            either unknown to the historian, or are deemed unworthy of more than a
                            brief allusion. The newspapers were exceedingly liberal at the beginning
                            of the struggle, and chronicled the battle of Romney, and the sanguinary
                            engagement at Phillippi, in voluminous columns of eulogy. But as events
                            crowded on each other, such small affairs were passed over with a brief
                            18 <pb id="VAA3891-279" n="274"/> mention, while it required a Shiloh or
                            Gettysburg to bring out the war eloquence in its full strength and
                            fervor. The fight at Lafourche Crossing, Louisiana, where a small
                            detachment of Union forces, unable to run away, met the onslaught of a
                            larger number of rebels, flushed with a previous victory and drunk with
                            Louisiana rum, has passed out of, or rather, never entered into, the
                            history of the war. Yet it was probably the best illustration of
                            desperate courage, on both sides, that the war afforded, and was
                            attended with greater carnage, in proportion to the number of men
                            engaged, than any of the historic battles which shook the nation to its
                            center. At Lafourche the rebels charged repeatedly in the face of
                            batteries that belched continuous volleys of canister, and many of them
                            were bayoneted at the very muzzles of the Union guns. Charging a
                            battery, in war literature, usually means an advance by an attacking
                            force, and the retreat of the artillerists before the force come within
                            reach of the bayonet, or else the attacking force turns tail after a
                            sufficient taste of grape and canister; but at Lafourche the advance of
                            the rebels meant business, and many of them were torn to pieces by
                            discharges of canister, which struck them within twelve feet of the
                            muzzles, the survivors being transfixed with the bayonet or taken
                            prisoner.</p>
                        <p>The capture of the Fox was one of the early events of Butler's occupation
                            of Louisiana, which has not received sufficient notice at the hands of
                            the historian. The Fox was one of the swiftest <pb id="VAA3891-280"
                                n="275"/> and sharpest of the blockade runners which eluded the
                            vigilance of our navy in that latitude, and she made trips with almost
                            the regularity of a packet ship between Nassau and the Louisiana coast,
                            landing her cargoes in some secluded inlet, and getting away before her
                            presence was discovered. The cruisers all knew the Fox, and had often
                            chased her without effect. Shortly after the occupation of Algiers by
                            the Twenty-first Indiana, a Union man brought intelligence to Col.
                            McMillan that a blockade runner had put into Grand Caillou, which
                            empties into the Gulf on the western coast. The colonel reported the
                            fact to Gen. Butler, and asked permission to attempt her capture, which
                            was readily granted. Taking a small detachment of men, the colonel
                            started on the Berwick Bay railroad, and arrived at Terre Bonne station
                            a little after dark. From Terre Bonne the distance to the mouth of Grand
                            Caillou is between twenty and twenty-five miles&#151;most too great
                            to insure his getting there before daylight, if he traveled as infantry.
                            He accordingly sent out squads of men to the plantations adjacent to
                            Terre Bonne, and impressed mules and carts enough to transport his men.
                            Having obtained the necessary transportation, the force set out for the
                            objective point in a brisk mule walk, occasionally enlivened by a
                            trot.</p>
                        <p>The town of Houma&#151;a neat, handsome place of perhaps a thousand
                            inhabitants, bearing about it the usual characteristics of the Louisiana
                            French village&#151;lay on the line of march. Not caring to alarm
                            the neighborhood, and thus send the news <pb id="VAA3891-281" n="276"/>
                            of his coming ahead of the detachment, the colonel enjoined the most
                            rigorous silence on his men, and the cavalcade passed through the silent
                            and deserted streets of the village with no other sound than the
                            trampling feet of the mules, and the creak of a neglected cart-wheel,
                            which wailed for the want of grease. Not a light was to be
                            seen&#151;not a night-capped head was thrust from an upper
                            window&#151;not a dog barked&#151;and it was thought that the
                            detachment had passed through without attracting attention. Subsequent
                            events, however, showed this to have been a mistake. A belated bummer,
                            who had tumbled down in a fence corner to sleep off his potations, was
                            awakened by the creaking of the ungreased cart-wheel, and, with eyes
                            bulging from their sockets, took an inventory of the ghostly cavalcade
                            as it filed silently by in the uncertain light of a starless night. Next
                            morning his tale of armed men, with horses and cannon, stealing silently
                            through the sacred streets of Houma, was regarded by many as a drunken
                            dream; but an arrival from Terre Bonne, detailing with many
                            exaggerations the impressment of mules and carts, lent an air of reality
                            to the drunkard's dream.</p>
                        <p>The passage through Houma having been successfully accomplished, the
                            detachment was ordered to continue its march on quick time, and,
                            stimulated by the cart whip, the plantation mules developed a speed
                            which was gratifying as well as surprising. The colonel was exceedingly
                            anxious to arrive at the mouth of Grand Caillou as soon as possible. He
                            knew that a horseman, mounted on a swift <pb id="VAA3891-282" n="277"/>
                            steed, could leave Terre Bonne an hour or so after him, pass him on the
                            road by making a detour, and arrive at Grand Caillou in time to enable
                            the sly Fox to get up steam, and be far out on the raging billow before
                            his mule express could reach there. He counted, however on the terror of
                            the people about Terre Bonne, a want of decision, and a lack of
                            information as the object of the expedition. He accordingly spurred the
                            jaded mules on their way, while the hoarse bellow of the alligator was
                            heard from the neighboring swamps, and the horned owl hooted a
                            remonstrant greeting from the roadside trees. The men, in total
                            ignorance of the object of the expedition, discussed in low whispers the
                            various probabilities, and were all eager as a pack of hounds to pounce
                            on the quarry, whatever it might be.</p>
                        <p>Time passed, and in the gray twilight of early morning the detachment was
                            halted, and a recon-noitering force, under command of a sergeant, sent
                            out. Proceeding down the bayou, as the fog lifted, the sergeant
                            discovered the black, dingy-looking hull of the Fox, as she lay moored
                            to the bank, surrounded by boxes and bales of her partially discharged
                            cargo. With the exception of a single sentinel, pacing sleepily to and
                            fro, and occasionally looking wistfully toward the east in anticipation
                            of sunrise, there was no sign of life about the Fox. She was, in sooth,
                            an innocent-looking craft, and for all outward signs to the contrary,
                            might have been an asthmatic tug laying up for repairs. Yet the
                            operations of the next few moments, <pb id="VAA3891-283" n="278"/>
                            successfuly conducted, would be worth as much as the winning of a battle
                            to the government.</p>
                        <p>The colonel divided his force, crossed half of them to the other side of
                            the bayou, and the two detachments, marching simultaneously, crept
                            silently along the banks of the black, sluggish stream toward their
                            prey. The sentinel walked lazily to and fro, yawning at intervals, and
                            occasionally sitting down on a bulk-head to ruminate. The two wings of
                            the attacking force approached nearer and nearer. Finally the vigilant
                            sentinel heard something, looked up and saw something. His sleepy eyes
                            unclosed to their widest extent, but still he did not appreciate the
                            situation. He saw that armed men were approaching, but he had not yet
                            heard of the fall of New Orleans, and he would as soon have expected to
                            meet the ghost of his great grandfather as Yankees in that secluded
                            place. Finally it dawned on him that there might be something improper
                            in allowing people to whom he had never been introduced, approach in
                            that way, and that he had better demonstrate. He accordingly fired off
                            his musket&#151;threw it away, and rushed howling into the cabin.
                            The order was given to double quick, and the two detachments closed
                            around the vessel. A walk-board had been conveniently left on the side
                            to which she was moored, and the force on that side boarded in gallant
                            style. All was confusion on the blockade runner. The engineer plunged
                            overboard from the stern, and swam to the opposite shore, where a big
                            corporal reached down, caught him by the collar, and swung him <pb
                                id="VAA3891-284" n="279"/> dripping like a drowned rat, to dry land.
                            The captain, dressed in a cool, flowing costume of snowy muslin, tumbled
                            out of his berth with a bright, new English revolver in his hand, but
                            surrendered, as soon as the urgency of the case was explained to him.
                            The colored steward, his face turned to an ashen hue, was down on his
                            knees praying fluently for mercy. The crew were protesting that they
                            were Union at heart, but had been impressed into the service.</p>
                        <p>Order was soon restored, however, and the Fox, with her crew and cargo,
                            passed from the Confederate States of America to the United thereof. The
                            captain and crew were paroled not to attempt to escape. The engineer and
                            pilot, however, were deemed too valuable to take any risks in their
                            cases. Their parole was taken, but at the same time the colonel deemed
                            it advisable to keep them under strict <hi rend="i">surveillance,</hi>
                            to frustrate any attempt at "lighting out."</p>
                        <p>About half the Fox's cargo had been discharged and hauled away. Colonel
                            McMillan, however, was in no hurry. He ascertained where it had been
                            stored, and had it hauled back again and reloaded. In a day or two the
                            Fox was again ready for sea. There being no custom-house formalities to
                            undergo, she steamed out of the mouth of the black, sluggish bayou, and
                            bore away for New Orleans. The colonel's nautical education had been
                            neglected. He had breasted the billowy waves of the Wabash as skipper of
                            a flatboat, and was every inch a sailor on the "walk-board," with <pb
                                id="VAA3891-285" n="280"/> the end of the steering oar under his
                            arm; but when it came to the use of the sextant, and working out a "dead
                            reckoning" by lunar or solar observations, he was all at sea. So he was
                            compelled to trust to the officers of the Fox. It was explained to them,
                            however, that their treatment depended very much on their behavior. If
                            they took the ship safely over the bar at the mouth of the Mississippi,
                            they would be considered jolly good fellows; if, on the contrary, they
                            attempted any of their tricks on landsmen, the moment their treachery
                            was discovered, there would be immediate incision and imbruing. With
                            this understanding, the best of relations were established between the
                            captured and the captors. Among the stores of the Fox were sundry boxes
                            of choice wines and fragrant Havanas, and a generous stock of fresh
                            provisions had been laid in before leaving Grand Caillou. The voyage was
                            a pleasant one to all, and the ship, with a cargo worth half a million
                            of dollars, was turned over to the authorities at New Orleans, minus
                            drinkage, smokage, a little stealage and a number of souvenirs
                            distributed among "the boys" as mementoes of their first great naval
                            victory.</p>
                        <p>An interesting incident of the voyage was the recapture of the Fox by a
                            Government cruiser. The blue jackets had never been able to pick up the
                            sly varmint while she belonged to the Confederacy, but they gobbled her
                            on her way to New Orleans, within three days of her change of ownership.
                            One night a cruiser ran down across her <pb id="VAA3891-286" n="281"/>
                            bows and showed signals. Col. McMillan, not knowing what signals to show
                            in reply, kept steadily on his course. The next moment there was the
                            flash of a gun, and a thirty-two pound shot whistled close to the Fox's
                            chimneys. The engine was stopped immediately, and the Fox lay tossing
                            lightly on the gentle swell of the waves, while a boat from the cruiser
                            approached. A clean, natty little lieutenant climbed up the vessel's
                            side and made his way to the cabin. "Who is in command of this vessel?"
                            he inquired.</p>
                        <p>He was directed to the colonel, who had buttoned his coat over his portly
                            person, and with sword and sash on, was prepared to receive company.</p>
                        <p>"I'll trouble you for your sword," said the lieutenant, politely.</p>
                        <p>"Oh no. I hardly think that will be necessary," replied the colonel.</p>
                        <p>"Why not?" suggested the naval hero.</p>
                        <p>"I am a Federal officer," replied the colonel, "and this vessel is my
                            prize." The lieutenant took a rapid inventory of the colonel's
                            appearance, took in the gilt buttons, the red sash, and dwelt on the
                            texture of his cloth. He then inquired, in a somewhat bewildered
                            manner:</p>
                        <p>"What navy do you belong to?"</p>
                        <p>The colonel smiled audibly, and explained that he was only in the navy
                                <hi rend="i">pro tem.</hi>&#151;that he was colonel of the
                            Twenty-first Indiana volunteers, but, seeing an opportunity of doing a
                            good thing, he <pb id="VAA3891-287" n="282"/> thought he might as well
                            take it in, notwithstanding it was out of his line.</p>
                        <p>The lieutenant was evidently chagrined to think that the coveted prize
                            which had so often slipped through the fingers of the blockading fleet,
                            had at last fallen into the hands of a land lubber, but he was too much
                            of a gentleman not to congratulate the colonel on his luck and pluck,
                            and after taking a glass of wine and a cigar, he got into his little
                            boat and left, wishing the Fox a prosperous voyage.</p>
                        <p>If Colonel McMillan had belonged to the navy, instead of the army, the
                            capture of the Fox would have netted himself something handsome in the
                            way of prize money. As it was, he got nothing but glory, and not much of
                            that.</p>

                        <p>B<hi rend="sc">ENEATH</hi> an enormous magnolia, almost smothered with
                            climbing vines, about one mile from Baton Rouge, I found myself early in
                            June. Our location was a beautiful one, and if the romance had not been
                            so effectually thumped and bumped out of me, by twelve months of
                            soldiering, I might have been in raptures over our surroundings. We had
                            noble old sweet gums and magnolias, with the blue canopy of heaven to
                            sleep under, and natural arbors of wild vines to keep off the dews. The
                            glorious moonlight sifted, and "dropped and lifted," <pb
                                id="VAA3891-288" n="283"/> and the tremulous wooing of the gentle
                            south wind "soothed us night and day," but there were collateral
                            incidents and accidents of the situation that detracted sorely from its
                            romance. The mocking-bird, and other feathered songsters, twittered and
                            warbled among the branches, and bright-colored finches flashed in and
                            out of the green clusters, but the trail of the lizard was over all.
                            Green and ghastly to the eye; cold, slimy, and snaky to the touch, they
                            chased each other recklessly up and down the trunks, laid in a half
                            torpid state of flatness, or hung stupidly by their heel, with their
                            throats puffed out, looking like soap-bubbles, emitting a shrill,
                            piping, foggy sort of a whistle. And these exasperating little reptiles
                            were always dropping. You could not lie down for a brief after-dinner
                            nap, but the first lizard that discovered you made it a point to drop.
                            If he happened to miss his aim, he took you on his way back, and either
                            crawled up your leg or slid rapidly over your face, and up the trunk.
                            Beside lizards, we had ticks&#151;reed ticks and wood ticks, and dog
                            ticks, antics, critics, and tic doloreux. However much our suttler might
                            feel disposed to discourage a credit business, no obtrusive placard of
                            "No tick here," could be found anywhere in camp. And then the bugs;
                            there were round bugs, and flat bugs, and oblong bugs, and spiral
                            bugs&#151;humbugs and bugaboos&#151;bugs emitting a deadly
                            stench when, as invariably happened, they procured themselves to be
                            crushed.</p>
                        <p>We came to that camp on the Ist of June. General <pb id="VAA3891-289"
                                n="284"/> Williams (God bless that remarkable old brick) had been
                            seriously annoyed by a band of about one hundred mounted guerrillas, and
                            having but three regiments and two batteries with him, sent for the
                            Twenty-first Indiana, Thirtieth Massachusetts and Ninth Connecticut, to
                            come up and help him clean them out, according "to the order of combat."
                            I am inclined to look upon the order compelling us to go there as a
                            judgment of Providence upon our pride. We had not seen our beloved
                            brigadier for a long time. We had been well treated at Algiers, were
                            doing the government some service, had almost forgotten the "order of
                            combat," and began to entertain some respect for the service and for
                            ourselves. In short, we began to "feel our oats," and the righteous
                            judgment of Heaven overtook us.</p>
                        <p>Upon arriving at Baton Rouge, according to precedent, we were obliged to
                            remain on ship-board until the Nutmeg regiment was quartered. We sent up
                            to the general's quarters to ask permission for a detachment to go on
                            shore and cook for the regiment, there being no facilities on board. The
                            amiable chieftain informed us that no one would be allowed to go on
                            shore. Going ashore to cook meant going ashore to steal. The Western
                            regiments in his command had done nothing but pillage since they had
                            been in the service. He had no confidence in them. They did not come up
                            to the standard.</p>
                        <p>It would require more time and patience than I have at hand, to express
                            the utter detestation of that man by the Western men under his command.
                                <pb id="VAA3891-290" n="285"/> From the first day of his connection
                            with us, he had done nothing but insult, libel and oppress the three
                            Western regiments that had had the misfortune to be placed under him,
                            resorting to petty annoyances, of which even our eighth corporal would
                            be ashamed, to render our position uncomfortable. His policy seemed to
                            be that of treating everybody well except the soldiers of his command.
                            As to the charge of pillaging, there had been but little foundation for
                            it in any of the regiments under his command, and less among the Western
                            regiments than any other.</p>
                        <p>Colonel McMillan, of the Twenty-first Indiana, was severely, though not
                            dangerously, wounded. He went at night ten or twelve miles into the
                            interior, with a detachment of four hundred men, to prevent the burning
                            of some cotton, and to try and bag a few of the mounted marauders who
                            ranged between our place and Camp Moore. The Colonel, Major Hayes,
                            Adjutant Latham, and one or two others being mounted, rode ahead of the
                            detachment, and surrounded the house of an old man named Roberts, known
                            as the headquarters of a guerrilla band. There were five guerrillas
                            inside, armed with double-barreled shot-guns. As the colonel rode up,
                            old man Roberts and his two sons came to the door and fired five shots
                            at him. One of the young Roberts fired first, when Colonel McMillan drew
                            a pistol and shot him through the head, killing him instantly.</p>
                        <p>The old man, after discharging both barrels of his gun, attempted to
                            escape through a back door, <pb id="VAA3891-291" n="286"/> but was fired
                            at by Major Hayes, when he fell flat on his face and lay perfectly still
                            until secured. Col. McMillan was struck five times&#151;two balls
                            entered his left hand between the knuckles, and passed through; one
                            penetrated the arm above the wrist, ranged upward toward the elbow and
                            lodged between the bones; one struck in the left breast, just over the
                            heart; and the other in the side. The shot in the breast spent its force
                            in the clothing and wadding, and did not penetrate; the wound in the
                            side had an ugly look, but on examination proved to be not so serious,
                            the ball having ranged backward without penetrating the cavity. The
                            colonel's horse received six buckshot in his neck. After being wounded,
                            the colonel rode about three miles on horseback, when a carriage was
                            procured, and he was conveyed to town, impatient of the prospect of
                            being laid up for a time. He said he would not have minded being touched
                            a little in battle with a soldier's weapon, but hated to be picked off
                            like a jack-rabbit, with a shot gun.</p>
                        <p>The expedition brought in over one hundred bales of cotton, which were
                            piled up in the woods, waiting to be burned. They found, also, a great
                            deal already burning.</p>
                        <p>Of the pieces captured by our regiment near Algiers, at Bayou des
                            Allemands, and at other points, a battery of flying artillery was
                            organized, to be permanently attached to the regiment, under the command
                            of Lieut. James M. Brown, of Bedford, Ind. The battery was thoroughly
                            equipped <pb id="VAA3891-292" n="287"/> with confiscated mules, and
                            manned entirely from our own regiment.</p>
                        <p>In times of peace the South was governed pretty much as the North, by its
                            politicians and moneyed men, but it was a mistake to suppose that in war
                            time, the planters, the bankers, and the merchants were mainstays of the
                            rebellion. In the excitement of the revolution, the puppets changed
                            places with their masters, and the South was then governed by a mob.
                            Mechanics, laborers, jack-leg-lawyers and quack doctors, livery
                            stable-keepers, whisky-sellers, gamblers, and "poor white trash," were
                            the bitterest and most uncompromising rebels. If there was any Union
                            feeling in the South&#151;any lingering regrets for the glory of the
                            old flag, and the good old times of peace and plenty&#151;it was to
                            be found among the planters and merchants. Many of the planters and
                            moneyed men would have been content with anything&#151;even gradual
                            emancipation&#151;to insure peace and security; but they lived in
                            constant dread of guerrilla vengeance, while at the same time they were
                            threatened with Federal confiscation. The less a man had at stake, the
                            longer he held out.</p>
                        <p>That which was most trying to a man's patience was the senseless babble
                            about Northern amalgamation and negro equality. There did not exist on
                            the face of the earth a community where open, shameless amalgamation was
                            practiced to a greater extent than in the Cotton States. There was not a
                            plantation in the South but bore witness to the truth of this charge.
                            The son of the planter, if at <pb id="VAA3891-293" n="288"/> all curious
                            upon the subject of relationship, could generally find half-brothers and
                            sisters among his father's chattels; and by the time the "young master"
                            attained his twentieth year he was pretty sure to have contributed
                            something towards the universal bleaching out of the ultra-Ethiopian
                            features from the faces of the next generation of slaves. Bachelor
                            planters lived openly with black and parti-colored paramours, in
                            defiance of public opinion, if there was any public opinion to defy. If
                            married, it was the same thing, only, in deference to the unreasonable
                            scruples of his white wife, the concubine was sometimes kept out of the
                            house, and supported in a state of almost regal splendor at another
                            plantation. Merchant princes, law-givers, statesmen, and the high
                            dignitaries of the land had their little weaknesses in the same
                            direction. The most alarming features in this state of affairs was the
                            countenance it received from society. There was no outcry, but all was
                            taken as a matter of course. The press and the pulpit ignored the facts,
                            however notorious; and the courts were never troubled with divorce cases
                            in consequence. In the North, if a man lived openly with a black woman,
                            no respectable white woman would look at him, much less speak to him;
                            but in the South, a young blood would come from the embraces of a
                            saddle-colored mistress to the parlor or ball-room, and was received
                            with smiles by the elite of Southern society.</p>
                        <p>There existed throughout the South, more particularly in Louisiana, a
                            class of people known as creoles. The word creole, comes from the
                            Spanish <pb id="VAA3891-294" n="289"/>
                            <hi rend="i">crolls</hi>&#151;a native&#151;and is properly
                            applied to the native-born "foreign" population. For instance, a child
                            born of French parents in Louisiana, will be a creole Frenchman. If the
                            parents were Spanish, a creole Spaniard, etc. It was also applied to
                            native articles of produce, as creole butter, creole eggs, creole hay,
                            etc. But in the North a creole was generally understood to be a person
                            of mixed blood. This was not so far out of the way, as matters stood,
                            for every mongrel negro, who managed to get hold of money or property,
                            called himself or herself a creole, and society, ever complaisant and
                            charitable when humbug is backed by brass and gold, winked at the
                            deception which deceived nobody, and the negro chrysalis straightway
                            became a creole butterfly. Many of the early Spanish settlers, their own
                            "blue-blood" of Castile, impoverished by the admixture of the viler
                            Morisco current, amalgamated with their slaves. The law of Louisiana did
                            not recognize such a thing as an "illegitimate child," and the Spanish
                            planter, dying intestate, the fruits of his black amours&#151;a
                            mixture of Spanish, Moorish, and negro blood&#151;came in for a full
                            share of the estate, and they and their children became creoles. A
                            planter lives for years with a mulatto or a quadroon, and, on dying,
                            bequeaths to her free papers and a handsome fortune. She ceases to be a
                            negro, and gradually becomes a creole. These creoles, by grace, as all
                            mongrel races are, are cruel, cowardly and treacherous, and when owning
                            slaves themselves, are the most inhuman masters or mistresses. No <pb
                                id="VAA3891-295" n="290"/> conception of avarice and meanness could
                            be formed until a sugar or cotton plantation, owned by one of these
                            spurious creoles, had been visited.</p>
                        <p>The real creole is a different creature. He is gay, gallant, avaricious,
                            and shrewd in driving a bargain, neat and cleanly in personal
                            appearance&#151;brave for the time, but incapable of the heroism of
                            endurance&#151;sociable, when it costs him nothing&#151;making a
                            great show of hospitality and practicing little&#151;knowing little,
                            and caring less for public affairs&#151;a rebel or loyal citizen,
                            just as interest dictated&#151;holding allegiance first to France,
                            next to the State, and not caring a cent either for the United States or
                            Confederate States. He is a creole&#151;nothing more. A creole can
                            live upon less, and make a better show than anybody else. He can get the
                            better of a Yankee clock peddler in a trade, and teach a Wethersfield
                            onion-raiser practical lessons in economy.</p>
                        <p>Southern bravery has been greatly overrated, even in the North. The men
                            of the South&#151;those whose blood has not been tainted with Moor,
                            Indian, or negro&#151;faced death as readily as those of the North,
                            but they had not the same power of endurance. They cried constantly,
                            "You can never subdue us," and yet I never saw a people so easily
                            subdued. Put one of them in a tight place, and all manliness forsakes
                            him. It is true the South has been the theater of many desperate deeds,
                            but these usually took the form of cold-blooded assassinations. A
                            Southern "gentleman," whose wealth and position stand between him and
                            the <pb id="VAA3891-296" n="291"/> law, is wronged, or thinks he is
                            wronged, by another, not his equal in standing. He coldly calculates his
                            chances, and if he can make out a good case, decides on "satisfaction."
                            With nine buckshot in each barrel of his heavy deer-gun, a brace of
                            derringers in his pocket, and a bowie-knife buckled around his waist, he
                            meets his victim, perhaps unarmed and suspecting nothing. He cries,
                            "Defend yourself," and immediately discharges both barrels, in quick
                            succession, into the body of his adversary. By telling the victim to
                            defend "himself," even though he might be unarmed, and the roar of the
                            shot-gun blends with the last word of the sentence, the affair is
                            divested of the character of assassination, and rendered perfectly
                            honorable in Southern eyes.</p>

                        <p>B<hi rend="sc">ATON</hi> R<hi rend="sc">OUGE</hi> is one of the prettiest
                            places in the South. It contained three or four or five thousand
                            inhabitants. The streets were pleasantly shaded with live oak, box and
                            China trees, and the gardens were tastefully decorated with flowers and
                            flowering shrubs. The capitol, on the bank of the river, a fine-looking,
                            showy building, but like a great many other Southern institutions, on
                            close inspection, proved to be a sham. The grounds were elegant and well
                            kept. The city boasted of barracks <pb id="VAA3891-297" n="292"/> and
                            arsenals, built by the United States, a fine-looking college of some
                            sort, and a penitentiary, which was not as well patronized as it ought
                            to have been. The morals of Baton Rouge were particularly rigid in
                            outward appearance, but probably about as lax beneath the surface as
                            those of Washington.</p>
                        <p>General Williams went up the river, taking with him all the troops except
                            the Twenty-first Indiana and Sixth Michigan, and left Colonel McMillan
                            in command of the post.</p>
                        <p>Towards the middle of July, Colonel Keith, with detachment of forty
                            mounted men, penetrated <unclear>-ome</unclear> thirty miles into the
                            enemy's country, smoked out a guerilla camp of eighty or an hundred men,
                            surprised them and captured all their equipage, horses, and killed a
                            number in the affair. Returning at night, Colonel Keith's party were
                            themselves waylaid at a bridge over the Amite river; lost two soldiers
                            and a negro guide, while a number of others were wounded.</p>
                        <p>Cassell, the leader of the guerillas in that part of the State, was
                            captured, together with two of his officers. From a friendly contraband,
                            some of our troops learned that the guerilla chief was in the habit of
                            visiting his plantation near the city, and by concealing themselves
                            about the place, his capture was effected. He was forwarded to New
                            Orleans to be dealt with by General Butler. If ever a scoundrel deserved
                            hanging, it was this man, Cassell. He brought great trouble on the
                            people of this place (Baton Rouge.) When the Federal <pb
                                id="VAA3891-298" n="293"/> fleet made its appearance in front of the
                            city, and a boat was sent ashore to treat for its surrender, Cassell, at
                            the head of a body of mounted marauders, galloped down to the water's
                            edge and fired on the boat, killing some and wounding others. This, of
                            course, drew the fire of the gunboats on the city, and broadside after
                            broadside was fired up the streets, into the principal buildings and
                            away over the town into the woods, among the crowds of flying
                            citizens.</p>
                        <p>Cassell had given no notice of his intention to provoke hostilities, and
                            the town was full of non-combatant citizens, women and children. A
                            terrible panic ensued. The halt, the lame, the blind, frail women and
                            children, and half-frantic negroes, joined in a hurried flight to the
                            woods. Some died in the streets of pure fright, and children were
                            prematurely born in the adjoining fields, amid the roar of artillery and
                            the bursting of shells. Negroes at work in cane or corn-fields two or
                            three miles back of town, were startled by the dropping of the hissing
                            globes among them, and fled in dismay, firmly believing the end of the
                            world was at hand. For days, little children, separated from their
                            parents, roamed through the woods, half-starved, nearly eaten up by
                            mosquitoes, and frantic with terror. For all this, Cassell was
                            responsible, and richly deserved to be hung.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the stringent orders against harboring contrabands, quite
                            a number wormed themselves into our camp, and were employed as cooks and
                            servants. Some of them gave us val <pb id="VAA3891-299" n="294"/> uable
                            information, and it would not only have been cruel, but ungrateful to
                            have turned them over to the tender mercies of the rebels.</p>
                        <p>There was a great deal more cotton in the country than was at first
                            supposed. Much was burned, but large quantities, stowed away in secret
                            places by the owners, came to light.</p>
                        <p>Gen.&#151;somebody or other, I forget who, was reported, on good
                            authority, as advancing on Baton Rouge, with a mongrel horde of from
                            five to seven thousand men. Col. McMillan had a force of seven hundred
                            contrabands felling trees on the spot of wooded ground southwest of the
                            penitentiary, and thus prepared for the reception of our distinguished
                            visitor.</p>
                        <p>There had been a cry of "wolf, wolf," until the belief among our boys was
                            pretty general that the wolf was only a sheep, and a very shabby one at
                            that. But by the time we had gotten through with him, we had come to the
                            conclusion that he was a "right smart" wolf after all. The enemy came in
                            from the direction of Camp Moore, on the morning of the 5th of August,
                            1862, and encountered our pickets a mile out on the Greenville Springs
                            road, about three o'clock a. m. There they halted and made their
                            dispositions for the attack. Just at daylight they advanced in three
                            divisions, one by the Bayou Sara road, one by the Greenville Springs
                            road, and one by the Perkins, or Claggut road. The attack was planned
                            with skill, and carried out with great spirit, the rebel regiments
                            charging with shouts and cheers right up to our batteries. On <pb
                                id="VAA3891-300" n="295"/> our side the Twenty-first Indiana, the
                            Sixth Michigan, and the Thirtieth Massachusetts, did the fighting. The
                            Fourteenth Maine broke and ran at the first fire, and never re-formed. A
                            few of their number fell in with our regiment, and fought well.</p>
                        <p>The Fourth Wisconsin and Ninth Connecticut were not under fire. The
                            Seventh Vermont did excellent service for the enemy, in the way of
                            firing into our regiment from the rear, by which we lost a number of
                            men. Manning's battery, Everett's battery, Nim's battery, and our own
                            mule battery, did excellent service. So much by way of a summary.</p>
                        <p>Our regiment was stationed in the center, about a mile from town, on the
                            Greenville Springs road, with the Fourteenth Maine on our left, and the
                            Sixth Michigan on our right. When it became evident that an attack was
                            imminent, our regiment, Lieut. Col. John A. Keith in command, was
                            marched out on the Greenville Springs road about six hundred yards, and
                            took up position behind a rail fence, thickly covered with a growth of
                            Cherokee rose, enclosing a corn-field on the right of the road, with an
                            open field and the cemetery in the rear. The whole surface of the
                            country was covered with a dense fog, through which it was impossible to
                            observe anything at the distance of a few rods. We had taken position
                            behind the fence but a few moments, when a rebel force was heard
                            advancing on our right, having marched across from the Claggut road. In
                            the meantime a rebel force had stealthily approached through the
                            cornfield <pb id="VAA3891-301" n="296"/> in our front, and were in the
                            act of crossing the fence not fifteen paces in front, when we gave them
                            a deadly volley, which had the effect of driving them back in confusion,
                            leaving the field covered with their dead and wounded. At the same time
                            we were fired into from the right flank, and the sound of heavy and
                            continuous firing on our left, in the direction of the Bayou Sara road,
                            indicated that we were in danger of being flanked there. Col. Keith
                            ordered the regiment to fall back, which it did, and again formed in
                            line of battle in the rear of the cemetery, the men lying flat upon
                            their faces. At this time a portion of the Michigan Sixth, which had
                            abandoned their position on the Claggut road, came up and formed on our
                            right. At this point I first saw Gen. Williams, who rode along the line,
                            exhorting the men to stand firm and do their duty.</p>
                        <p>The enemy, advancing through the grave-yard, delivered a volley which
                            passed over us. We then rose from the ground and fired with deadly
                            effect. At the same time, the Michigan men became engaged on our right,
                            and did excellent service; but the force on our right, engaged in the
                            flanking movement, was too heavy, and, by an oblique fire, again caused
                            a retrograde movement. By this oblique fire, Lieutenant Charles D.
                            Seely, of Company A, was killed. He was a brave and gallant officer, and
                            was shot through the heart while at the head of his company. He fell
                            forwrard on his face, and at the same moment, his orderly sergeant, <pb
                                id="VAA3891-302" n="297"/> John A. Bevington, was shot through the
                            head and fell across his feet.</p>
                        <p>Retreating through our camp in column of companies, the left in front, we
                            again formed in line along the street at the upper end of the camp, when
                            a regiment was seen advancing in column at double quick, considerably in
                            advance of us, on the right, along the opposite street. Through the dust
                            and fog, we could not distinguish them, and Colonel Keith rode half way
                            across the space between and hailed&#151;"What troops are those?"
                            "Secesh as h&#151;ll," was the answer, followed by a volley from our
                            regiment which left the road piled with their dead. A volley from at
                            least two thousand pieces was then fired upon us from the rear, the part
                            of which, fortunately, passed over our heads. We then retreated down the
                            street under a heavy fire, counter-marched and came up the next street,
                            and formed in line on our parade grounds, where the heaviest fighting
                            took place. During this retreat, we were fired into by the Seventh
                            Vermont.</p>
                        <p>The enemy, in the meantime, had taken possession of our camp, and burned
                            the tents about half way up the line. Two regiments were drawn up to
                            oppose us in the woods between our camp and the parade ground, while on
                            our left flank a company of sharpshooters, armed with Colt's revolving
                            rifles, were picking off our officers. After the interchange of several
                            volleys, by a brilliant charge, assisted by a portion of the Thirtieth
                            Massachusetts, which came opportunely to our aid, our regiment drove the
                            enemy pell-mell through the woods <pb id="VAA3891-303" n="298"/> and
                            entirely out of our camp, saving just half of it from pillage and
                            burning. In this last contest, Gen. Williams and M. A. Latham, our
                            adjutant, were killed, and Col. Keith severely wounded.</p>
                        <p>Write nothing but good of the dead. I have nothing to retract that I have
                            written of Gen. Williams, except such charges as impugn his courage. He
                            was as brave a man as ever lived, and died cheering us on to victory.
                            Just before he received the fatal shot, he apologized to Col. Keith for
                            his treatment of our regiment, and paid it the highest compliment for
                            bravery and coolness in action. But Gen. Williams lacked the
                            qualifications of a commander.</p>
                        <p>"The noblest Roman of them all," Matthew A. Latham, of Cincinnati, was
                            the <hi rend="i">beau ideal</hi> of a soldier, and a man without the
                            slightest conception of fear. There was scarcely a brigadier general in
                            the army possessing the qualifications of this man, filling the humble
                            position of adjutant. He fell from his horse, pierced with four balls in
                            his body, and a grape shot, which struck him just under his nose,
                            passing entirely through, and making a horrible wound. And yet, with all
                            these wounds, he rose from the ground and walked twenty or thirty paces,
                            until death overcame him, and his gallant spirit took its flight. He was
                            a man of fine social instincts, and shrewd, common sense, as well as
                            military qualifications. A strict disciplinarian, and a terror to all
                            violators of military law; he still enjoyed the universal confidence and
                            esteem of both officers and men. God keep the memory of this <pb
                                id="VAA3891-304" n="299"/> gallant, warm-hearted Irishman forever
                            green in our hearts!</p>
                        <p>Another gallant soldier and noble officer, Major Hays, was wounded
                            severely early in the action, and had to be carried from the field.</p>
                        <p>Colonel McMillan, not having recovered from his wounds, was unable to
                            take command. He rode out on the field, but was compelled, through sheer
                            exhaustion, to return.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Keith manifested the utmost bravery and coolness until wounded.
                            He was wounded severely in the shoulder and slightly on the chin.</p>
                        <p>After Colonel Keith and Major Hays were wounded, Captain Roy being sick,
                            the command of the regiment devolved on Captain James Grimsley. The
                            captain was as brave as a lion, and as cool as a cucumber. Although
                            wounded himself, after having the wound dressed, he took command of the
                            regiment.</p>
                        <p>The different batteries of artillery, our own mule battery among the
                            number, did excellent service. They poured in destructive charges of
                            canister and grape at ranges in distances less than thirty yards. Many
                            of the men supporting the batteries were wounded with buckshot.</p>
                        <p>From wounded prisoners I learned that the force of the enemy consisted of
                            twelve regiments, numbering from five to seven thousand, under the
                            command of Breckinridge, Clarke and Ruggles. They were Kentuckians,
                            Mississippians and Louisianians, the most of them armed with Springfield
                            and <pb id="VAA3891-305" n="300"/> Enfield rifles. They expected
                            assistance from the ram Arkansas, afterwards sunk by the Essex.</p>
                        <p>Our regiment went into action less than five hundred strong, and lost in
                            killed and wounded I26&#151;26 killed, 98 wounded and four missing.
                            This was pretty heavy for a two-hours' engagement, and I think much
                            heavier than any other regiment engaged. The loss of the enemy was
                            generally put down as three times as great as our own, though I think
                            that statement a little exaggerated.</p>
                        <p>The regiments opposed to us were all veterans, who had fought at Shiloh
                            and other battle-fields. They frequently exchanged volleys with us at a
                            distance of thirty paces.</p>
                        <p>The gunboats could do but little in the fight on the 5th. The
                            battle-field was so far from the river they could not fire without
                            danger of doing more harm than good. But when the enemy were driven
                            back, the gunboats threw shells over the town into their midst. A
                            sentinel on one of the State house turrets, with a glass, signalled to
                            the boats the direction, distance and range of the enemy, and some of
                            the shots thus made were said to be very fine.</p>
                        <p>Of the rebel army, General Clark, Colonel Allen, and Captain Frepannier
                            were said to have been mortally wounded. The town was full of wounded
                            rebels in private houses, besides those in our own hospitals.</p>
                        <p>For days after the battle, all our information pointed to a renewal of
                            the fight on the part of the rebels, with heavy reinforcements. There
                            was <pb id="VAA3891-306" n="301"/> something going on above that we did
                            not exactly understand. Whether Vicksburg had been evacuated, or the
                            attempt to reduce it abandoned by the Federal troops, we could not say,
                            but our leaders were satisfied that Van Dorn had reinforced Breckenridge
                            since the fight, and that they were determined to see if they could not
                            improve on their attempt of the 5th of August.</p>
                        <p>After the death of General Williams, Col. Payne, of the Fourth Wisconsin,
                            was in command of the post. Col. Payne possessed the entire confidence
                            of the command.</p>
                        <p>Our lines were drawn in, and the entire force massed in the neighborhood
                            of the old United States barracks. With a force of nearly a thousand
                            contrabands, we fortified our position, threw up breastworks, dug rifle
                            pits, and cleared away obstructions in the way of our fire. At night our
                            boys pitched into the work themselves, and worked like beavers until
                            after midnight. Looking at the magnitude of the works, it seemed like an
                            absolute impossibility that so much could have been accomplished in less
                            than twenty-four hours. But everybody was expecting an attack before
                            mornirg, and both contrabands and soldiers worked hard. All night
                            nothing was heard but the sound of the pick and shovel, and the dull,
                            heavy "thud" of the packing mules, beating down the loose earth. About
                            two o'clock our pickets were fired on, and the whole force repaired to
                            the trenches, where they remained until breakfast time without seeing
                            anything of the foe.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3891-307" n="302"/>
                        <p>I was an officer of the guard the night before the fight. When our
                            pickets were driven in, and it became evident the enemy was advancing in
                            force, the guard, which was a tolerably heavy one, was marched out with
                            the battalion. After the first fire the guards were ordered to join
                            their several companies. Not particularly fancying the idea of being
                            shot at, with no means of offensive operations save and except a sword
                            as guiltless of edge as a crowbar, I borrowed a gun from a wounded man,
                            and fell in with Capt. Jim Grimsley's company, my own company having
                            been detached from the battalion to support a section of Everett's
                            battery, in another part of the field.</p>
                        <p>Captain Grimsley's company having its full complements of lieutenants in
                            the field, I was left, in a measure, free to take notes and watch for an
                            opportunity to "plug" a "reb." I heard a deal of noise, and occasionally
                            got a glimpse of a "butternut" among the corn, but the fog was so dense,
                            and the smoke so thick that I could not draw a satisfactory "bead."
                            Finally, a regiment of the enemy, somewhat out of latitude, was seen
                            marching down an opposite street, a little in advance of us. We received
                            orders to fire, and I succeeded in covering a rather "natty" looking
                            officer, mounted on a splendid horse. I fired. After the smoke cleared
                            away, a riderless horse was seen galloping madly down the street, and I
                            was inclined to think there was room for promotion among the staff
                            officers of that battalion.</p>
                        <p>The enemy were most splendidly armed with <pb id="VAA3891-308" n="303"/>
                            Enfield and Minnie rifles, throwing balls of English manufacture, with
                            the box-wood plug in the base. The passage of these balls close to one's
                            head was followed by the most infernal hissing sound it is possible to
                            imagine. Sometimes they seemed to me to be endowed with vitality, and
                            possessed of the most fiendish spirit of vindictiveness. Then again they
                            reminded me of geese following you in the road&#151;not dangerous,
                            but exasperating.</p>
                        <p>But the most singular thing, and one which I do not remember to have
                            heard mentioned heretofore, was the effect of these balls upon the
                            atmosphere through which they passed. The passage of one immediately
                            across your face was followed by a momentary sensation of deathly
                            sickness. The air seemed thick, stifling and putrid, like that of a
                            newlyopened vault, accompanied by an odor of certain kinds of fungii
                            found in the woods, and never willingly disturbed by either man or
                            beast. I should like to know if any one else has felt this, or if it was
                            a peculiar fancy of my own.</p>
                        <p>The rebels were provided with percussion shells, fashioned like those
                            used in our rifle cannon. It was supposed that they were intended for
                            exploding caissons.</p>

                        <p>F<hi rend="sc">ROM</hi> the time they left Camp Moore, the rebels were
                            subsisted by private contributions from citizens along the way. Wagon
                            loads of provisions were hauled for miles on either side of the road.
                            Yet many of them got nothing. The haversacks of a number of those left
                            dead on the field were filled with a miscellaneous collection of food;
                            biscuits, "pones" of corn bread, fried chicken, cakes of clabber-cheese,
                            etc. In the lower edge of our camp I found a large, fine-looking rebel,
                            with an intelligent countenance, and a fine, silky beard, lying flat on
                            his back with his arms thrown out, and a rifle shot through his neck,
                            just under the ears. In coming through the camp of the Fourteenth Maine
                            he had secured a loaf of soft bread, and thrust it into his bosom. I
                            have no doubt he was hungry, and the loaf bore marks of his fingers
                            where he had pinched off and eaten mouth-fulls during the heat of
                            battle. There are times when, in contemplation of the most trivial
                            things, the strongest man will be overcome with the weakness of a child.
                            I had just passed a rebel, torn to shreds with a twelve-pound shell, and
                            lying a bloody, loathsome, and shapeless mass, without a shudder; and
                            yet the sight of this poor devil, with his nibbled loaf, almost unmanned
                            me.</p>
                        <p>During the hottest of the fight, I came upon a <pb id="VAA3891-310"
                                n="305"/> woolly head, deployed as skirmisher, and with the muzzle
                            of an Enfield protruding from behind a large magnolia tree. He fired
                            just as we filed past, and rolled over on his back to reload. "What the
                            d&#151;l are you doing there?" said I. "O, nothin' sah; only doin' a
                                <hi rend="i">little picketin</hi>'", was the answer, with the utmost
                                <hi rend="i">sang froid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A most dastardly attempt was made to assassinate Col. Dudley, of the
                            Thirtieth Massachusetts, on the night of the battle. He was giving
                            instructions to some of our sentinels, when he was fired upon from one
                            of the houses with an air gun, the ball passing close to his head.</p>
                        <p>We had a drummer boy with us, who had the most remarkable faculty of
                            getting into scrapes, and the most remarkable luck in getting out of
                            them. On the day of the fight, Charley, in company with another drummer,
                            got a gun and started out on his own hook. With his usual brilliant
                            strategy, Charley managed to insinuate himself between ours and a
                            Confederate regiment, and had quite a lively time in "changing front,"
                            as the storm of bullets might be coming from one side or the other. In
                            the meantime, Charley and his comrade managed to get in a few shots
                            edgewise, and finally escaped unhurt. The most amusing thing was
                            Charley's description of the sickly sort of laugh with which he and his
                            comrade tried to keep up each other's spirits.</p>
                        <p>After the fight was over, Charley went back to camp to see about his
                            "traps," and managed to be <pb id="VAA3891-311" n="306"/> taken
                            prisoner. A Confederate lieutenant catechised him after the following
                            manner:</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant&#151;You d&#151;d little cuss, what the&#151;are
                            you after here?</p>
                        <p>Charley&#151;I want my knapsack.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant&#151;How many of you d&#151;d Yankees are there?</p>
                        <p>Charley&#151;I don't know.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant&#151;You have an idea; guess.</p>
                        <p>Charley&#151;Between ten and twelve thousand.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant&#151;Don't lie to <hi rend="i">me,</hi> you little rascal,
                            (drawing a revolver) I'll shoot you in a minute. Now tell me the
                            truth.</p>
                        <p>Charley&#151;I really don't know. (After a pause.) How many men have
                            you?</p>
                        <p>The rebel looked for a moment as if this was too much for human nature to
                            bear. Then he faced Charles about, gave him a tremendous kick in the
                            rear, and told him to "git."</p>
                        <p>The Yankees were jealous of the part taken by an Indiana regiment in the
                            fight, and ashamed of their own. Consequently, every cursed "Nutmeg,"
                            from the highest to the lowest, persisted in misrepresenting us. General
                            Butler, as the head of the New England Division, felt bound to favor it
                            as much as possible. At the same time I do him the justice to say that
                            he did not misrepresent us, except by implication. He only did us
                            injustice by mentioning us in the same connection with regiments who
                            eternally disgraced themselves, and the uniform they wore. The New
                            Orleans papers were edited by Yankees. One of them stated editorially
                                <pb id="VAA3891-312" n="307"/> that General Williams was killed
                            while trying to rally the Twenty-first regiment, which was thrown into
                            dismay. A "passenger" from Baton Rouge (probably a Yankee sutler,
                            running away from the prospect of another fight,) informed another of
                            those Yankee editors that General Williams was killed while cheering on
                            our men to retake a gun which they had lost. The simple facts were
                            these: General Williams, after denouncing the Fourteenth Maine and
                            Seventh Vermont as "sheep," publicly complimented our regiment as the
                            only one which had not been broken and scattered. At one time Brown's
                            mule battery, supported by Michigan troops, was compelled to abandon one
                            gun, the last charge of canister from which was fired at a body of rebel
                            troops <hi rend="i">not twenty paces distant;</hi> but the brave
                            Michigan boys soon drove the enemy away, and gallant Jim Brown saved his
                            gun. From this gun five gunners were shot down at one fire. It was
                            stationed at least half a mile from where General Williams fell. This
                            "passenger from Baton Rouge" failed to state, while on the subject of
                            guns, that Company F, of the Twenty-first Indiana, three times manned a
                            section of Everett's battery from its own ranks, and hauled off the guns
                            by hand when the horses were shot down, and also that Indianians hauled
                            off a section of Manning's battery by hand after it had been abandoned.
                            The honest truth was just this,: The Fourteenth Maine broke at the first
                            fire, and never reformed. They had twenty-six men killed and seventy or
                            eighty wounded, without firing more than one volley, <pb
                                id="VAA3891-313" n="308"/> which they fired in the air. The
                            Confederates shot them down as we used to shoot rabbits in Illinois.</p>
                        <p>The Seventh Vermont fired into us. They had a few men killed and wounded
                            by bullets that first passed through our ranks. When ordered to move up
                            to our support, they failed to do so, and many of them broke and ran to
                            town. While the Twenty-first Indiana, the Sixth Michigan, the Thirtieth
                            Massachusetts, and the artillery were fighting the battle, a lot of
                            cowardly wretches were down in the town plundering houses. The Fourth
                            Wisconsin and Ninth Connecticut had no opportunity of engaging in the
                            fight.</p>
                        <p>Long after the battle, we were occupied, working in the trenches in the
                            day time and sleeping in the trenches at night, scouting, picketing,
                            foraging, evacuating, moving and re-moving. After working hard and
                            faithfully for more than two weeks, and burning down a part of the town
                            to give our artillery good range, Col. Payne had just got Baton Rouge in
                            a defensible position, when the order came from New Orleans for its
                            evacuation. The Ocean Queen, a large, sea-going steamer, took on four
                            regiments, and the remainder of the troops, munitions and supplies, were
                            placed on different river transports, and on the morning of the 20th of
                            August, the whole fleet set sail down the river, under escort of the
                            gunboats, with the exception of the iron-clad Essex, which remained at
                            Baton Rouge to prevent the rebels from occupying and fortifying the
                            town. It was a <pb id="VAA3891-314" n="309"/> sad and yet an exciting
                            scene to see that long string of puffing steamers, crowded with
                            soldiers, creeping away from a position which could have been maintained
                            at all hazards. But I presume the men were needed more elsewhere than
                            there. The morning before we left Baton Rouge a considerable force of
                            rebel cavalry and infantry, probably under the impression that our
                            forces had been already withdrawn, came to our outposts and attacked our
                            pickets. Our gunboats opened a furious fire, which sent them back in the
                            direction of the Comite a little faster than they came. (The Comite is a
                            small stream ten miles back of the city.)</p>
                        <p>It was reported that one shell from the Mississippi, killed seventeen
                            skedaddling rebels. The following incident is vouched for: A Michigan
                            boy had strayed beyond the lines, foraging for poultry. Four mounted
                            rebels came out of a cornfield and fired their carbines at him. Michigan
                            drew up his gun and shot one of them dead. Then fixing his bayonet, he
                            charged the other three, and put them to flight. Our first landing was
                            at Camp Parapet. This camp was behind an immense earthwork, extending
                            some two or three miles in length, back to the swamp, thrown up by the
                            rebels against an invasion from the north. Phelps, with a force of mixed
                            troops, was encamped. We pitched our tents in a cornfield, where the mud
                            was almost knee deep, and stayed there two or three days, during which
                            our Western men were constantly embroiled with negroes and "Nutmegs." At
                            Camp Parapet, I saw what I had often heard of <pb id="VAA3891-315"
                                n="310"/> but never expected to see&#151;an entire regiment of
                            slaves, regularly organized and drilled&#151;to the best of their
                            ability.</p>
                        <p>There was a great deal of speculation as to whether or not the negro
                            would fight. I had not the slightest doubt that, if properly
                            disciplined, they would fight&#151;perhaps a good deal better than
                            some of the New England troops did in the affair at Baton Rouge. It
                            would not have been healthy for any of them to be taken prisoners. But
                            fight or no fight, a negro who has served any length of time as a
                            soldier will prove an invaluable acquisition to the morals of a sugar
                            plantation.</p>
                        <p>After the death of General Williams, a new brigade was formed, composed
                            of the Twenty-first Indiana, Fourth Wisconsin, and Fourteenth Maine,
                            with Colonel Payne as acting brigadier. If they had given us the Sixth
                            Michigan in the place of the Fourteenth Maine, the arrangement would
                            have been complete. Although the Fourth Wisconsin could, by seniority,
                            have claimed the first position, Colonel Payne, in consideration of the
                            services of the Twenty-first, gracefully waived the claims of his
                            regiment, and gave us the right, with the Wisconsin on the left, and the
                            Maine in the center. Colonel Payne possessed not only the entire
                            confidence, but the love and esteem of all the Western men of the
                            department. He was a thorough soldier, a gentleman and a scholar, and if
                            he could only have sworn a little once in a while, I would have
                            considered him perfect.</p>
                        <p>After our regiment left Algiers and went to Baton <pb id="VAA3891-316"
                                n="311"/> Rouge, the guerillas in the western parishes and along the
                            banks of the river carried matters with a high hand. A Vermont regiment,
                            which succeeded us at Algiers, proved itself totally incapable of
                            dealing with them, having had its scouting parties repeatedly drawn into
                            ambush and severely cut up. At one time two whole companies, with
                            artillery, were captured, and a day after, a party sent out to learn
                            their fate was drawn into ambush and nearly annihilated. A party from
                            our regiment went out, drove the guerillas from their camp, and
                            re-captured a large number of Vermont wounded men.</p>
                        <p>On a Sunday, having heard of a large force of infantry, cavalry and
                            artillery up the river, in company with detachments from the Fourteenth
                            Maine, Fourth Wisconsin and Ninth Connecticut, and the sloop-of-war
                            Mississippi, about four hundred of our regiment started after them, on
                            the steamers Morning Light, St. Maurice, Laurel Hill and General
                            Williams (late Burton.) When in the neighborhood of the Red Church, we
                            accidentally stumbled on Waller's battalion of Texas cavalry. One-half
                            of our force was landed below and the remainder above, and scattered in
                            detachments; we began beating up the cane and rice-fields to set the
                            game afoot. The division that I was with marched back toward the swamp
                            through the rice-fields, and took position in ambush in a narrow lane,
                            the fences of which were overgrown with high weeds. We had been there
                            but a few moments, with skirmishers thrown out well towards the swamp,
                            when we <pb id="VAA3891-317" n="312"/> heard a rattling volley from the
                            rest of our regiment, between us and the river. The volley was
                            occasioned in this manner: A man named Douglas, of Company G, had
                            straggled from the detachment, and was pursued by the mounted Texans
                            with fierce shouts. Poor Douglas was making wonderful time, but it was
                            not in nature for a man to outrun a horse, and consequently his pursuers
                            were gaining upon him rapidly, and were brandishing their long, heavy,
                            heathenish knives, in anticipation of soon bagging him, when suddenly
                            companies B and G arose from the grass and fired, killing the entire
                            party, horses and all. One of them was literally shot to pieces, having
                            five balls through his head and seven through the chest. The three
                            unfortunates who were killed were part of a scouting party, the main
                            body being farther back toward the swamp. The fate of the three alarmed
                            the party, and they were seen galloping through the cane about a quarter
                            of a mile to the right of where our detachment was stationed. A party of
                            the men were sent out, who failed to cut them off, but killed one and
                            made two prisoners.</p>
                        <p>The Mississippi, by means of her lookout at the masthead, was able to
                            distinguish the rebels among the cane fields, and threw a few shells
                            with great precision, which, besides killing and wounding several, added
                            greatly to the mortal terror of the rebels.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime the main body of the rebels, as yet in blissful ignorance
                            of our force and resources, drew up in line of battle along a road about
                            half a <pb id="VAA3891-318" n="313"/> mile to the left of our position,
                            and out of reach of the Mississippi, with the intention of hazarding a
                            fight. Throwing out skirmishers to the right and left, with the Jackass
                            battery in front, we advanced along a cross-road until within six
                            hundred yards of their position. An open field, overgrown with tall,
                            rank weeds, all matted together with a web of wild pea vines,
                            intervened. The whole formed a dense jungle, through which a hare could
                            scarcely force her body; and yet this was the kind of territory over
                            which our boys had the felicity of illustrating the beauties of the
                            skirmish drill.</p>
                        <p>Our guns opened on the enemy with shell and canister, and they broke in
                            the utmost terror. Prisoners afterward told us that they were unaware
                            that we had any artillery, and were taken completely by surprise when
                            the shells and canister began flying through their ranks.</p>
                        <p>From this time the affair became little more than a rabbit hunt. The
                            greater part of the rebels fled to the swamp, but some of them scattered
                            among the weeds in the fields. These were hunted out and shot or taken
                            prisoners. The road to the swamp was strewn with a miscellaneous lot of
                            clothing; saddle-bags, gourd-canteens, pistols, knives, swords, hats,
                            coats, shirts, powder-kegs, hospital stores, and everything possible to
                            be cast loose in a desperate fight. Haversacks, rudely made of coffee
                            sacks, and filled with corn bread, onions, sweet potatoes and fried
                            chicken, lined the road on either side. Some of the canteens, picked up
                            by our boys, let loose, when the cork was removed, <pb id="VAA3891-319"
                                n="314"/> a familiar smell of "spirits," but no Texan would ever for
                            a moment think of sacrificing such an utensil, even in the moment of
                            wildest panic, as long as a drop remained. Hair lariats, vast spurs,
                            with rowels as large as a silver dollar, buckskin moccasins, cap-boxes
                            made of sea-beans, and all outlandish things possible for a Texan ranger
                            to own, also paved the way.</p>
                        <p>His education, who has never seen a Louisiana swamp, is vastly
                            incomplete. He has lived with no adequate conception of what Webster
                            means when he defines desolation, gloominess, sadness, destitution.
                            Desolation means a Louisiana swamp. For further information inquire
                            within. Familiar as I have been, in former times, with these vast
                            swamps, during hunting and fishing excursions, I extended my
                            acquaintance at that time; I went further into the swamp than I had ever
                            been before&#151;I went in up to my neck. How far my horse went, I
                            can not say. The last time I saw him he was still going in. Into the
                            swamp rode the six hundred, as if the very d&#151;1 was after them;
                            and into the vile swamp, among the moccasin snakes, we followed them.
                            For two miles or more we floundered through the mud and water, picking
                            up a squad of "tuckered" out rebels here, shooting another one there.
                            All along, the swamp was covered with horses, bogged down and unable to
                            move, and some of them with their entrails torn out in contact with the
                            sharp cypress needles which abounded in all the swamps. For miles these
                            horses, a great many of them fine ones <pb id="VAA3891-320" n="315"/>
                            too, were there found. The best horses carried their riders the farthest
                            into the morass. We got out a number of them, shot such as were snagged
                            with the needles, and left the others to their fate. Coming out of the
                            swamp, it would have puzzled any one to have told an officer from a
                            private, or a white man from a negro. We were cased in a thick coat of
                            mud, which having dried, gave us something the resemblance of plaster
                            statues. Altogether we made a rather poor affair of Waller's battalion.
                            They were a fine-looking, greasy, dirty, ragged, savage, cut-throatish
                            set, but splendidly mounted and equipped. Every man had a shotgun,
                            carbine or short musket, from one to two fine revolvers, and a large
                            outlandish knife or cutlass two feet in length, from two to four inches
                            broad, and weighing from two to four pounds.</p>
                        <p>We killed some twelve or fourteen rebels, took twenty or thirty
                            prisoners, and captured fully four hundred horses. The horses were good,
                            and some of the equipments elegant. From papers captured, we learned
                            that Waller's battalion were regularly mustered into the Confederate
                            States' service, the men having equipped themselves at an average cost
                            of three hundred and thirty dollars. If they did not perish in the
                            swamp, and ever succeeded in getting together again, it cost them a
                            trifle to refit. Reports of the battle of Baton Rouge came back to us,
                            and excited no little merriment. "Lord, lord, how this world is given to
                            lying!" The fact was, it was a hard fight, and we came out a little the
                            best. The gunboats rendered no assistance <pb id="VAA3891-321" n="316"/>
                            whatever. The rebels did not bayonet our wounded, nor did they fire on
                            them as they were brought in. The enemy did not even temporarily occupy
                            and burn our camp. They began to burn, but got no farther than the third
                            row of tents. The point on our right, where the majority of reports made
                            Nim's battery perform prodigies of valor, was occupied by Jim Brown's
                            Jackass battery.</p>
                        <p>The comments of the Indianapolis <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> and Chicago
                                <hi rend="i">Tribune,</hi> on the death of General Williams, were
                            not in the best taste, though literally true. If anything could have
                            justified them, however, it was the sickening eulogy which was heaped
                            upon his memory after his death. The truth was, Williams was universally
                            detested by the threeWestern regiments under his command. So far from
                            being the accomplished soldier he was represented, he either had no
                            military talent or failed to manifest it. Although in possession of
                            certain information that an attack would be made on the morning of the
                            fifth, he made no preparation whatever to meet it, but suffered the camp
                            of the Twenty-first Indiana to remain in its old position, advanced
                            entirely beyond the line, or where the line should have been formed in
                            "order of combat style." During the battle he seemed to be without a
                            purpose. Just after the Seventh Vermont fired into us, he sent an order
                            to Colonel Keith to fall back to the penitentiary. Colonel Keith swore
                            furiously, and utterly refused to obey, saying that Williams was not
                            fool enough to send such an order. Just then Williams rode up, and Keith
                            asked him if he had sent such <pb id="VAA3891-322" n="317"/> an order.
                            "Yes," said Williams; "but I believe I was mistaken." Then the order was
                            given to charge, and Williams fell, but <hi rend="i">not</hi> as the the
                            papers had it, while rallying the Twenty-first Indiana.</p>

                            of military promotion, and from a lieutenant became a brigadier general,
                            was organizing an expedition for the Attakapas country. Gen. Weitzel's
                            expedition was to land at Donaldson-ville, and march down the Bayou
                            Lafourche; but for some time Donaldsonville and the neighboring country
                            had been infested with audacious and daring rebels, who, notwithstanding
                            the gunboats, made the navigation of the Mississippi particularly
                            uncomfortable, and cotton and sugar-stealing expeditions extremely
                            hazardous. The powers that be had a little curiosity to know the force
                            and resources of the Donaldsonville rebels, and Col. McMillan, who was
                            tolerably sure of being called on when anything enterprising or dashing
                            was to be done, was commissioned to make a reconnoissance. With a force
                            of about four hundred men from the Twenty-first, with the Jackass
                            battery under command of Lieut. Brough, and a couple of gunboats in the
                            river, we effected a landing at <pb id="VAA3891-323" n="318"/>
                            Donaldsonville, on the 21st of September, 1862. On the 22d and 23d, we
                            made short excursions down the bayou on the lower side, encountering and
                            driving in the rebel pickets.</p>
                        <p>On the 24th, ascertaining that the principal force was stationed on the
                            upper side of the bayou, Col. McMillan, with three hundred men and the
                            three field pieces, started down that side. In the meantime, he had
                            learned through reliable sources, that the rebel forces in the
                            neighborhood numbered over a thousand, but, with our battery, we were
                            vain enough to think our three hundred men a match for them. Proceeding
                            down the bayou, driving the rebel pickets before us, when in the
                            neighborhood of the Cox plantation, and about three miles from the
                            river, we found a little more than we bargained for in the shape of
                            Semmes' battery This was one of the finest light batteries in the
                            Confederate service, consisting of six rifled brass six-pounders. It
                            opened upon us a furious, well-directed, and well-sustained fire, which
                            was promptly and spiritedly replied to by our battery. Finding that they
                            had the advantage of us in range, Lieut. Brough limbered up, and took a
                            new position within six hundred yards of his opponent, when the
                            artillery duel was renewed.</p>
                        <p>Taking a fancy to the Confederate pieces, Colonel McMillan ordered a
                            charge to take them at the point of the bayonet. The men, who were
                            shielding themselves from the well-directed fire behind the levee,
                            promptly fell in, and impatiently awaited the order to charge, when
                            Colonel McMillan discovered <pb id="VAA3891-324" n="319"/> a heavy force
                            of cavalry galloping through the cane-fields with the evident intention
                            of cutting us off from the river. This somewhat changed the face of
                            affairs, and a retreat was ordered and conducted in an orderly but
                            rather hasty manner. I was a considerable distance in advance of the
                            battalion with a party of skirmishers. The day was most infernally hot,
                            and with my brains frying and sputtering in my head, almost completely
                            exhausted, with my skirmishers, I began a laborious retreat through the
                            thick cane-rows and tangled pea-vines. Gradually the boys began to
                            disappear in front, and the prospect of my getting through became
                            involved in disagreeable uncertainty; yet I do not think I would have
                            been taken were it not for the appearance of my evil genius in the shape
                            of an old gray horse, which a native was leading out of the cane. He was
                            a most unpromising animal, whose sands of life had nearly run out, rough
                            and shabby in coat, unsymmetrical in shape, and afflicted with sundry of
                            the ills to which horseflesh is heir; but I thought he might have life
                            enough in his venerable bones to carry me out of a bad scrape. I made
                            the native help me on him, and then go ahead and let down the bars so I
                            could get out on the bayou road. I struck my heels vigorously into old
                            gray's ribs and whaled him with the end of a rope, but could not get
                            anything better out of him than a deliberate walk. As I was slowly
                            working him up to the fence, already entertaining serious doubts as to
                            the remunerative nature of my horse speculation, my native called to me
                            in barbarous French to go <pb id="VAA3891-325" n="320"/> back to the
                            cane, as the Philistines were coming up the road. I evacuated my horse
                            in strong disgust, and clambered over the high plank fence to get into
                            the cane. In getting over, I caught my foot on the top and fell all of a
                            heap, giving my back a violent wrench. I, however, limped along until I
                            found the enemy were between me and our men, and then laid down in the
                            cane, thinking I would wait until the excitement was over, and then make
                            my way back to the river. I do not know how long I laid there, but it
                            seemed to me nearly a week. I could hear our battery away off near the
                            river blazing away at the rascals, and occasionally the shrill scream of
                            our gun-boat shells. Finally, all became quiet, and I began to think of
                            make another start, when I heard the galloping of cavalry near me. I
                            again laid down, hugging the the earth close, and making myself as thin
                            as possible, but keeping a lookout towards the direction from which they
                            were coming. Presently the head of a squadron of the sons of Belial
                            emerged and filed past my place of concealment, down the "turning row,"
                            on their return from pursuing our fellows.</p>
                        <p>The party had nearly all passed, and I began to think they would not see
                            me, when a little, red-capped cuss in the last file, instead of going
                            about his business, looking neither to the right nor left, did look to
                            the right, and caught a glimpse of my blue blouse among the green leaves
                            of the cane. Wheeling his horse around he took another look, then cocked
                            his double-barreled shot-gun, and invited <pb id="VAA3891-326" n="321"/>
                            me to "come out o' that," an invitation I did not feel at liberty to
                            decline. I came out and gave up my arms, when a lively dispute arose
                            between my captor and one of his companions as to whose "Yankee" I was,
                            each claiming that he had seen me first. I began to fear that I should
                            suffer the fate of the unfortunate Miss McCrea in the dispute between
                            the two Indians, and that unable to decide which of them should have me,
                            they would agree to <hi rend="i">halve</hi> me, and each take a part.
                            Finally one of them took me up behind him, and I was carried to
                            headquarters, feeling exceedingly sheepish, with a strong inclination to
                            sell out of the service at less than cost.</p>
                        <p>The headquarters were in a large frame dwelling taken from Mr. Cox, a
                            Union man. There I found Col. Vincent, a little, spectacled man, with a
                            Jewish cast of countenance; Lieutenant Colonel Mc Waters, a fine
                            looking, red faced old gentleman, kind and generous in conduct, but
                            fierce as a tiger in battle; and various line officers, whose names I do
                            not remember.</p>
                        <p>I was paroled not to attempt an escape, and kindly treated, but awfully
                            bored with questions, which, however, I was told I need not answer
                            unless I wanted to. I also met Capt. Semmes and Lieut. Fauntleroy, of
                            the battery. Semmes was a slight, sallow-faced, volatile man, apparently
                            not more than twenty-one years old, a son of "Sum-ter" Semmes, then
                            commanding the Alabama. I felt a good deal of curiosity to see him, as
                            we were already acquainted with his battery-having <pb id="VAA3891-327"
                                n="322"/> had the benefit of a formal introduction at Baton Rogue.
                            Fauntleroy was a fine-looking, amiable, red-headed young fellow, with a
                            most amusing "stutter" in conversation.</p>
                        <p>The men all had a curiosity to see and talk with the prisoner, so much so
                            that Col. McWaters placed a guard at the door to keep them from annoying
                            me to death. One of them, who had failed to get a sight at the show,
                            came up after a while and stood outside the door, saying nothing, but
                            looking at me curiously. Col. Vincent passed by, and asked him what he
                            wanted. He said he wanted to see the Yankee. "Want to see a Yankee, do
                            you?" said the Colonel, "Well take forty rounds of cartridge and go up
                            to Donelson." The fellow grinned his appreciation of the joke, but
                            didn't seem to want to see the Yankees bad enough for that.</p>
                        <p>On the morning of the 26th, I was started for Camp Pratt, on Bayou Teche,
                            in charge of Lieut. Chamberlain. We landed at New Iberia about an hour
                            before day, a little town with dirty streets, and a strong sheepy smell.
                            After daylight a buggy was procured, and, through a long lane, which had
                            more than one turning, I was conveyed to Purgatory, which, in the
                            language of the country, was called "Camp Pratt," a camp of conscription
                            and instruction, six miles from New Iberia, and fifty miles from the
                            Bay. The camp itself was a collection of plank "wedge-tents," with here
                            and there small editions of the stars and bars flapping their greasy
                            folds in the breeze. I was taken before <pb id="VAA3891-328" n="323"/>
                            Col. Burke. Col. Burke was the "big Injun" of Camp Pratt.</p>
                        <p>I was turned over, properly receipted for, and then, after taking a
                            formal leave of Lieut. Chamberlain, who had treated me very kindly, I
                            was escorted to the prisoners' quarters, where one hundred and
                            thirty-seven Yankees, taken at Bayou des Allemands, were confined. I was
                            not naturally a lover of Yankees, but, "Fiat Justitia," though the
                            heavens fall. These were the meanest Yankees I ever saw. Of course there
                            were honorable exceptions, but I never saw as much petty meanness and
                            selfishness in my life as I witnessed among them. They annoyed me, and
                            disgusted me more completely than anything I saw in rebel-dom. The
                            officers, however, were very clever but one of them was the most
                            inveterate Yankee I ever met. He had been five years in the regular
                            army, and still his enunciation of "cow" would have insured him "a long
                            cord and short shrift" in the days of Kansas border ruffianism. He
                            always called me <hi rend="i">"How-sier,"</hi> and really seemed to
                            enjoy the wit of the thing so highly that I could not find it in my
                            heart to get angry with him. I contrived, however, to let him know in
                            the course of our acquaintance, that so far from being ashamed of being
                            a Hoosier, I was proud of it, and that I did not agree with him in
                            believing that the hub of the universe was located in New England.</p>

                        <p>T<hi rend="sc">HERE</hi> I also found Connelly and Cox, our two
                            lieutenants, who were captured in May last. Poor fellows! They had been
                            confined for three months and fifteen days in Opelousas jail before
                            coming to Camp Pratt. Camp Pratt was filled with Cajunn conscripts. I
                            will try and tell what a Cajunn is. He Is a half-savage creature, of
                            mixed French and Indian blood; lives in swamps, and subsists by hunting
                            and fishing and cultivating small patches of corn and sweet potatoes.
                            They are sallow, dried up, and mummy-like in appearance, and stolid and
                            stupid in expression. The wants of the Cajunn are few, and his habits
                            simple. With a bit of corn-bread, a potato, and a clove of garlic, with
                            an occasional indulgence in stewed crawfish, he gets along quite
                            comfortably, and for luxuries, smokes husk cigarettes and drinks
                            rum-when he can get it. The Cajunn has great powers of endurance, but
                            not much stomach for fight. Of the herd at Camp Pratt, desertions were
                            quite frequent, sometimes as many as thirty or forty stampeding in a
                            single night. But they would be caught, brought back, made to wear a
                            barrel for a week or two, and were finally broke in.</p>
                        <p>I can not say that we were abused by the Cajunns. They did not insult,
                            but exasperated us dreadfully. In the cool of the evening, they would
                                <pb id="VAA3891-330" n="325"/> gather about our quarters, and stand,
                            or sit squatted on their haunches, for hours, not saying a word to us or
                            to each other, but regarding us with a grim, stupid stare, reminding me
                            strongly of the manner in which the lower class of Choctaws, in the
                            Indian country, sit and gaze at a circus bill.</p>
                        <p>Seven of us were stowed in one tent&#151;a dirty, greasy pen, densely
                            populated with vermin. We had three blankets among us, and as northers
                            would occasionally blow up, one might imagine our sleep was not "balmy."
                            We had about a quarter of an acre of ground for one hundred and forty
                            persons to exercise upon, with a guard of one Cajunn, with a
                            double-barreled shot-gun, to every fourteen feet of ground. For food, we
                            had yellow cornmeal, beef, and sugar, issued to us, with the alternative
                            of cooking it ourselves or eating it raw. The Yankees boiled the beef,
                            and made a thick mush of the meal, which they called pudding. Boiled
                            beef is the meanest thing on earth, except half-cooked, yellow mush. I
                            ate the mush for three or four days, until my stomach utterly revolted,
                            and an attempt to eat it was followed by the most violent retching. Then
                            I subsisted on beef alone for a time. To tell the truth, I came near
                            being starved. The ghost of every good dinner I ever ate in my life,
                            haunted my weary slumbers. The shade of a mince pie, which an esteemed
                            lady friend had sent me years ago, was particularly obtrusive. After
                            feasting upon all manner of delicacies and substantials in my troubled
                                <pb id="VAA3891-331" n="326"/> sleep, I would wake to the
                            realization of captivity, and the cussed mush and beef.</p>
                        <p>Camp Pratt was short of crockery, and the boys, for plates, used all
                            sorts of contrivances, so that they frequently ate their mush from
                            pieces of gourd calabashes, the shoulder-blades of deceased oxen and
                            other unique vessels.</p>
                        <p>While the men had money they would buy milk at twenty-five cents a quart;
                            eggs, fifty cents per dozen; sweet potatoes, four dollars per bushel; a
                            twelve-ounce loaf for fifty cents, etc.; but after they had eaten up
                            their knapsacks, haversacks, canteens, and, in some instances, their
                            shoes, they had to return to mush and beef. As for me, I had no money,
                            and as nobody offered to lend me any, I had a full course of the
                            nutritious diet alluded to. Connelly and Cox were in the same fix, The
                            only time when we departed from the bill of fare was when we devoured
                            Connelly's watch.</p>
                        <p>In justice to the Camp Pratt officers, I must say they gave to us just
                            what they did to their own men. Indeed, I generally found them willing
                            to oblige us, when in their power. One might naturally imagine the days
                            at Camp Pratt were long and irksome. The entire literary resources of
                            our party amounted to an old magazine, a Dutch dictionary, a Catholic
                            prayer-book, in French, and a well-worn edition of "Robinson Crusoe."
                            Robinson was good for thirty or forty perusals, but after that became a
                            little stale.</p>
                        <p>Connelly and Cox, having been nearly five months in captivity, and seeing
                            no signs of ever <pb id="VAA3891-332" n="327"/> being released,
                            concluded to risk the fearful chances of a journey through the swamps,
                            to escape. Knowing more than they of the horrors of a Louisiana swamp, I
                            tried to dissuade them; but, finding them determined, I resolved to risk
                            my fate with theirs. One dark night they both succeeded in getting away,
                            but I was stopped by the guard. This I regarded at the time as another
                            exemplification of my constitutional ill-luck; but I soon had occasion
                            to look upon it as the only good luck I ever had in my life. The very
                            next day after the skedaddle, we learned that we were to have been sent
                            to Vicksburg, to be paroled, and in a week we went. Connelly and Cox, I
                            afterwards learned, after suffering unheard-of hardships from cold,
                            hunger and venomous insects, were recaptured at Donaldsonville, utterly
                            barefooted, and with bleeding, mangled feet.</p>
                        <p>From the time of leaving Camp Pratt, we fared well. Captain Rensaw, or
                            Ransom, who had us in charge, treated us very kindly. We came down the
                            Teche and up Achafalaya, on the "Cricket," to the mouth of Red river,
                            and from thence on the "Louis d'Or" to Vicksburg. This was the channel
                            of communication between Richmond and Louisiana, or Texas, and the
                            Government boats did a lively trade in sugar and beef. The batteries at
                            Port Hudson and Vicksburg kept all that portion of the river between the
                            two places open.</p>
                        <p>At Vicksburg we remained two weeks. The officers were paroled for a
                            certain portion of the city, and boarded at the Washington Hotel, at an
                            expense <pb id="VAA3891-333" n="328"/> of $4.00 per day each to the
                            Confederate government. There I was treated with much kindness and
                            courtesy by Confederate officers, many of whom offered to lend me money.
                            Everywhere the utmost confidence in the success of their cause was felt.
                            The fortifications at Vicksburg had been greatly strengthened, and were
                            then regarded as invulnerable. The construction of the Yazoo iron-clads
                            proceeded slowly, but, from what I learned incidentally, they would
                            prove more formidable than any they had ever had. The Confederates
                            expressed the highest admiration of Rose-crans, but said that McClellan
                            was our best general. They said that if he had had Western men in his
                            army they could not have cleaned him out so easily. They thought Buell a
                            dangerous man. For Pope they had the most supreme contempt, and they
                            thought they were too sharp for any of Sigel's Dutch tricks.</p>
                        <p>We came down from Vicksburg under a flag of truce. Our regiment was out
                            at Berwick's Bay. They manned the gun-boats in the fight at the mouth of
                            Teche, and lost five men killed. Lieutenant Wolfe, of Company H, was
                            killed, and Lieutenant Fisher, of Company A, lost both his legs by the
                            premature explosion of a shell. Our boys made excellent gunners. They
                            could do anything&#151;cavalry, artillery, engineering or navy work,
                            as well as infantry. Our colonel, however, always fancied that he
                            belonged to the navy.</p>
                        <p>Another change now took place in post commanders. Between King's Log and
                            King's Stork, <pb id="VAA3891-334" n="329"/> we were in a fair way of
                            becoming as heartily sick of change as were the frogs in the ancient
                            fable. The new commander&#151;General Philip St. George
                            Cook&#151;dawned upon us, and immediately began to "fix things."
                            Cotton in large quantities, heretofore concealed, was freely exchanged
                            for the necessaries and luxuries of life.</p>
                        <p>There were twenty regiments of the <hi rend="i">Corps d' Afrique,</hi> at
                            Port Hudson, and more were to be organized. A year before, one would as
                            soon thought of drowning himself as of taking a position in a negro
                            regiment. That service, however, became quite popular, and a number of
                            the Twenty-first Indiana became officers therein.</p>
                        <p>November 7, 1863, our cavalry scouts encountered a small mounted force of
                            the enemy, about six miles out on the Clinton road, and it was reported
                            to be the advance of a heavy force, of course. Enemy's loss, two hundred
                            and twenty-one killed, wounded, and driven back-principally driven back;
                            our loss trifling.</p>

                            were more favorable for something to transpire at our end of the river.
                            The rebels, sensible of the absurdity of attempting to protract the war
                            with the Mississippi in our possession, seemed <pb id="VAA3891-335"
                                n="330"/> to be meditating a bold stroke to establish a permanent
                            blockade, either by fortifying a new point, like that of Fort Adams, for
                            instance, or by the recapture of Port Hudson.</p>
                        <p>Gen. Dick Taylor was reported to have crossed the Atchafalaya in force,
                            and established himself on the Mississippi, between Morganza and the
                            mouth of Red river, with the intention, as some supposed, of capturing a
                            steamer and crossing over to the other side.</p>
                        <p>The Emerald was fired on one morning, at Hogg's Landing, on her way down,
                            by a battery of six and twelve-pounders. The boat had anchored in a
                            heavy fog during the night, about six hundred yards from the shore. She
                            had aboard about five hundred soldiers, including Company M, First
                            Indiana Artillery, and convalescents from the Thirteenth Army Corps. The
                            fog beginning to lift in the morning, the captain had the anchor
                            weighed, preparatory to moving ahead, and just at this time the opposite
                            shore was discovered to be alive with gray-backs. Lieutenant McMillan,
                            of the First Indiana, being command of the boat, formed up such of his
                            men as were armed, about two hundred in number, and fired on the enemy.
                            The fire was immediately returned with artillery. Twenty-one shots were
                            fired in all, three taking effect; one in the hull, one in the cabin,
                            and one in the pilot-house. The shot in the pilot-house was a
                            twelve-pound shell, and in exploding, tore it to pieces and knocked over
                            the pilot, who, considerably stunned and bewildered, ran below, the <pb
                                id="VAA3891-336" n="331"/> boat in the meantime running ashore, and
                            making prodigious efforts to climb the bank. A soldier of the
                            Seventeenth Kentucky threatened to blow the pilot's brains out, and
                            drove him back to his post, when the boat was headed down stream and
                            steamed off, making better time than she ever made before.</p>
                        <p>The navigation of the Mississippi was a ticklish business at this time.
                            The steamer, Black Hawk, was fired on at about the same point where the
                            Emerald and others were riddled&#151;viz. Hogg's Landing. This boat
                            was terribly torn, while several were killed and others wounded. There
                            were ladies on board, but they escaped without injury. At Tyler, a large
                            number of our men, who had been made prisoners, were confined. Frequent
                            attempts were made to escape, which the rebels mostly prevented by
                            organizing a blood-hound <hi rend="i">corps</hi> to hunt them down.</p>
                        <p>The enemy, during the entire campaign, studiously avoided a general
                            engagement, but was active enough in making sudden dashes on exposed
                            detachments. Our generals, who made war according to rule, were
                            disgusted with the irregular tactics of the Confederates, who played
                            swordfish to the whale.</p>
                        <p>An Ohio regiment, captured in Burbridge's brigade, numbering over three
                            hundred, was said to have given at a recent election, two hundred and
                            fifty votes for Vallandigham. With such a record, no one could feel very
                            sorry for them.</p>
                        <p>The City Belle, chartered by Gov. Morton, arrived <pb id="VAA3891-337"
                                n="332"/> at Baton Rouge the last day of December, 1862, loaded with
                            sanitary stores for the Indiana soldiers of that department.</p>
                        <p>At that time, Baton Rouge and the woods and swamps of the interior, were
                            said to be swarming with refugees. Two causes operated to drive them
                            into our lines-the scarcity of food and the activity of the conscript
                            hunters. Many of those who came in, had laid for weeks and months in the
                            swamps, living on frogs, crawfish, and an occasional ear of corn.</p>
                        <p>In August, 1863, the thunders of war ceased at Port Hudson. I had been
                            absent for several months-in fact, had been sent on a fool's errand to
                            the darker portion of Indiana, and had received a fool's reward. I went
                            on business connected with the recruiting service, but few were the
                            recruits, and small were the demands made on the United States Treasury
                            for transportation of men from Martin county to the seat of war.
                            Returning too late to share the perils of the siege and the glory of the
                            final triumph, I must content myself with reviewing what others did.
                            Though nearly a month had elapsed since the surrender of that
                            stronghold, there were abundant evidences of the tremendous struggle of
                            our forces for possession, and the stubborn resistance of the
                            besieged.</p>
                        <p>Of the hundred pieces of artillery captured, scarce one but bore marks of
                            rough usage, in the shape of a shattered carriage, a split muzzle,
                            trunnions knocked off, or deep indentations in the side. Captain
                            Connelly, with two pieces, crossed the <pb id="VAA3891-338" n="333"/>
                            river below, and, cutting embrasures in the levee, soon dismounted all
                            their guns on the lower part of their river front, without losing a man,
                            or having had either of his guns disabled. Among them the large rifled
                            piece which sunk the Mississippi, and which had been a terror to our
                            fleet, went by the board.</p>
                        <p>I rode around the rebel works. They were seven miles in extent, and were
                            neither strong nor elaborate in construction. The rebels were indebted
                            to nature, rather than art, for the success with which six thousand men
                            so long and so successfully held out against the army of Gen. Banks. The
                            country around Port Hudson was cut up with wide and deep ravines,
                            intersecting each other at all sorts of angles. These ravines had
                            precipitous banks, and were filled with a wild mass of fallen trees,
                            tangled vines and undergrowth, through which it would seem a rabbit
                            could scarcely force its way. In riding around the line, a nice, smooth
                            place was occasionally seen, left invitingly open for a charge, but a
                            closer examination revealed the fact that it would not have been very
                            healthy to attempt the entrance. Masked batteries, enfilading pieces and
                            torpedoes, were ready to deat death and destruction on the advancing
                            columns. The Citadel, the rebel work, to the capture of which almost the
                            entire energy of the besieging forces was directed during the latter
                            part of the siege, and to effect which the celebrated sixteen-gun
                            battery was erected, proved to have been little more than an out-work,
                            so effectually commanded <pb id="VAA3891-339" n="334"/> by interior
                            works, that in the event of its being taken it could not have been held.
                            At the time of the surrender it had been sapped by the Michigan men, the
                            shaft entering a distance of eighty-five feet from the base.</p>
                        <p>From officers who participated in the siege, I learned a number of
                            interesting facts, which I do not remember to have seen anywhere else.
                            The various charges made upon the works did not seem to have been very
                            well managed. In the first charge, on the 27th of May, Sherman, at
                            first, refused to charge, alleging that it would be a useless
                            expenditure of life. General Banks sent a peremptory order to charge at
                            all hazards. Sherman did so, but was repulsed with fearful loss. In the
                            meantime, before Sherman started, the charge had taken place at other
                            points, and had been repulsed, and the rebels had concentrated on
                            Sherman's front. Payne's charge was well and gallantly executed, and
                            came nearer being a success. Dwight's charge was a miracle&#151;in
                            its way&#151;and was, no doubt, the most remarkable one on record.
                            It would certainly have been successful, but for the great distance
                            intervening between the advancing columns and the parapet, and the fact
                            that the nine-months' heroes became pretty well "tuckered out" just
                            about the time they got within two or three hundred yards of the rebel
                            works, within easy range of a light battery, which opened on them. Of
                            the infantry participating in these charges, the Fourth Wisconsin, Sixth
                            Michigan, and Second Duryea Zouaves have the best record. <pb
                                id="VAA3891-340" n="335"/> They were all terribly cut up, and
                            behaved most gallantly.</p>
                        <p>Guerrillas were again active, and gobbled up a party of wood-cutting
                            negroes, in plain sight of the State House. Then again, just across the
                            river, they made simultaneous attacks on government plantations on both
                            side, a little below Port Hudson, killing and wounding a number of
                            negroes. One of our gun-boats came down and shelled then off, taking
                            five or six prisoners. That is the only instance on record, I think, of
                            a gun-boat taking cavalry. The scoundrels did not observe the approach
                            of the vessel until they were covered by her guns, when they preferred
                            surrender to the risk of being ventilated with canister.</p>
                        <p>General Weitze's brigade went down the river and joined the expedition, a
                            part, at least, of which was on its way, having been heard from at the
                            Southwest Pass. The command of the post devolved upon Colonel John A.
                            Keith, of the First Indiana Artillery, who, notwithstanding his right
                            arm was entirely useless from the effects of the terrible wound he
                            received in the battle on the 5th of August, had been in command of his
                            regiment since April, and bore a conspicuous part in the siege and
                            reduction of Port Hudson.</p>
                        <p>From some of the soldiers on board, the Iber-villes, that came down early
                            in October, with badly wounded men of the Twenty-sixth Indiana, and a
                            few Confederate prisoners, I obtained an intelligible account of an
                            affair near Morganza, exaggerated rumors of which had reached us from
                            many <pb id="VAA3891-341" n="336"/> sources. The facts were that General
                            Herron, with a force of three or four thousand men, had been sent up to
                            Morganza, to amuse a Confederate force in that neighborhood and try and
                            hold them there until the Teche expedition, by advancing as far as
                            Vermilionville, would cut them off. General Herron, after landing at
                            Morganza and throwing out a force of five hundred men, of the
                            Twenty-sixth Indiana and Nineteenth Iowa, was relieved of his command by
                            General Dana, and ordered to report to General Banks. This force of five
                            hundred men, under command of Colonel Leake, of the Twenty-eighth Iowa,
                            was encamped between the main force and the Atchafalaya, which ran near
                            the Mississippi, at Morganza, had been engaged for a number of days in
                            constant skirmishing with the enemy, and was finally surrounded by an
                            overwhelming force, and, after a desperate fight had to surrender, with
                            a loss of fourteen killed and over forty wounded. The fight was
                            represented by those who participated in it to have been of the most
                            obstinate and deadly character. Col. Leake was badly wounded. After the
                            fight, the Confederates, under command of General Greene, of Texas,
                            hastily retreated, leaving all our wounded (with the exception of the
                            officers, whom they carried off) upon the field, with three of our
                            soldiers, who were unhurt, to take care of them. They did not offer to
                            parole our wounded or the nurses left with them, but hastily covered up
                            their own dead, and took their wounded to the other side of the
                            Atchafalaya.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3891-342" n="337"/>
                        <p>One section of the Second Missouri Battery was also captured. There was a
                            small cavalry force along with the command of Colonel Leake, which cut
                            its way through the enemy, and reported to General Dana at Morganza,
                            who, with forces drawn up in line behind the levee, seemed to be quietly
                            awaiting the issue of the conflict going on in his front.</p>
                        <p>The town of Morganza&#151;a small collection of antiquated frame
                            houses&#151;was burned by our troops, who were intrenched behind the
                            levee, and under the protection of the gun-boats, awaited an attack from
                            a force said to number ten thousand. Morganza was in Morgan's Bend, a
                            few miles above Bayou Sara.</p>
                        <p>The Confederates held a strongly fortified position at Camp Bisland,
                            where a desperate stand might have been made; but it was so situated,
                            geo-graphically, that a force coming in from above could have cut them
                            off completely. Fearing this, they removed their cannon and destroyed
                            their works as soon as they discovered the formidable nature of the
                            force gathered at Brashear, and moved further up the country.</p>

                        <head>THE MISSION OF AN AEROLITE.</head>
                        <p>One of the most phenomenal deaths that ever was known, occurred in the
                            vicinity of Newtown, Fountain county, this State, on Tuesday night.
                            Leonidas Grover, a farmer, while asleep in his bed, was instantly killed
                            by an aerolite, which came from some unknown quarter of the universe,
                            flying through space with fearful velocity. It tore <pb id="VAA3891-345"
                                n="340"/> a ragged opening through the roof directly above Mr.
                            Grover's breast, crashed through his body, through the bed and the floor
                            beneath, and buried itself five feet in the earth. Its weight was twenty
                            pounds. What time the mysterious missile came, no one knows. Mr.
                            Grover's daughter and her husband, who constitute the family with whom
                            he resided, were away during the evening. When they returned at a late
                            hour, the house was still. They retired, and did not learn of Mr.
                            Grover's death until the next morning, when, as he did not come to
                            breakfast at his usual time, his daughter went to call him. The position
                            of the dead man when found showed that he had been asleep when the
                            curious messenger of death met him, and that his death had been
                            instantaneous and painless.</p>
                        <p>Death has many avenues out of life; but none have heretofore been
                            discovered so mysterious, so full of sad speculation, and so certainly
                            proving that "no man knoweth when the king shall come." Of all ways of
                            leaving the world this is one that never could have occurred to Mr.
                            Grover. He lay down peacefully in his bed, in the house that had
                            sheltered him safely for years, without a thought of danger, and while
                            he slept a missile more deadly than the thunderbolts of Jupiter, a
                            projectile hurled by the very gods, as it were, from some planet
                            millions of miles away, came straight as an Indian's arrow through space
                            and struck him lifeless. He was an upright and God-fearing man, and had
                            no enemies to dread; no avenger to fear. His life had been calm and
                            simple. He had joyed in the <pb id="VAA3891-346" n="341"/> few homely
                            pleasures that surrounded him. He had watched the seasons come and go
                            with sweet contentment. When he lay down that fateful evening he had no
                            premonition of the dreadful thunderstone which was flying through space,
                            bearing his death-warrant. He dreamed, perhaps, as he slept, but only of
                            happy hours that were safe in the impregnable past, and not of the grim
                            angel whose wings shadowed him, for his face still bore the trace of
                            smiles, and was untouched by a line of anguish. On, on came the
                            aerolite, hissing through space with a momentum so terrific it can
                            scarcely be computed; its aim as certain, its purpose as deadly as
                            though propelled by some invisible but superhumanly intelligent power.
                            It struck Mr. Grover as he slept and dreamed, and the spark of his life
                            was quenched. The mission of the mysterious missile was accomplished.
                            Its journey through infinite space was finished. It buries itself in the
                            earth, and the heat of its anger and the force of its fury are spent. It
                            is no longer a messenger from another world, charged with a tragic
                            commission, but a part of our earth, passive and inanimate, compelled to
                            remain so until some grand change is made in the solar system of which
                            this planet is a part.</p>
                        <p>Many have been the theories advanced to explain the phenomena of
                            aerolites or meteorolites. That they are mineral masses of
                            ultra-terrestrial origin, fallen to our earth, is now the accepted
                            theory; though as meteoric astronomy is yet in its infancy, the true
                            source of their origin and the causes <pb id="VAA3891-347" n="342"/>
                            which impel them to this planet are yet, perhaps, to be discovered and
                            made plain. It is estimated that at least five thousand separate
                            aerolites fall every year, and as many as six or seven hundred meteoric
                            showers take place over the surface of the earth in the same time.
                            Sometimes one or two single masses fall, and sometimes a shower of two
                            hundred or more stones is distributed over several acres or miles;
                            sometimes dust accompanies the shower, and sometimes dust falls alone.
                            Chladni propounded the now generally accepted theory with regard to the
                            origin of aerolites. He affirmed that there are more comets and smaller
                            bodies flying about in space than there are fishes in the ocean. The
                            velocity of aerolites is more than triple that of a body simply falling
                            through infinite space. That would travel at the rate of six or seven
                            miles per second, while aerolites have a planetary velocity, some of
                            them even overtaking the earth in its course. One of the remarkable
                            meteorolites mention in history fell 467 B.C. It was still extant in
                            Pliny's time, and he mentions that it was as large as a wagon. In
                            passing through our atmosphere, meteorolites undergo some change, as
                            they always take fire in the upper regions, and arrive at the ground
                            quite hot. There are two kinds, the metallic and stony aerolite.</p>
                        <p>W<hi rend="sc">E</hi> take it back in its totality. The death was not a
                            phenomenal one. The ærolite did not come hurtling from the infinite
                            depths of space. It did not tear a ragged opening through the roof of
                            Mr. <pb id="VAA3891-348" n="343"/> Grover's house, nor did it crash
                            through his breast and then pass through the bed, the floor, and so on
                            into the earth, five feet. Mr. Grover's daughter and her husband were
                            not away from home at the time of the accident, and they didn't fail to
                            discover his death until the next morning. He didn't die. He didn't get
                            hurt. He didn't even get frightened. He wasn't there; he isn't anywhere
                            now. Durn him. If Mr. Leonidas Grover ever should come into existence,
                            and get killed by an ærolite, he will have to get some one else to write
                            his obituary. It is a nice enough thing to moralize over, and it
                            furnishes great scope for the play of sentimental fancy, but we despise
                            the subject, and we have precious little faith in thunder stones,
                            anyhow. The audacious villain who invented the canard is an unmeasured
                            fraud and an infinite liar. Hell gapes for him. The devil beckons to him
                            with his hands, and horns and tail Eternal cremation, with a brimstone
                            accompaniment, is his doom.</p>

                        <head>A BLIND TRAMP.</head>
                        <p>He got on the train at the station just across the river from Little
                            Rock. He was shabbily dressed, apparently not more than twenty-five
                            years old, and totally blind. From the way he moved it was apparent that
                            his blindness was recent&#151;the recollection of previous sight
                            adding to the crushing weight of his misery. He was gaunt, ill-fed,
                            sick, <pb id="VAA3891-349" n="344"/> and the expression of his face was
                            hard, sullen, rebellious, defiant, just as if he were ready to curse God
                            and die. The conductor came in, and studiously ignored him in collecting
                            fares. (They have the "whitest" set of employes on the Iron Mountain
                            road to be found in the United States.) For hours the blind man sat in
                            his seat, without apparently moving a muscle or limb, brooding over the
                            hard fate which enables some to lap their souls in the elysium of
                            plenty, while it takes from another food, clothing, health, and what is
                            more precious than all, blessed vision, through which the thirsty soul
                            drinks in the beauty of nature. The train rolled, and rumbled, and
                            jolted; people came and went; children chattered and women laughed about
                            him; but through all, the blind man maintained his imperturbable
                            stolidity. It was not a pleasant face. Some of its lines were suggestive
                            of vice. But the mountain weight of irreparable misfortune overshadowed
                            everything else. I looked on the poor creature and pitied him. The
                            repulsive sight had for me a horrible fascination. I looked from the
                            window to shut out the sight, but was compelled to turn again and again,
                            to watch the stone-like figure with its set face never turning,
                            apparently oblivious to everything except its own ever-present misery.
                            Finally, I remembered something I should not have forgotten. I took a
                            buzzard from my pocket, walked over, and gently dropped it in the open
                            palm of a very dirty hand, which rested idly in his greasy lap. As the
                            coin touched him, he started as if he had been stung, <pb
                                id="VAA3891-350" n="345"/> but in the same moment, recognizing the
                            nature of the transaction, closed on the money with eager touch and
                            conveyed it with a tremulous motion to his vest pocket. There is a
                            contagion of good example as well as of vice, and in a moment others had
                            done likewise, until the dirty vest pocket bulged with its wealth.
                            Through all, the blind man made no vocal sign of gratitude, but two
                            tears gathered in his sightless eyes, and rolled down his swarthy,
                            smoke-dried cheeks. At Walnut Ridge a gentleman went out and bought him
                            a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, which he devoured ravenously, as if
                            food had been a stranger to him. We learned that he had been living with
                            a brother in Arkansas, who died, and he had started out to hunt another
                            brother who lived somewhere in Illinois.</p>

                        <p>He was taken completely by surprise. He didn't expect anything of the
                            kind. It was a gold-headed cane. He choked with emotion as he gazed upon
                            the "testimonial." As Secretary of the Senate he had done the least work
                            and drawn the most pay, but his subordinates were so impressed with the
                            grace, the ability, the <hi rend="i">suaviter in modo,</hi> with which
                            he drew his pay, that they couldn't help testifying their profound
                            appreciation of his good qualities. Some occult influence lurks within
                            the damp and musty walls of that old <pb id="VAA3891-351" n="346"/>
                            State House, and it always makes the employes affectionately generous
                            about the close of the session, and leaves the "recipient" tearful and
                            gushing. Session after session it is always the same. The secretary is
                            never moved in that way. He finds it more blessed to receive than to
                            give. His understrappers may be affable, and faithful, and genial, and
                            all that sort of thing, but it never occurs to him to give them a gold
                            watch each, or a cane, or a barrel of flour. Singular, isn't it? Wonder
                            why the old thing don't work that way once in a while, by way of a
                            change? There is some great principle in the regular recurrence of this
                            testimonial business at the close of each session, if we could only get
                            at it.</p>
                        <p>L<hi rend="sc">IFE</hi> at West Baden is not'a season of unalloyed
                            delights. It has its drawbacks, so to speak. The chickens are cooked in
                            the highest style of the art, and the glistening leaves of the maple
                            trees, freshly washed by the rain, relieve the tired eye with their
                            grateful green. Somehow I always fancied that the shade of the sugar
                            maple was cooler than that cast by any other tree. But the insect pests
                            are at times almost intolerable. There is the mosquito. He don't amount
                            to much. We know all his ways. He does not trouble at night, but when we
                            go into the leafy covert in pursuit of berries he gets in his work.
                            Going into the leafy covert, however, is indulged in but sparingly by
                            the veterans. As a general thing a fellow goes into the leafy covert <pb
                                id="VAA3891-352" n="347"/> the day after his arrival. Then he waits
                            for some other fellow to go. If you should ask me why this apparent want
                            of confidence in the leafy covert, I should answer, I should tell
                                you&#151;C<hi rend="sc">HIGGERS.</hi> You don't know what a
                            chigger is, O city-bred reader? God keep you in ignorance. The chigger
                            is an infinitesimal tick that bites and burrows in the flesh. It is
                            almost invisible to the naked eye, and yet when you are bitten the first
                            impression is that a hornet has crawled up the leg of your trowsers. One
                            sting satisfies the most malevolent hornet, and with the aid of ammonia
                            the pain is soon gone, and the swelling abates. With the chigger it is
                            different. When you go to bed at night every chigger that has effected a
                            lodgment opens up in a fresh series of bites, each one of them
                            equivalent to that of a large pismire, and there is no let up till you
                            kill the critter by scratching or greasing with lardr coal oil or some
                            other unguent. Then he festers in his burrow and is sloughed out. The
                            best way is to grease on suspicion every time you go into the woods. The
                            same powrer that made the chigger doubtless sat the elephant on his four
                            legs, and started him out in life with his baggage train in front, in
                            imitation of the tactics of that valiant Massachusetts warrior, Gen.
                            Nathaniel P. Banks, when he charged Dick Taylor's intrenchments at
                            Mansfield. On general principles, I'd rather be an elephant than a
                            chigger. There's more style about him. But if I had a spite against a
                            fellow-creature, and could overcome my natural kindness of heart long
                            enough to make it warm for him, I'd <pb id="VAA3891-353" n="348"/>
                            rather be a chigger. If Job had been well chiggered early in his
                            affliction, there would have been a different story to tell of that
                            bilious man of God. (Bilious comes from <hi rend="i">bile,</hi> O
                            captious critic, and I am sure Job was covered with <hi rend="i"
                                >biles,</hi> from head to foot.)</p>
                        <p>But the Black Gnat is the triumph of nature when it comes to pests. I
                            have such a respect for this little scoundrel's power of annoyance that
                            I spell him with a capital G. He is small&#151;a mere filmy dot,
                            floating in the air like a speck of dust, and only distinguishable from
                            the inanimate motes by his zigzag motion in flying. But he bites with a
                            terrible bite. It hurts worse than that of a gallinipper, and raises a
                            round red spot, visible for days after. The black gnat pursues you

                            sharp, stinging pain of his bite. Turning your hand, under-side up, you
                            see a small black speck, and if he has been sufficiently absorbed in his
                            breakfast to forget his usual caution, you smash him with a blow heavy
                            enough to kill a rabbit. Indeed, you regret that he is not as big as a
                            bumble bee, so that you could have that much more revenge.</p>
                        <p>Y<hi rend="sc">OUNG</hi> men don't take kindly to babies as a general
                            thing. A man must be forty at least to appreciate them. It is natural
                            that a fellow who is nearing the other end should begin to take an
                            interest in those who are just starting. Consequently <pb
                                id="VAA3891-354" n="349"/> quently we find that the young buck, who
                            is all cuff, collar, hair and necktie, views with horror the red,
                            squirming, colicky thing which is to become a man or a woman, as the
                            case may be, if its luck carries it through the "second summer," and the
                            gauntlet of mumps, measles, scarlatina, and other infantile ailments. To
                            his barbaric ear there is no music in the squawk of a Tupperian "well
                            spring of pleasure," and it is only after baby begins to "take notice"
                            that he can tolerate it. The subject is, however, worthy of study in all
                            its stages of development, from its first wondering stare at
                            surroundings, all the way up through the era of tumbling off the back
                            porch, to boyhood, marbles and rubber slings. The baby is always
                            perverse, always trying to swallow its fist, always reaching for things,
                            and generally moist. They always look like somebody. Getting baby to
                            sleep is the principal occupation of the female members of the
                            household, and fighting sleep soon comes to be the life-work of the
                            baby. So many subterfuges and confidence games are resorted to that he
                            finally comes to regard sleep as a' "game" that is being played on him,
                            and on the principle that it is generally safe to decline doing what
                            your opponent wants you to do, he resolutely cultivates wakefulness, and
                            resents all the inventions of the enemy, from the soothing lullaby to
                            the vibratory motion of the cradle. Nobody knows whether a baby would
                            ever voluntarily go to sleep or not. The experiment has never been
                            tried. Probably he regards sleep as so much time lost, during <pb

                            resents the various artifices by which he is swindled out of his

                        <p>W<hi rend="sc">ILLIAM</hi> J. M<hi rend="sc">URTAGH,</hi> proprietor of
                            the <hi rend="i">National Republican,</hi> of Washington, D. C., has
                            been held "pussonally responsible" by a "puffeck gentleman" of one of
                            the "fust families of Kentucky, sah," for a paragraph which reflected on
                            the "puffeck gentleman's" private character. The instrument which
                            administered justice in this instance was the cowhide, a new departure
                            for Kentucky outraged honor, which generally avails itself of the pistol
                            and the bowie-knife. The account was settled immediately in front of
                            brother Murtagh's office, a most conspicuous place. There were the usual
                            and more than the usual number of innocent spectators to see it through,
                            and the fur flew in most extraordinary style. Mr. Murtagh is not the
                            chap to take any extra steps, but on this occasion he performed a
                            regular castanet dance, never missing a step, and keeping time to the
                            music of the cowhide in the most practiced manner. Mr. James Wheatley,
                            the outraged scion of Kentucky, handled the ready cowhide in the most
                            skillful style, and was cheered on in the glorious work of vindicating
                            his moral character by a hundred sympathetic voices. A Kentucky
                            gentleman abhors any vulgar or unseemly haste. Mr. Wheatley took his
                            time, and kept the entertainment up thirty-three minutes and four
                            seconds exactly, or <pb id="VAA3891-356" n="351"/> until the editorial
                            legs refused to execute the will of Wheatley. Every spectator declared
                            he never saw such beautiful dancing since the days of the agile Elssler.
                            Mr. Wheatley's wounded " 'onah, sah," was completely healed when he
                            released the non-resistant Murtagh, who will hereafter make diligent
                            inquiry into the pedigree of anyone whose biography he expects to
                            publish in the <hi rend="i">Republican.</hi> He will take a cowhiding

                                rend="i">Journal</hi> has been unusually brilliant this week. On
                            Wednesday he announced that "the white moonlight was very bright last
                            night." In the same paper he said a genteel and quite eyewatering thing
                            about the dying month. It was this:</p>
                        <p>"The month of April will close her account with nature to-day, and turn
                            her toes up to the roots of the daisies. She has made a good record, and
                            leaves the earth better and more beautiful for having lived."</p>
                        <p>Now that is what we call the neat and gallant thing to say about a month
                            that has wept, and frowned, and raged, and thundered, and whooped
                            around, as April has done. There is no vulgar slang in that touching
                            obituary. The flowers of rhetoric fairly smother it. A reporter who was
                                <pb id="VAA3891-357" n="352"/> not in love with nature, and had not
                            a kind word for every month in the year, would have coarsely said "April
                            peters out to-day," or "The old gal, April, passes in her checks
                            to-night, drat her." There would have been no tender reference to the
                            defunct lady's toes and the roots of the poetic daisies; no generous
                            mention of her "good record," which is not strictly truthful, but was
                            very sweet in the meteorological editor, all the same. No, there would
                            have been nothing said of April that would bring tears to human eyes, as
                            the weather editor's paragraph does. When the young man wants a
                            situation&#151;well, we would scorn to hold out any inducements that
                            would take a star from the galaxy of a cotemporary, but we should like
                            to have something touching and tender like that said in T<hi rend="sc"
                                >HE</hi> H<hi rend="sc">ERALD</hi> about every day in the year, with
                            an occasional pretty speech about the moon thrown in.</p>
                        <p>S<hi rend="sc">OMETHING</hi> ought to be done with the interrogation
                            point. It has become, if possible, more of a vagabond than the comma,
                            and more of a nuisance than the apostrophe. As a medium for the
                            expression of sarcasm the interrogation point has lost its force. Used
                            for that purpose, in parenthesis, it expresses but one thing, and that
                            is the ignorance of the writer. A man of little learning and much spleen
                            makes use of the degraded point in this style on all occasions. He says,
                            "the gentlemanly (?) editor of the War Whoop," or "the honorable <pb
                                id="VAA3891-358" n="353"/> (?) M. C.," and he fancies he has broken
                            down his enemy with the most withering sarcasm. He can't manipulate
                            words to help him out, but he can depend on the interrogation point.
                            Inside the parentheses it always looks fresh and original to him. He
                            knows he didn't invent it, but he thinks the public will believe he did.
                            It is regarded as a perfect battering ram by unsophisticated writers.
                            Hurled at an enemy, he is sure to tremble under the pressure, they
                            imagine. It is the plummet that marks a writer's ability and indexes his
                            temper. It proves the one shallow and the other bad. Come to think of
                            it, the interrogation point is always used <hi rend="i">en
                                parenthesis,</hi> when there is bad blood between the combatants. It
                            is never found in a tolerant, reasonable, sensible, printed controversy,
                            in its sarcastic capacity. If it would only confine itself to its
                            legitimate office, and keep out of such questionable company as the
                            parenthesis family, it would hold a position as one of the best points
                            in our language. It should eschew the sarcastic. It is a role it does
                            not succeed in, and it should abandon it. Any writer who can not express
                            sarcasm without the interrogation point had better die with all his
                            sarcasm in him.</p>

                            usual jerky rhetoric, that the people are in revolt&#151;that
                            somebody has opened the "caverns of want," and unchained "the wild
                            beasts of desolation," thus giving the ghosts of the dead an opportunity
                            to "stalk" at midnight, and point with "fleshless fingers" at the
                            towering elevators and glutted markets, while they fondle the brindle
                            wolf which sits and howls at the grave's mouth. "The
                            people"&#151;that is such of the people as are not in
                            revolt&#151;would like to know why the rest of "the people" are in
                            revolt, but Nauvoo declines to tell them. He asks them if they would
                            slake their raging curiosity, to go out on the streets and interrogate
                            the flinty stones, which, hard-hearted as they are admitted to be, "have
                            more feeling than Sherman or Morton." If the stones fail to respond,
                            then the inquisitive reader is invited to "enter the damp and dismal
                            shaft of the mine, where the deadly gases generate, and pursue his
                            investigations. If the deadly gases don't respond, the next alternative
                            is to "Go to old ocean's depths; enter her dark and slimy caverns, above
                            whom the white-capped waves sing requiems of wrecks, and horrid,
                            strangling deaths; ask the sparkling diamonds clinging to the rocks
                            o'erhead, or the grinning skulls beneath your feet." Much as we would
                            like to know why "the people" are in revolt, the slimy caverns, "above
                                <hi rend="i">whom,</hi>" etc., are too forbidding. It would be easy
                            enough to interrogate the diamonds and the grinning skulls <pb

                            young ocean&#151;repel. We will have to wait. Perhaps the people
                            themselves will tell us why they are in revolt, without waiting for the

                            health, with unimpaired capacity for the assimilation of his matutinal
                            cocktail. Byerly was his name, and Governor Warmoth was his bane. A card

                            than ordinary vigor; carried a slender rattan cane, terminating in a
                            human leg in ivory, and was considered a good fellow, though not at all
                            "stalwart." If he had improved his opportunities as well as Warmouth
                            did, he could afford to be "bounced," and then quit the game ahead.</p>
                        <p>P<hi rend="sc">UTTY</hi> is the best material out of which to make a
                            governor. It is soft, pliable, oily. A putty man will do nothing to
                            conflict with the ger-reat and gel-lorious per-rinciples of the
                            Democratic party, said principles being that the people must rule. If it
                                <pb id="VAA3891-362" n="357"/> happens that the people disagree, and
                            one portion takes possession of property belonging to the others, then
                            the noble man of putty stands back, and disinterestedly watches the
                            fight. His soul shrinks from the thought of bloodshed. Besides, it might
                            lose him a few votes, when he comes to run for the presidency, if he
                            were to take sides with "capital" against "labor."</p>
                        <p>C<hi rend="sc">OMING</hi> down Mississippi street the other morning, we
                            overtook a little bantam rooster, two sizes larger than a mocking-bird,
                            which had picked up two great Bramah hens, but little smaller than
                            ostriches, and was doing the genteel thing by them. The little cock is
                            the children's pet in a neighboring family, but the hens were evidently
                            strangers, refugees, perhaps, from some grocer's coop. There was
                            something very human in the little bantam's strut, and the fussy airs of
                            protectorship that he assumed; but the subservience of the great
                            lubberly hens to the feathered midget was absolutely absurd.</p>

                            cutting up in Canada. Unless he operates with great caution he will
                            learn the difference between the British lion and the national fowl of
                            this country, which is rapidly being hybridized into "an ineffable
                            buzzard."</p>

                        <p>M<hi rend="sc">ISS</hi> V<hi rend="sc">ICKSEN</hi> is one of those
                            curiously-constistituted females who "can't <hi rend="i">bear</hi>
                            children," and who are always informing people of the fact. She imparted
                            this valuable information to a mixed company, of whom Bluejazy, the
                            brute, happened to be one, the other evening. "How do you know you
                            can't?" said Blue. In about two minutes, from the snapping of Miss
                            Vicksen's black eyes, it became apparent that she had seen the point,
                            and Bluejazy remembered an engagement down town.</p>
                        <p>E<hi rend="sc">DITORS</hi> are entirely too free with the brand. They
                            "brand" each other as liars on the slightest provocation. It is bad
                            enough to "denounce" a fellow. Branding is too cruel. There is the
                            double-turreted old termagant of the <hi rend="i">Sentinel,</hi> who has
                            branded the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> half a dozen times within the past
                            fortnight. He seems to like to affix the brand. He feels a little brandy
                            every day.</p>

                            paper that amounts to anything can afford to be without a "course." But
                            when a paper is always talking about its "course" there are grounds for
                            suspicion that it don't amount to much. The condor, as it flies, has no
                            need to call attention to its "course." The peewee has.</p>
