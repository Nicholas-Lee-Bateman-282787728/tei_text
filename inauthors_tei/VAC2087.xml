            <head rend="center">THE DAYS THAT USED TO BE</head>
            <lg>
              <l>Sometimes I get to thinking of the days that used to be,</l>
              <l>And I wonder which ones were the best and happiest to me;</l>
              <l>Then as my thoughts go flitting back across the lapse of years,</l>
              <l>A sort of mist comes to my eyes that is mighty close to tears;</l>
              <l>For I think of all the happy times I had in childhood's hours,</l>
              <l>When I wandered, free and careless, like a bee among the flowers;</l>
              <l>With no thought of the future, I would run and shout with glee;</l>
              <l>For all the world was bright and fair, in the days that used to be.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Oh, the days that used to be, when I first attended school,</l>
              <l>To get a little learning, by a certain rote and rule;</l>
              <l>We had reading and geography, and then arithmetic,</l>
              <l>Before the time for recess came, when we run out so quick</l>
              <pb id="VAC2087-008" n="6"/>
              <l>To get to playing blackman and many other games;</l>
              <l>But it's been so long ago now, that I've forgot their names.</l>
              <l>I thought that I was happy then, and I think that you'll agree</l>
              <l>That the sun was always shining bright, in the days that used to be.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Oh, the days that used to be, when in young manhood's prime,</l>
              <l>I went courting some fair maiden I regarded as sublime;</l>
              <l>She had a winning winsome smile, and she was wondrous fair;</l>
              <l>She was indeed a fairy queen, in my castles in the air.</l>
              <l>Her form was near perfection, and starry were her eyes,</l>
              <l>I thought if I could win her I would surely get a prize;</l>
              <l>But now as I look backward, it's very plain to me,</l>
              <l>That the moonlight made me foolish in the days that used to be.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Oh, the days that used to be, when wife and I first wed;</l>
              <l>Though since that happy time many, many years have fled;</l>
              <l>We've trudged along life's rugged road, hand in hand together;</l>

              <l>And it hasn't been all sunshine, for we've had some stormy weather;</l>
              <l>But the man who isn't wedded, little knows the thrills he misses,</l>
              <l>By not living in a cottage on bread and cheese and kisses;</l>
              <l>For when the babe was old enough to dandle on my knee,</l>
              <l>My cup of happiness was filled in the days that used to be.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Oh, the days that used to be, the days that used to be,</l>
              <l>Bring many recollections that are very dear to me;</l>
              <l>And I never can forget them, and I couldn't if I'd try;</l>
              <l>Though it may be that I sometimes their glamour glorify;</l>
              <l>For when I'm sitting all alone a voice will say to me,</l>
              <l>"You thought that you were happy in the days that used to be,</l>
              <l>But if you'll quit your dreaming, I think you'll find somehow,</l>
              <l>That the happiest moments of your life are in the joyous now."</l>

              <l rend="ti-1">When you and I were boys?</l>
              <l>We thought we had some troubles then,</l>

              <l>And gazing through the branches high,</l>
              <l>We watched the clouds go floating by,</l>

              <l>With its everlastin' tickin'</l>

              <l rend="ti-1">And friends almost forgot.</l>
              <l>Then you'll wander through the woodlands</l>

              <l>But as it is, by God decreed,</l>

              <l>Till I came to a stream where I went in a swimming,</l>

              <l>As she let me up, in a voice that was tearful,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">I promised never to go there any more.</l>
              <l>And from that day to this I have always been fearful,</l>

            <lg>
              <l>In my home are many treasures, some of them are old and rare;</l>
              <l>There are pictures of departed friends, and a curl of golden hair;</l>
              <l>There's the ring my mother gave me many, many years agone,</l>
              <l>That I'll keep till I shall meet her, when a brighter day shall dawn;</l>
              <l>There's an heirloom brought by father, from a land far o'er the sea,</l>
              <l>And I've promised that I'll keep it, that it ne'er shall part from me.</l>
              <l>All of these I fondly cherish and 'twould pain me much to lose;</l>
              <l>But I've something far more precious, 'tis a pair of baby shoes.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Just a pair of baby shoes with battered toes and run down heel;</l>
              <l>And when I gaze upon them, tears into my eyes will steal.</l>
              <l>For they bring a recollection, time itself cannot destroy,</l>
              <l>And in fancy I can see again, a little blue eyed boy,</l>
              <l>Running down the street to meet me, as I homeward make my way,</l>
              <pb id="VAC2087-022" n="20"/>
              <l>Tired of life and all its worries, at the closing of the day;</l>
              <l>Could I feel again the kisses that his baby lips have given,</l>
              <l>It would be the same as tasting of the higher joys of Heaven.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>There's a rose a sweetheart gave me, that dear girl I see her yet;</l>
              <l>She believed that I was faithless, which caused tears of vain regret.</l>
              <l>Though the hand of fate was 'gainst us, and we both tried to forget,</l>
              <l>I believe 'twould been far better, if we two had never met.</l>
              <l>There's a book mark that my sister gave to me at Christmas tide;</l>
              <l>And the sled that brother made me, upon which we used to slide.</l>
              <l>So among so many treasures it seems very hard to choose.</l>
              <l>But there's something pulls my heartstrings when I see those little shoes.</l>

              <l>Now while their the'ry may be true,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">I have my doubts of this</l>
              <l>When they tell me that there's microbes</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">In a good, old-fashioned kiss.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

              <l rend="ti-1">With the sweetest girl you know</l>
              <l>While sitting in the parlor with</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">The light turned way down low?</l>
              <l>If you didn't I can tell you</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">You have missed a lot of fun,</l>
              <l>So if you'll listen to me</l>

            <lg>
              <l>First you sit down on the sofa</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And you squeeze her little hand,</l>
              <l>Then you put your arm around her</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Firm as any iron band;</l>
              <l>Then you draw her up close to you,</l>

              <l>Place her head upon your shoulder</l>

            <lg>
              <l>Then with anticipation</l>

              <l>Way down in their depths you'll see</l>

              <l rend="ti-1">For haste may spoil the game,</l>
              <l>But when she looks up at you</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And her cheeks are all aflame;</l>
              <l>Then with a gentle movement</l>

              <l rend="ti-1">As a bee upon a bud,</l>
              <l>And when you've drawn the microbes</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">From within their fairy den,</l>
              <l>Just take the time to draw your breath</l>

              <l rend="ti-1">I don't feel scared,&mdash;do you?</l>
              <l>Why if ten thousand microbes</l>

              <l>As along the trail of life I've wandered,</l>
              <l>I've seen a sign over which I've pondered.</l>
              <l>It stands by the side of the railroad track;</l>
              <l>It's written in letters of deepest black.</l>

              <l>For when you're tempted to go astray,</l>

              <l>Never repeat the tale you have heard;</l>
              <l>Had that sign been heeded 'twould have never occurred.</l>

            <lg>
              <l>A gay and handsome drummer,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Who from home was far away;</l>
              <l>Slowly to his hotel wandered,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">At the close of one hard day.</l>
              <l>After checking up his business,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">He goes to his lonely bed,</l>
              <l>And a thousand fitful fancies</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Flit within his troubled head.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>He dreamed that he lay dying,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Upon a bed of pain;</l>
              <l>He felt as if his time had come,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">That he ne'er would rise again;</l>
              <l>And his mind in retrospection,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">O'er his route goes tripping back,</l>
              <l>And he thinks of many maidens,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Whom he'd met along life's track.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Then the landlord stands beside him,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Lays his hand upon his brow,</l>
              <l>And he bends and whispers to him;</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">"Are you feeling better now?</l>
              <l>Do you want to send a message,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">To your sweetheart kind and true?</l>
              <l>Just speak her name, and I will bring</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>A smile of childlike innocence,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Overspread the drummer's face;</l>
              <pb id="VAC2087-043" n="41"/>
              <l>He upward then extends his arms,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">As if some one to embrace.</l>
              <l>Then a change comes to his features,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And the childlike smile has fled.</l>
              <l>The landlord asks again her name,</l>

              <l>"I swore that I would wed them all,"</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">In faint accents he said.</l>
              <l>He here woke up and looked about,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And said in some dismay;</l>

              <l>In the silence of last midnight,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">As I sought in vain for sleep,</l>
              <l>I felt a curious feeling</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Over all my system creep;</l>
              <l>There I lay, as in a stupor,</l>

              <l>And with prophetic vision</l>

              <l>I looked around expecting</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">To see at least one frown,</l>

              <l>The editors all wore silk tiles,</l>

              <l>They had gained of fame and riches,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">All that any heart desired.</l>
              <l>And they flew about in aeroplanes,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Dressed out in silken gown.</l>
              <l>Why the mailman even had a snap,</l>

              <l>And I felt somewhat bewildered,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">As I wandered up and down,</l>

              <l rend="ti-1">I was weary with the quest;</l>
              <l>So sought a seat in the city park,</l>

              <l rend="ti-1">We banished every "dub."</l>
              <l>We laid aside dissension,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">On jealousy we'd frown,</l>
              <l>And we all pulled together,</l>

              <l>It would be a grand achievement,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Could we make it one half true.</l>
              <l>Then when our toil is ended,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">When our burdens are laid down,</l>
              <l>We'll each one have a monument,</l>

              <l>Well, yes, I've joined some lodges,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And I've taken a few degrees;</l>
              <l>I've joined the Elks and Eagles,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Redmen and the K. of P's;</l>
              <l>I've also ridden the Oddfellows goat,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And that of the M. W. A.,</l>
              <l>But the darndest time that ever I had</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Was the night I took the Hay.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>They brought me in the lodge room,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And they made a lot of noise,</l>
              <l>But I thought to myself, "It's easy,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">I'll soon be one of the boys."</l>
              <l>Then they sang a song of Mary,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Who once owned a little lamb;</l>
              <l>But I think from the way it treated me,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Then they put me on a whirly-magig,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">I was in a terrible pickle,</l>
              <l>For they poked me in the ribs and said,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">"Keep your feet up out of the sickle."</l>
              <l>Then they whirled me round and round again,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">For an hour and a half I think.</l>
              <l>Then they let me down and someone yelled,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">"Quick, give him a drink, a drink."</l>

              <l>No doubt they are delicious,</l>

            <lg>
              <l>I've traveled through this vale of tears,</l>
              <l>For well nigh onto fifty years,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And yet can't understand,</l>
              <l>Why man should pass me day by day,</l>
              <l>And never deign to look my way,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Nor even wave his hand;</l>
              <l>Until it comes the time to vote,</l>
              <l>And then I make a mental note,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">That I can't walk a mile,</l>
              <l>But what some politician suave,</l>
              <l>Will give his hand an upward wave,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And greet me with a smile.</l>
              <l>He thinks that he is pretty slick,</l>
              <l>In pulling off this hoary trick,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">But he has another think;</l>
              <l>For when I come to cast my vote,</l>
              <l>I then recall my mental note,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And surely soak that gink.</l>
              <l>For I'm an independent cuss,</l>
              <l>Of brains I have no over-plus,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">But heed my little rhyme,</l>
              <l>If you want to make a hit with me,</l>
              <l>Just wave your hand so I can see,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And keep smiling all the time.</l>

            <lg>
              <l>I don't believe, in the days of old,</l>
              <l>When men were dressed in lace and gold,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And knighthood was in flower;</l>
              <l>That times were any better then,</l>
              <l>For the ordinary denizen,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Than at the present hour.</l>
              <l>And so I think it just a bluff,</l>
              <l>That men were made of better stuff,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">In those brave days of old;</l>
              <l>Therefore I'll bet a picayune,</l>
              <l>That when the time was opportune,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">They'd filch their neighbor's gold.</l>
              <l>Of course, they made a fine parade,</l>
              <l>When dressed out in their tinselled braid,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">But it was just veneer,</l>
              <l>And covered up as common clay,</l>
              <l>As the would be blue-bloods of to-day,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And I expect as queer.</l>
              <l>So when I read of olden times,</l>
              <l>And what men did in foreign climes,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">I'll have to say, nay, nay,</l>
              <l>And offer up a loud amen,</l>
              <l>That I'm a common citizen,</l>

              <l>It is one that is told, either soon or late,</l>

              <l>Though I know it is true what someone has said,</l>

              <l>With affairs of this life I have been so engrossed,</l>

              <l>For I know I must reap just like I have sown,</l>
              <l>And whatever for me the Lord has in store</l>
              <l>I'll find when I reach that golden shore.</l>
              <l>When the thread of my life shall snap in time's loom,</l>

              <l>And while your loss, brother, we deeply deplore,</l>
              <l>And the haunts which once knew you will know you no more.</l>
              <l>So long as we stay on this earthly scene</l>
              <l>We'll cherish your mem'ry and keep your grave green."</l>
              <l>So I'm only waiting for the boatman pale</l>
              <l>(For I know I'm nearing the end of the trail)</l>
              <l>To carry me over the dark river Styx</l>
              <l>And then I'll be in a de'il of a fix,</l>
              <l>For I'll find that an angel of God on high</l>
              <l>Had kept me ever under his watchful eye,</l>
              <l>And had written down in that book of gold</l>
              <l>All sins I'd committed, all fibs I had told.</l>
              <l>When I ask to see the credit side of the book,</l>
              <l>He'll say nothing there, no use to look;</l>
              <l>You will have to go to the region below</l>
              <l>To the place where they never have any snow.</l>

            <head rend="center">THAT FAR OFF LAND OF FRANCE</head>
            <lg>
              <l>We had read about the trouble,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">They were having over there;</l>
              <l>But it seemed so far away from us</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">We really didn't care,</l>
              <l>If the Allies, or the Germans,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Would gain in their advance,</l>
              <l>As they fought against each other,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">In that far off land of France.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Thus we read the same old story,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Until one April day;</l>
              <l>We found that us Americans</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Were mixed up in the fray.</l>
              <l>Some thought 'twas simply awful,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">(You could see it in their glance)</l>
              <l>To have our boys a fightin',</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">In that far off land of France.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Then this German propaganda</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Was regarded as a jest.</l>
              <l>But I think now it's time for us,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">To do our very best;</l>
              <l>For we cannot win, by mopin' round,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Like we were in a trance,</l>
              <l>And have our boys a fightin',</l>

            <lg>
              <l>We must lay aside our politics,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">No matter how we vote,</l>
              <l>And all pull together;</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Then, we'll get the Kaiser's goat.</l>
              <l>And the only way to do it,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Is to go down in your pants,</l>
              <l>And back the boys that's fightin',</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">In that far off land of France.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Now I haven't got much money;</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">But I'm goin' to give my bit.</l>
              <l>And I'm goin' to keep on givin',</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Till we make those devils quit.</l>
              <l>And the kid&mdash;he's joined the army,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And he's goin' to take a chance,</l>
              <l>With the other boys that's fightin',</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">In that far off land of France.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Then a sort of funny feelin'</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Come a creepin' round my heart;</l>
              <l>And it wouldn't take so very much</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">To make the teardrops start.</l>
              <l>When I see the kid a sailin'</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Cross the ocean's broad expanse,</l>
              <l>To where our boys are fightin',</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">In that far off land of France.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>But I get a lot of comfort,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">When the fact's brought home to me,</l>
              <l>That the reason they are fightin',</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Is for human liberty.</l>
              <pb id="VAC2087-088" n="86"/>
              <l>So I'll not get pessimistic,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Under any circumstance,</l>
              <l>But I'll cheer the boys that's fightin',</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">In that far off land of France.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Then when the boys come marchin' home,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">With glad and gallant tread,</l>
              <l>(Though many may be left behind</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">A white cross at their head),</l>
              <l>I can look them in the eye and say,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">I never missed a chance,</l>
              <l>To back you boys, while fightin',</l>

              <l>It now has been almost two years,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Since we first went to war;</l>
              <l>And still some folks are asking</l>

              <l>That question now don't interest me,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">I realize we're in it;</l>
              <l>And the only question I ask is</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">What can we do to win it.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>And so the call has come again,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">For another Liberty Loan;</l>
              <l>We are going to make it a winner,</l>

              <l>And we can do that easily,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>It will take a lot of money,</l>

              <l>To send those Germans to the place</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Where no angels ever dwell.</l>
              <l>So when the call comes to you,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">You should at once respond,</l>
              <l>For you can't be patriotic</l>

              <l>For when the boys come back again,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">From across the big salt pond,</l>
              <l>They'll know you're a dirty slacker,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Remember that you'll have to live,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Through all the coming years,</l>
              <l>In a country that was saved for you</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">By a soldier's blood and tears.</l>
              <l>And when your life is ended,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">When you reach the Great Beyond,</l>
              <l>St. Peter will say, "You shall not pass</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">You failed to buy a bond."</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>So in this fight for freedom,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Our aims we must defend;</l>
              <l>Do everything within our power,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">To reach a successful end.</l>
              <l>Then if you've done your duty,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">When your heavenly robes are donned,</l>
              <l>St. Peter will bid you welcome,</l>

            <head rend="center">THE LIMITED SERVICE MAN</head>
            <lg>
              <l>When Uncle Sam got in the war,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">In nineteen seventeen;</l>
              <l>I knew I ought to help him out,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">My duty was clearly seen.</l>
              <l>But when I tried to volunteer,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">They said I was too light;</l>
              <l>They said they only wanted men&mdash;</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Men who could work and fight.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>So they turned me down in the infantry,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And in the artillery, too;</l>
              <l>So I went before the conscription board,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">To see what they would do.</l>
              <l>They put me in the limited class,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">I think 'twas a dirty trick;</l>
              <l>Then sent me out to the Far Northwest,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">To use a shovel and pick.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>They sent me out to the spruce woods front,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Where they learned me how to drill;</l>
              <l>By hiking me up the mountain side,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Till I certainly had my fill.</l>
              <l>We had squads right, we had squads left,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Sometimes on the double quick;</l>
              <l>And then we had, right shoulder arms,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">With my shovel or my pick.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>And thus the days went slowly by,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Till I was good and tired;</l>
              <l>But the thought that I was doing my bit,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Kept my spirits still inspired.</l>
              <pb id="VAC2087-108" n="106"/>
              <l>At night I'd dream of the battle front,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Where the shot and shell were thick,</l>
              <l>And in my dreams, I'd go over the top,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">With my shovel or my pick.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>And in those terrible battle dreams,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">I'd always come out best.</l>
              <l>Though the other lads sometimes complained,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">That I disturbed their rest.</l>
              <l>But when we heard the reveille,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">At fifteen minutes of six;</l>
              <l>We'd all roll out and rub our eyes,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And look for our shovels and picks.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>But now the armistice is signed,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">I'll soon be coming home;</l>
              <l>And I will be about as glad,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">As the lads who crossed the foam.</l>
              <l>But if I had gone across the sea,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">I'd have made those Germans sick,</l>
              <l>For I've certainly worked my muscles up,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">By using my shovel and pick.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Now, I suppose, when I get home,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Some guy will start to kid,</l>
              <l>And laugh about the spruce woods gang,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And the service that they did.</l>
              <l>But if he does, as sure as fate,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">I'll smash him with a brick;</l>
              <l>Then volunteer to dig his grave,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And furnish the shovel and pick.</l>

            <lg>
              <l>The kid who was called to the colors,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Is home from the service now;</l>
              <l>He's laid aside his army togs,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And is eating regular chow.</l>
              <l>He says the army rations,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Have destroyed his appetite;</l>
              <l>But he thinks that good home cooking,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Will bring it back all right.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>No more he gives attention,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">To the sound of fife and drum;</l>
              <l>Though their music once enthralled him,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">He now is both deaf and dumb;</l>
              <l>For him the call of the bugle,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Is naught but an empty sound,</l>
              <l>And the only music that interests him,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Is the bay of the hunting hound.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>No more he does guard duty,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">On storm-swept hill or plain;</l>
              <l>No more he hikes, with pack on his back,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Through the mud, the slush, and the rain;</l>
              <l>And he wouldn't salute a second Lieut.,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">To gain a D. S. C.,</l>
              <l>He says it's a case of S. O. L.</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">If he ever must do K. P.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>He's tired of din of battle,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Of war's pomp and display;</l>
              <l>He says disputed questions,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Should be settled some other way.</l>
              <l>He hasn't developed a yellow streak,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Nor he's not too proud to fight;</l>
              <l>But he thinks a little good horse sense,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Would settle all questions right.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Just a kid, when called to the colors,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">He now is a man, full grown;</l>
              <l>He's seen the ways of this old world,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Has opinions now of his own;</l>
              <l>He has no use for the jingo,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Nor the man that's inclined to brag;</l>
              <l>But he's just as patriotic now,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">As when he followed the flag.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>So he's joined the American Legion,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">A band that is tried and true;</l>
              <l>They're all one hundred percenters,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">And the rest of us should be, too.</l>
              <l>He says we must remember,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Not to let our vigilance lag,</l>
              <l>For there's only room, in U. S. A.</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">For one tongue, and one flag.</l>
