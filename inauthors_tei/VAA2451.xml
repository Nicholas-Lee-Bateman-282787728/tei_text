                        Th' ole longhand letters o' th' past, whether passin' between friends or
                        lovers, scented or unscented, reflected th' real inside works o' th' author

                        regarded as a matter of course, but looked upon as a grave error not t' be
                        passed o'er lightly. Th' laws o' punctuation, too, wuz lived up t' an'

                        t' admire; how a widower should profess his attachment fer a widow; how t'

                        letter accompanyin' a contribution t' a clergyman; how t' accept th' gift o'
                        a comb an' brush by mail; how t' write a letter accompanyin' th' gift o' a

                    <p>As th' month o' June draws nigh th' prospective bride should take a few
                        moments each day from her talcum powder an' devote 'em t' sober reflection.
                        Th' step she is plannin' t' take is th' real big headliner act of her life.
                        Let her consider it well. Let her study th' teachin's o' th' world's
                        greatest physiognomists, whose theories are interwoven with th' findin's o'
                        ever' known science, before she leaves th' ole home, or resigns her downtown
                        job. Let her take up nose readin' durin' th' few golden weeks that
                        remain.</p>
                    <p>I wonder how many girls o' t'day who are filled with rose-tinted visions o' a
                        happy married life know that th' septum o' th' nose is th' partition between
                        th' nostrils? I wonder how many girls o' t'day who are countin' th' minutes
                        till th' month o' roses know that ther whole future happiness depends on th'
                        thickness o' her fiance's septum an' its inclination t' droop or not droop?
                        If his septum is thin an' <pb id="VAA2451-016" n="[]"/> not disposed t'
                        droop let her take warnin' ere it is too late, fer it is a never failin'
                        sign of a retired liver. Tho' th' breakin' o' her engagement <figure

                        will be better fer both, as her alliance with an inactive liver <pb
                            id="VAA2451-017" n="[]"/> would mean nothin' better than a life filled
                        with misery an' regret.</p>
                    <p>Th' nose is nature's most humble organ next t' th' big toe. Th' whole human
                        character is boldly written thereon so that even she who runs may read.
                        Ther's no reason fer any-buddy but a blind girl gittin' stung. Whether th'
                        nose is pale, red or veined, it is now regarded as th' only reliable index
                        to character.</p>
                    <p>Ideality, veneration, constructiveness, cautiousness, mental imitation,
                        sublimity an' especially acquisitiveness (a disposition t' acquire property,
                        money, etc.,) are all factors in th' success o' life which may be easily
                        read in th' nose, an' which should be carefully considered by ever' girl
                        before she signs away her happiness.</p>
                    <p>Th' upper lip may be a perfect cupid's bow an' full o' amativeness, or th'
                        lower lip may be thick with a desire t' promote happiness, but neither
                        indicate anything in th' way o' makin' a livin'.</p>
                    <p>Th' eyes, long regarded as th' windows o' th' soul an' th' true index o'
                        character, are <pb id="VAA2451-018" n="[]"/> worthless without a gilt edged
                        nose. A fullness o' th' upper an' soft part o' th' cheek o'er th' malar bone
                        is another overworked sign that counts fer nothin' when appearin' in
                        conjunction with a thin septum. A square nose indicates a well developed
                        conscience, which is all well an' good if th' accompanyin' septum is of
                        standard gauge. Th' septum is th' thing whether th' nose is concave or
                        convex.</p>
                    <p>Fullness an' breadth o' th' nose above th' nostrils indicate a capacity fer
                        gittin' th' goodsï¿½a quality too rarely considered before wedlock, but
                        later regarded as bein' of inestimable value in th' pursuit o' happiness.
                        Such a quality, too, avails but little, however, if th' septum is thin.</p>
                    <p>O' course, its purty hard t' associate any sentiment with th' nose no matter
                        how close we occasionally git t' it, but jest th' same if th' prospective
                        bride while holdin' hands, 'll jest make a careful analysis o' her finance's

                    <p>It haint been so many years ago since you could stand on th' corner an' come
                        purty close t' guessin' ever' feller's age who passed along by th' cut o'
                        his jib. O' course our estimates were based largely on th' length an' style
                        o' whiskers. T'day whiskers are th' exception an' th' feller who throws
                        himself on th' tender mercies of a capable barber kin easily pass fer
                        thirty-two till he's seventy-nine.</p>
                    <p>In th' ole days when whiskers wuz th' hight o' ever' feller's ambition
                        nobuddy wuz ever taken seriously until they showed unmistakable evidence o'
                        ther ability t' grow a beard. After a feller raised a full set o' crisp
                        glossy whiskers, either red or black, he at once became eligible t' discuss
                        th' most momentous questions, either national or international Whiskers
                        denoted a mature mind. Professional men cultivated them in large bunches.
                        Sideburns wuz in high favor. Sometimes they were under control an' sometimes
                        they were <pb id="VAA2451-023" n="[]"/> allowed t' foller ther own
                        inclinations. Full sets were all th' rage with medical men, an' no family
                        doctor could expect t' enjoy th' full <figure entity="VAA2451-4">

                        ready t' pull.</p>
                    <p>Once in a while some feller wuz darin' enough t' wear a smooth face, but he
                        wuz soon drowned out o' th' conversation. If a young bare faced squirt
                        proposed t' a girl she would call him fer his presumption an' say: "Begone!
                        When you kin show me a neat velvety mustache I'll talk business, but not
                        until." A girl used t' believe that a feller that could work up t' a firm,
                        evenly spaced mustache could easily master all th' later problems in
                        life.</p>
                    <p>A few architects still stick t' th' ole time Van Dykes an' we occasionally
                        meet a government employe who stands defiantly under th' civil service laws
                        wearin' a hedge. Th' trailin' arbutus, or Wild Bill mustache, is almost
                        extinct. It wuz undermined above th' lip an' allowed t' droop from either
                        corner o' th' mouth after th' fashion o' cypress moss. In some sections
                        where land sells fer eighty cents per acre we not infrequently encounter
                        human bein's wearin' a tangled mass interspersed with cow licks. Virgin

                        southern Indianny when it came upon a feller wearin' neatly trimmed chin
                        whiskers with th' hair line dropped fully an inch below th' lower lip, th'
                        intervenin' space bein' carefully parked. Otherwise th' feller seemed
                        intelligent enough an' asked many questions showin' that he took a weekly

                    <p>"Forty-three years th' last time Bryan spoke here. It wuz a sour note that
                        put me in th' business. I'd been thrown in daily contact with a yaller
                        clarinet when a child an' at th' age o' fourteen, after I had it about
                        two-thirds subdued, I ran away with a circus as a canvas hand. One night
                        durin' a performance while th' band wuz playin' `In th' Sweet Bye an' Bye'
                        th' clarinetist dropped a sour note closely resemblin' th' terrifyin' cry o'
                        a panther an' th' audience stampeded an' nine people wuz killed. Th'
                        clarinet player wuz discharged an' I took his place. I traveled many years
                        with circuses with varyin' success. Once I walked home from Tombstone,
                        Arizony. At another time I wuz poisoned on canned corn at Hurley, Wisconsin,

                        of a gold an' green combination bandwagon an' hyena cage I had a fine

                    <p>"After you took up th' cornet what wuz your favorite solo?" I made bold t'
                        ask th' aged virtuoso, profferin' a second se-gar as a guarantee o' good
                        faith.</p>

                        without further se-gars: "Joinin' a band wuz th' hight o' ever' lad's
                        ambition in th' ole days. It wuz th' turnin' point in his life. Belongin' t'
                        th' band wuz th' steppin' stone t' th' purtiest girl in town. Epaulets an' a

                        mellow notes o' a slip horn or a second alto they wuz well nigh
                        irresistible. But th' hardest thing about belongin' t' a band in the ole

                    <p>When we look at th' great mass o' literature that tests th' capacity o'
                        bookstores an' newsstands we can't help thinkin' what a scramble ther must
                        be fer even standin' room in th' field o' literature. Most anybuddy roundin'
                        forty kin easily remember th' day when two or three family story papers, a
                        couple o' magazines, a stock o' Ned Buntline's yeller backs, an illustrated
                        pink weekly devoted t' crime an' th' prize ring an' "Lovell's Library"
                        constituted what wuz regarded at th' time as a first class book an' news
                        depot. "Lovell's Library" wuz made up of paper backed novelsï¿½thrillin'
                        stories of adventure an' heart meltin' tales o' loveï¿½by such celebrated
                        writers as Wilkie Collins, Clark Russell, Mrs. Henry Wood. Ouida, Hugh
                        Conway, Charlotte Braeme, Robert Buchanan an' Th' Duchess. Th' great

                        line o' current literature. In th' average home th' cartin' away o' th'
                        accumulated literature has come t' be as much <pb id="VAA2451-051" n="[]"/>
                        of a problem as th' removal o' ashes an' garbage. A literary disposal plant
                        is one o' th' urgent needs o' th' times. On returnin' from a week's vacation
                        one has t' tunnel thro' th' great drifts o' papers an' magazines t' reach
                        th' front door.</p>
                    <p>Ther's no longer any mystery about how th' other half o' th' world lives. It
                        writes. Fer ever' mail box ther's an amateur writer. As th' day draws t' a
                        close he may be seen skulkin' along thro' th' shadows t' a mail box bearin'
                        a thick reel o' manuscript addressed t' some magazine publisher. He knows
                        some magazine needs it t' balance up its advertisin.' When a magazine editur
                        returns a manuscript it's because he hain't got room fer it. It's no sign he
                        has read it. Writers know that. They jest remail it t' some other editor.
                        Th' great difficulty in contributin' t' th' magazines is knowin' which
                        magazine needs your stuff. When a magazine editur rips open a story he
                        counts th' pages an' calls t' his assistant: "George, kin we use about
                        twenty-eight hundred words next month?" an' George answers <pb
                            id="VAA2451-052" n="[]"/> right off th' bat (bein' throughly familiar
                        with th' number o' ads): "Yes, it'll jest balance up th' ads."</p>
                    <p>Th' amateur author never gits discouraged. Sometimes he drys up fer a week or
                        ten days, but he's soon at it agin. He knows that ther must be somewhere
                        some editur that's holdin' his forms open fer his story an' he mails it an'
                        remails it till he hits th' right editur.</p>
                    <p>Writin' looks awful easy, an' most of it must be awful easy. That's th'
                        reason so many neglect ther personal appearance an' become writers. I've
                        often thought I'd lay off some afternoon an' write a novel. But writin' fer
                        magazines is th' best sport. It's as lazy an' fascinatin' as fishin'. You're
                        your own master. You don't even have t' be available. Jest so your story is
                        long enough or short enoughï¿½jest so th' editor has rook fer it.</p>
                    <p>When we reflect that Pilgrim's Progress wuz writt'n in jail, that Silvio
                        Pellico an' Tasso did ther best writin' behind th' bars, that Sir Walter

                        Daniel Defoe laid th' plans fer Robinson Crusoe while he wuz in a lock-up we
                        must confess that th' world t'day is lenient indeed.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">By Prof. Alex Tansey</head>
                    <p>Personal magnetism is that quality in human nature which enables a feller t'
                        git by with a red carnation in his lapel an' little ability--that
                        indefinable somethin' which enables us t' appeal t' others with success.</p>
                    <p>Personal magnetism, like th' squash, may be cultivated an' developed, an' th'
                        reward, as in th' case o' th' squash, is allus fer in excess o' any trouble
                        or expense incurred.</p>
                    <p>Th' next time you see a promoter, or a politician, carefully study his
                        magnetic quality. He may not have a warm, soggy clasp o' th' hand or a
                        fireman's mustache, an' he may not be dressed accordin' t' th' magazine ads
                        or belong t' any loges. But ther's somethin' about him which attracts you t'
                        him. At first he may impress you as bein' a hoss doctor, or one interested
                        in th' culture o' bees, but after you're under his spell fer a moment you
                        feel a crumblin' sensation. You realize he's got your number an' that it's
                        useless t' plead. We've <pb id="VAA2451-059" n="[]"/> all bought life
                        insurance or a hat or somethin' else we didn' want while under th' same
                        spell.</p>
                    <p>Magnetism means social as well as financial <figure entity="VAA2451-9">

                        money.</p>
                    <p>Th' first step in developin' personal magnetism is t' learn t' be cheerful
                        tho' bored. A <pb id="VAA2451-060" n="[]"/> wide radiant smile is th'
                        foundation o' magnettism. But a smile t' be effective must have a well
                        ordered background. Th' teeth should be plugged an' evened up. After you've
                        mastered th' art o' smilin' an' bein' cheerful begin t' train yourself t'
                        sayin' an' doin' only agreeable things, rememberin' that one little mean act
                        'll counteract a whole day's smile.</p>
                    <p>In your battle t' become magnetic you'll often become discouraged as your
                        effort t' avoid causin' friction in other natures will be fraught with many
                        difficulties. This is where a strong heart with an overhead valve comes in
                        handy if th' best results are t' be achieved. As you proceed you'll attract
                        new friends. You'll be asked t' join clubs an' lodges, an' lead parades.</p>
                    <p>O' course if you're well fixed you kin do without personal magnetism. But if
                        you're jest startin' out in life with a piano half paid fer personal
                        magnetism is invaluable.</p>
                    <p>What a pity it is that so many o' us refuse t' become acquainted with our own
                        great powers, but instead prefer t' struggle along an' <pb id="VAA2451-061"

                        without eggs. Th' breakfast table looks cold an' uneventful without th' warm
                        golden orbs of a few upturned eggs. Ther is no understudy fer th' egg. An

                        th' summer breezes many a bride an' groom will have returned from Pendleton

                    <p>Rev. Wiley Tanger says marriage is an achievement. It prob'ly is an
                        achievement t' round up some girls, an' it may be somethin' closely
                        resemblin' an' achievement t' hypnotize some fellers an' railroad 'em t' th'
                        altar. But the plain, ever' day Niagry Falls marriage kin hardly be called
                        an achievement any more than fallin' over a wheelbarrow in th' dark an'
                        escapin' with your life. Fer a man an' wife t' find 'emselves settin' on th'

                        world after bein' harnessed t'gether fer fifty years is an achievement.</p>
                    <p>Th' reason nine-tenths o' th' marriages come nearer bein' calamities than
                        achievements is because at th' very moment a young couple <pb

                        would you git?" or "I don't care fer ice cream if you don't." Sometimes a

                        Then she'll say, "I don't want you t' spend your money on me, Albert," which
                        is jest another way o' sayin', "We'll need it after we're married." After
                        th' weddin' comes th' ole time honored "If I'd only known" o' th' wife, an'
                        "If I wuz only single agin' " o' th' husband.</p>
                    <p>Some married couples are tactful enough t' hold t'gether, others split up,
                        some arbitrate, some keep on fourflushin' in public an' fightin' at home,
                        while those who have been on th' level from th' time they first met live
                        happily ever afterward because they knew jest what they were gittin'.</p>
                    <p>A husband or wife should have some occasional diversion outside th' home. If

                    <byline>By Ex-Editur Cale Fluhart</byline>
                    <p>There's three kinds o' spring — forward, backward an' th' plain almanack
                        variety, which arrives with th' vernal equinox on th' twenty-first day o'
                        March, rain or snow.</p>
                    <p>Ther's many harbingers o' spring which are regarded as bein' absolutely
                        trustworthy signs that th' season which we long fer is comin' soon." Wild
                        geese flyin' north, marble playin', blue-eyed violets peepin' out o' th'
                        slush, th1 robin, th' shaggy umbreller mender with th' workhouse palor, th'
                        candidate fer sheriff with his fresh hair cut, an' th' display o' onion
                        sets, winter elbows an' garden tools—all are looked upon as bein'
                        unmistakable evidence that winter is beatin' a hasty retreat.</p>
                    <p>While we're liable t' burn more coal after th' arrival o' th' first robin
                        than we've burned since he took his departure, he's still th' most highly
                        regarded forecaster o' th' vernal season in th' business.</p>
                    <p>Th' political candidate has been fooled so <pb id="VAA2451-095" n="[]"/>
                        often by th' first robin that he withholds his activities till th' umbreller
                        mender shows up an' th' frost is out o' th' court house steps an' it's balmy
                        enough t' lean agin th' pustomce. We rarely have any sleighin' after th'
                        ambitious office seeker gits his neck shaved an' his cards printed.</p>
                    <p>But t' return t' th' first robin. Nature, in spite o' her celebrated
                        reputation fer lookin' out fer ever'buddy, seems t' have given th' robin th'
                        worst of it. Unequipped fer anything colder than 30 above, he's more
                        frequently th' forecaster of a blizzard than th' dandelion. Un-gressive an'
                        meek, he'd sooner starve than question th' priority o' th' English sparrow.
                        Th' only thing a robin '11 attack is th' blind, helpless, squirmin' angle
                        worm. Yit nature sends him north a full four weeks before the angle worm is
                        available. Utterly lackin' in th' instinct t' keep away from his natural
                        enemies he invariably selects a buildin' site within easy reach o' th'
                        family cat, or in th' roof gutter, where he an' his family fall an easy prey
                        t' th' April freshet.</p>

                    <p>But th' amount o' publicity th' first robin gits is enough t' make th'

                    <p>How many times have we drawn th' curtain in th' mornin' an' looked out upon a
                        bleak, snowy landscape an' beheld th' first robin with a sad fer away look
                        in his eye, an' wonderin' what kind of a meteorological disturbance nature
                        wuz goin t' hand him next.</p>

                        Icelandic accordion player, while hidin' in a box stall at th' livery stable
                        t' avoid th' entertainment committee o' th' Ladies Art Society. "In no other

                        has about reached th' limit in this country. In time th' <pb

                        licity they wouldn' stand a minute fer th' average celebrity trailer. It
                        seems t' be as much a part o' th' contract o' a celebrity t' stand fer bein'
                        bored all th' time as it is fer em t' play or sing or speak.</p>
                    <p>What a tryin' ordeal it must be fer a Nor-wegion xyclophone player, or a
                        Scandanavian 'cellist, or a Peruvian pianist, or a noted exponent o'
                        altruism, t' be surrounded by a bunch o' perfumed an' powdered tea pourers
                        while he feels th' need o' a bath, or a shave, or a steak with onions.</p>
                    <p>Some celebrities, o' course, travel in ther own special cars an' kin sleep
                        an' shave while they hide on a side track in th' suburbs, but they've all
                        paid th' price early in ther careers.</p>
                    <p>It's great fun t' watch a reception committee while it waits fer th' train

                        a fire drill. Ever' contingency is provided fer, Th' committee huddles
                        t'gether with grave an' sober faces. Each member is thoroughly sensible o'
                        his great responsibility. Each thinks only o' th' part he <pb

                        case watch is all that disturbs th' quiet vigil. Th' committee knows its
                        business. When th' whistle blows it's th' signal fer th' leadin' hardware
                        merchant t' crank his Ford an' have it in readiness. Th' leadin' banker an'
                        prominent pastor move t' a position where th' coach bear-in' th' celebrity
                        is likely t' halt. It is th' pastor's business t' greet th' celebrity an'
                        pass his luggage t' th' leadin' banker. At this juncture th' mayor who has
                        remained in th' offin' walks forward an' extends a fat damp hand an' escorts
                        th' party t' th' Ford. Then th' celebrity is spirited t' th' home o' a
                        prominent club woman, where th' committee on entertainment take him in
                        charge. At eight-ten p. m., after eatin' an' shakin hands an' inspectin' th'
                        new water works an' th' heatin system o' K. of P. hall, th' celebrity
                        appears pale an' exhausted fer th' evenin's entertainment.</p>

                        chances are she'll have t' git out o' town. Gittin' talked about is one o'

                    <head>Th' Liver</head>
                    <byline>By Dr. Mopps</byline>
                    <p>Th' shameful treatment that is bein' accorded th' human liver in this day an'
                        age is a reflection on our boasted civilization. We're rushin' ahead unitin'
                        oceans, reducin' th' tariff, passin' currency bills an' checkin' hog cholera
                        while th' great American liver struggles along doin' two livers' work
                        without a friend in either branch o' Congress.</p>
                    <p>Th' human liver (Swedish LEFVER) is a large light maroon colored digestive
                        gland about the size of a catcher's glove that reposes in th' upper right
                        hand corner o' th' abdominal cavity an', when conditions are as they should
                        be, it weighs one-fortieth as much as th' body t' which it is attached. It
                        is th' main gazabo o' th' human works but, notwithstandin' th' important
                        role it plays in our pursuit o 'life, liberty an' happiness, it is th' most
                        abused, most misconstrued, most ignored, most imposed on, most neglected an'
                        lied about organ <pb id="VAA2451-114" n="[]"/> of which th' medical
                        fraternity has any knowledge.</p>
                    <p>Next t' a yeller dog ther hain't nothin' that <figure>
                            <p>WHEN TH' LIVER IS HITTIN' RIGHT.</p>
                        </figure> responds as readily t' kindness as th' human liver. Prunes, when
                        properly stewed, are fine fer th' liver, but how many of us are darin'
                        enough t' ask for them? We occasionally eat <pb id="VAA2451-115" n="[]"/> an
                        apple jest t' please th' liver, but we rarely take th' liver int' our
                        confidence when we attend a Jefferson Day banquet. We are not chummy enough
                        with th' liver. How many of us have any knowledge of it's plumbin'?</p>
                    <p>A feller's disposition is regulated by his liver. Th' liver is th'
                        switchboard o' his inclinations an' impulses. We often hear it said of a
                        feller that he entered int' this er that with his whole heart. It wuz his
                        whole liver. Most o' th' credit that goes t' th' heart rightfully belongs t'
                        th' liver.</p>
                    <p>Some fellers are very lavish till ther asked t' do somethin' fer ther liver.
                        Next t' a poor relative ther hain't nothin' they're less interested in than
                        ther own liver. Some girls laughin'ly powder over a liver spot on ther cheek
                        without ever thinkin' of goin' t' th' seat o' th' trouble,</p>
                    <p>One o' th' hardest things that come up durin' th' liver's daily routine is
                        handlin' a large steak after its owner has consumed it an' sunken heavily
                        int' an easy chair.</p>
                    <p>When th' human liver (Latin JECUR) is <pb id="VAA2451-116" n="[]"/> happily
                        situated an' th' lines leadin' therefrom are open t' traffic ther is nothin'
                        that looks as bright an' beautiful as th' world.</p>
                    <p>Ther's gittin' t' be too many thirty-cent people that look like a million
                        dollars.</p>
                    <p>So many clerks seem t' have missed their callin'.</p>
                    <p>Some folks never begin t' figure till ther's nothin' t' add.</p>

                    <p>Th' trouble with most men an' women who chase after popularity without makin'

                    <p>Ther's two kinds o' popularity—th' real, inexpensive, natural finish, or
                        uncommon variety, an' th' smilin', smirkin', flashy, shim-merin' short-lived
                        sort which depends entirely on one's willin'ness t' come across.</p>
                    <p>Th' ultimate obscurity that seems t' be th' inevitable fate o' all who have
                        known th' glamor of a brief, wasteful season o' popularity is often
                        pathetic. T' be suddenly, or even gradually, torn from those who have
                        laughed at your jokes, those who have used you an' fattened on your vanity,
                        those who have got ahead thro' your generosity an' those who have shown you
                        a good time no matter how much it cost you, is one o' th' common an'
                        pitiable spectacles o' life.</p>

                    <p>Popularity is fleetin'. It is here t'day an' gone t'morrow. It vanishes
                        before sudden adversity like a paper dollar on Saturday night. Popularity is
                        like a babe. It must be nursed an' cuddled lest it withers an' fades. As it
                        thrives its unkeep increases.</p>
                    <p>It's as hard t' build up a long neglected popularity as it is t' put a run
                        down hotel back in th' game. T' keep his popularity in good runnin' order a
                        feller should be a nice even tempered goat with a kind word an' a good

                        advent o' th' raspin' phonograph!</p>
                    <p>When it comes t' din th' blatant notes o' a minstrel pe-rade are as soft an'
                        soothin' as a summer zepyr compared t' th' turmoil an' clatter o' th' march
                        o' progress, with its player pianners, typewriters, automobiles, addin'
                        machines, belchin' motorcycles, nickel the-ater megaphones, flat wheeled
                        street cars, hospital ambulances an' rumblin' interurbans. With th' possible

                        are accompanied by some nerve rackin' noise. Wherever we turn we run int'
                        some new kind of a noise. The quiet Sunday at home passed out with th'
                        comin' o' th' player pi-anner. Th' wheezin' graphophone has <pb

                        </figure> meditation after another. If we seek th' lonesome seclusion o' th'
                        country lane we're startled by th' auto horn or snortin' motorcycle. In th'
                        cafe th' low necked cabaret nightingale <pb id="VAA2451-133" n="[]"/> sings
                        "You Made Me Love You" as she wabbles aimlessly among th' tables scatterin'
                        talcum dust o'er th' steaks an' caviar sandwiches. Ever'where is noise. In
                        ever' town that's flourishin' enough t' support a "Pearl" laundry or a
                        "Weekly Banner" we find th' fussy little gasoline engine puffin' like an
                        enraged wart hog brought t' bay. Thro' th' turmoil an' bustle o' traffic we
                        cross th' downtown street with our life in one hand an' a cane or a mackerel
                        or somethin' in th' other. In th' evenin' when we git ready t' retire some
                        neighbor decides t' try out a new grand opery record on th' Victroly, 'or
                        th' blushin' debutante next door grows tired o' holdin' hands an' concludes
                        t' do a little foot work on th' player pianner. At intervals thro' th' night
                        we're aroused by th' milkman as he whistles his way t' th' window sill t'
                        keep up his courage, or by th' rough voice o' th' street sweeper as he
                        curses his mules. In th' mornin' th' wide open muffler o' some early
                        chauffeur proclaims th' breakin' day. Once .back in th' city streets we hear

                    <p>Nothin' seems t' succeed these days without a noise. Th' prosperity o' our
                        towns an' cities is measured by ther noise. Even a feller's prominence is

                    <p>Not long ago I wuz strollin' along th' street in th' residence district o' a
                        city when I came upon two youngsters who were discussin' croquet. Suddenly
                        th' older o' th' two said, "Hurry! Beat it! Here comes th' Main Squeeze!"
                        an' they both rushed panic stricken across a lawn an' were soon lost in th'
                        shrubbery. Turnin' about I saw a pompous gentleman ap-proachin'. His chin
                        wuz well up an' he seemed t' be entirely unconscious o' th' fact that any
                        other livin' thing existed besides himself. That he wuz a gentleman o' rare
                        ability ther could be no doubt, but in what callin' or profession he
                        excelled I wuz unable t' figure out. I walked leisurely t' th' corner an'
                        halted. I wished t' study him at close range. My hopes were shattered when
                        he turned t' enter th' residence across th' lawn of which th' boys had <pb

                        or seemed t' fergit th' fact that he wuz great. His bearin' never changed.
                        He entered th' house, an* thro' a window I caught a last glance o' him. His
                        chin wuz still up. I wuz much interested. I asked a gentleman who chanced t'
                        pass who lived in th' house. He replied "Th' cashier o' some public service
                        monopoly. I've never heard his name."</p>

                        sensible fellers would like t' git married but they can't afford t' take th'
                        time an' money. If a feller could git married after a week's sparkin' he
                        might be able t' catch even again. But th' modern girl seems t' demand a
                        long extravagant courtship before she's willin' t' give in an' drop out o'
                        th' game. Then th' young husband finds himself bankrupt with a yeller cane,
                        a plug hat, a dress suit an' a doll on his hands. With each spurt o' economy
                        her love grows colder. He gits tired o' lookin shiny an' her muff goes out
                        o' date. A separation soon follers—th' wife returns t' her ole home on
                        Chestnut street an' th' husband joins his regiment on th' rialto.</p>

                    <byline>By Dr, Mopps</byline>
                    <p>We're livin' in an age o' sharp competition, when no element is so
                        indispensable as boldness in th' attainment of all that is desirable in
                        life. A finished education, purty hair, an' unimpeachable character, finely
                        chiseled features, th' form of an Apollo, a fine tenor voice, fashionable
                        raiment an' good folks avail but little in th' battle o' life when
                        unaccompanied by th' element o' boldness—or nerve.</p>
                    <p>Boldness is a positive characteristic o' th' spirit. A feller may be bold
                        thro' fearlessness, but he may be fearless without bein' bold. He may be
                        fearless where there is no apprehension o' danger or no cause fer
                        apprehension, but he is bold only when he is conscious or apprehensive o'
                        danger an' has th' nerve t' encounter it.</p>

                        nerve.</p>
                    <p>Th' best maxims o' t'day were written almost a century ago, an' if they
                        fitted condi- <pb id="VAA2451-151" n="[]"/> tions as they existed then how
                        much truer are they t'day when th' minds an' energies o' th' most
                        resourceful amongst us are often exhausted in an effort t' even rise above
                        mediocrity. If "Strike when th' iron is hot" meant anything in 1836 how much
                        more must it mean t'day? If he who hesitated fifty years ago wuz lost what
                        chance is ther t'day fer th' feller who says, "I'll think about it?"
                        "Nothin' ventured nothin' won" wuz a pop'lar sayin' long before th' death o'
                        Cornwallis, an' yit t'day ther's folks tryin' t' succeed without
                        adver-tisin'.</p>
                    <p>So in our modern system o' reachin' th' front boldness is th' all important,
                        over shadowin' pre-eminent an' dominant requisite. If we're t' git a seat on

                        KNOCKIN',</p>
                    <p>Ther's allus been a little knockin' goin' on here an' there since th'
                        beginnin' o' time, but it has operated under th' sobriquet o' backbitin' an'
                        wuz widely scattered. But somehow it got in with the' vanguard o' our
                        country's progress an' t'day it is regarded as a matter o' course, jest th'
                        same as th' typesettin' machine an' th' straight front corset. It is one o'
                        our established customs. It seems t' be impossible t' make th' most
                        commonplace remark without leadin' up t' a knock. Th' one thing above all

                        fer a burst o' laughter er th' low mumblin' tones o' th' organ that they may
                        put over a well aimed knock without bein' heard. At th' banquet table, where
                        good cheer an' friendship are supposed t' abide, th' knocker sits with glass

                    <head>Th' Little Town</head>
                    <byline>By Rev. Wiley Tanger</byline>
                    <p>Stew Nugent is at home t' put his feet under his mother's table. He has been
                        t' th' city fer three years an' says that th' trouble with a little town is
                        that ever'buddy knows ever'bud-dy else's business. That's th' reason Stew
                        went away, an' it's one o' th' best things about a little town. You know who
                        your next door neighbor is, an' you know who lives over th' hardware store.
                        An' you know who's able t' own a tourin' car.</p>
                    <p>In a city where you don't need no other credentials but a good front it's
                        different. Some folks flourish in a city that couldn' git trust fer a box o'
                        corn flakes in ther home town. Some fellers apologize fer livin' in a little
                        town. When you ask 'em where ther from they color up an' stammer an' say,
                        "I— er—why—I—I'm from Rossville—that is my folks live ther. I've been livin'
                        ther too, but I'm thinkin' o' goin' t' Chicago. Ther's no opportunities in a
                        little town fer a young man." <pb id="VAA2451-163" n="[]"/> An' when you
                        size him up you can't help pic-turin' what a flurry he'll cause in Chicago.
                        O' course some folks that go t' th' city succeed, but they've got th' ole
                        home metal in 'em.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>In th' great city parks th' benches are filled with poor unfortunates from
                        th' little towns who have tried an' failed. Pride alone keeps <pb
                            id="VAA2451-164" n="[]"/> 'em from returnin' an' they become aimless
                        wanderers an' are lost an' fergotten in th' mist o' time.</p>
                    <p>Some folks jist seem t' be cut out fer th' artificiality o' th' city, an'
                        that's where they ought t' live. But if you want t' live an honest, quiet,
                        peaceful life an' enjoy th' love an' confidence o' your friends an'
                        neighbors, ther's no place like th' little town where one-half th' people
                        knows how th' other half lives, where respectability is a real asset, where
                        a K. of P. watch charm won't save you if you can't toe th' mark, an' where
                        you're remembered long after th' hearse gits back t' th' livery stable.</p>
