            The War Hawks and the War of 1812
            
                    Editor's Note
                
            Historians have differed widely about the underlying causes of the War of 1812. Their writings
                    concerning its background, however, have emphasized four basic factors: the prolonged controversy
                    and conflict over neutral rights during the two decades preceding the War of 1812; English
                    impressment of American seamen during these two decades; the role of the English in supporting the
                    Indians of the Old Northwest against the Americans from the 1780's; and the desire of
                    Americans to gain part or all of 
                        Canada
                     as a result of conflict with 
                        England
                    . Some writers have given their attention to all of these factors, while others have
                    devoted their emphasis mainly to questions concerning neutral rights and impressment.1
            
            Most historians have given the War Hawks a major responsibility for the congressional declaration of
                    war against 
                        England
                     in June, 1812. Two historians, Professors Reginald Horsman and Roger H. Brown,
                    presented papers at a session on "The War Hawks and the War of 1812" at the
                    fifty-sixth annual meeting of the 
                        Mississippi
                     Valley Historical Association held at Omaha, 
                        Nebraska
                    , May 2-4, 1963. The two articles which follow are modified versions of these papers,
                    but the basic views and conclusions of the authors remain unchanged. The comments on the articles by
                    Professors Alexander DeConde and Norman K. Risjord have also been reworded, but their basic views
                    and conclusions are also unchanged. The articles and comments are presented in the order in which
                    they were given at Omaha.

                        Brown
                    , DeConde, and Risjord have all given substantial time to research and writing regarding
                    the period of the War of 1812. Horsman's book, The Causes of the War of
                    1812, is cited in both the following articles. He has written

                    University in 1958.

                        Stanford
                     University, where he received the Ph.D. degree in 1949, and taught at

                        Michigan

                        American Foreign Policy, published by Scribner in 1963. Risjord's article,
                    "1812: Conservatives, War Hawks, and the Nation's Honor," is cited in
                    both the following articles. He received his doctorate in history from the University of 
                        Virginia
                     in 1960; in September, 1964, he will join the University of

            These articles and comments do not attempt to evaluate the fundamental or underlying causes of the
                    War of 1812. Instead, attention is focused on two questions: was there a group in the first session
                    of the Twelfth Congress3 with enough cohesion and consensus to warrant the
                    appellation of War Hawks and, if so, did the War Hawks have a major role in bringing on the War of
                    1812? All other questions raised in the articles and comments are subordinate to these queries.
                    Horsman's article is largely a statistical and analytical study of the voting records of
                    members of the House of Representatives on eleven "measures leading toward war"
                    during the first session of the Twelfth Congress. 
                        Brown
                    's attention is mainly on the views expressed by twenty-seven members of this
                    session of Congress, senators as well as representatives, in contemporary personal letters and
                    records.

                        1813. Most of the members of the House of Representatives had been elected in their respective
                        states during the summer and fall of 1810, although some were elected as late as the spring of
                        1811. Senators at that time were chosen by the state legislatures.
            
         
         
         
            Who Were the War Hawks?
            
                    Reginald Horsman
                    ∗
                
            Among the more eccentric features of the strange little War of 1812 was the manner in which the
                    American Congress wrangled through more than six months of debate in an attempt to resolve whether
                    war should be declared against 
                        England
                    . The whole affair was reported daily in a British press which delighted in telling its
                    readers that the American legislators were now debating whether the thousand-ship British navy could
                    be defeated by the addition of ten frigates or four seventy-fours, or whether perhaps a war could
                    better be fought with no navy at all. The aura of unreality which surrounded the proceedings of this
                    Twelfth Congress was epitomized on June 4, 1812, when the declaration of war finally passed the
                    House of Representatives by a vote of only 79 to 49, not even a two-thirds majority. Seldom has a
                    nation entered a war with less élan.
               1
            
            The manner in which this modest majority was created has received less attention from historians than
                    the general problems of causation. Who were the enthusiasts—those who for six months had
                    consistently argued for war and had supported war measures? Most writers on this subject have been
                    content to assert that the core of war feeling was to be found in the small group which gathered
                    around Henry Clay in the fall of 1811 and from that time on urged war measures and war itself upon a
                    reluctant Congress. Others, however, have identified fifteen or twenty members of the House of
                    Representatives as War Hawks. Bernard Mayo in his excellent biography of young Henry Clay lists over
                    thirty men when he discusses 
                        Clay
                    's supporters in the drive for war. In his recent comprehensive account of
                    these years Bradford Perkins indicates that the Republicans could be divided into four groups, one
                    of them being the War Hawks, and argues that five men—Henry Clay, Langdon Cheves, William
                    Lowndes, John C. Calhoun, and Felix Grundy—formed the core of the war party in the House
                    of Representatives. Though he never formally lists those who could be

                     called War Hawks, in the course of his arguments Perkins uses
                    the term in references to a number of others, including John A. Harper, Joseph Desha, William R.
                    King, Anthony New, and William Widgery in the House, and George M. Bibb and George W. Campbell in
                    the Senate.2
            
            Most historians who have worked in this period could probably agree on a hard core of four or five
                    men who formed a nucleus of war sentiment. If, however, they were asked to list the other War Hawks,
                    there might be considerable disagreement. Who were those men who from the beginning of the Twelfth
                    Congress were determined that the 
                        United States
                     should go to war and who spent the next six months convincing their often reluctant
                    colleagues that war was a desirable step? Though some information can be gleaned from contemporary
                    correspondence and diaries, it was in the debates and votes on the floor of Congress that the
                    supporters of war made their public affirmation.
            Two problems occur when the debates and votes are used as a basis for identifying the war enthusiasts
                    in the Twelfth Congress. The first difficulty arises from the method of reporting debates in the Annals of Congress. Unlike the Congressional Record of
                    today—where the difficulty is to sift the spoken word from a huge deposit of the
                    unspoken—the Annals err on the side of frugality. At times one has to
                    be content with such cryptic comments as "Mr. LACOCK spoke in favor of the
                    report," from which even the most optimistic of historians would have difficulty
                    ascertaining Abner Lacock's motives or degree of enthusiasm. It is possible, nevertheless,
                    to use the Annals to some effect in identifying the war enthusiasts from their
                    remarks in debates of the House of Representatives; the reporting of Senate debates, however, is so
                    scanty as to preclude the usefulness of the Annals for identifying the senators
                    who supported war.3
            
            The second difficulty appears when one begins to analyze the votes. One might legitimately conclude
                    that a representative who voted for every measure leading toward war that came before the House
                    between November, 1811, and June,

                     1812, could be listed as at least a silent supporter of the
                    conflict. The situation, however, was not so clear cut. Though there generally seemed to be a
                    Republican majority in favor of war with 
                        England
                    , there was a striking lack of party unanimity on the best methods of fighting the war.
                    Some representatives, headed by Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun, thought that all minor or even major
                    disagreements on specific policy should be subordinated to a firm drive toward war. Other members of
                    the House, though apparently supporting war, were unwilling to ignore their particular prejudices.
                    For example, a considerable group—the most notable among them was Felix Grundy of 
                        Tennessee
                    —though otherwise seeming to favor war, could not agree that a navy was
                    needed to fight it; they argued that any navy that could be built would be swept from the seas by 
                        England
                    , would saddle the 
                        United States
                     with a huge debt, and would in the long run subvert American liberty. Another group,
                    otherwise pressing for war, could not agree to the taxes that would support it; they seemed afraid
                    that Congress would pass the taxes, and then, perversely, refuse to declare war. Other groups
                    opposed the authorization of a large increase in the armed forces or did not want the militia to be
                    used outside the 
                        United States
                    . Since these groups and individuals overlapped, the votes for war measures in the
                    Twelfth Congress are remarkably confused. There were few who would vote for every measure tending
                    toward war, regardless of their particular prejudices, and some of those who were most ardent in
                    their support of war voted against specific war measures. The votes were further complicated by
                    Federalist efforts to embarrass the administration. At times members of the Federalist opposition
                    were enlisted in favor of what was in effect a war measure, and prowar Republicans were to be found
                    voting against it. In spite of all this, however, it is possible to discern patterns in the voting
                    of members of the House and, combined with the debates, the voting does help to identify the real
                    enthusiasts for war.4
            
            The House of Representatives which assembled in Washington in November, 1811, consisted of 142
                    members. Though party lines were not firmly drawn, there were approximately 106 Republicans and 36
                    Federalists. Sectional lines were less distinct than party lines, but it is possible to give general
                    indications of sectional strength. The newer states of the

                  Ohio, Kentucky
               , and 
                        Tennessee
                    
               5 together had only ten members in the House; one of these, Henry
                    Clay, became speaker. The South Atlantic states—
                  Maryland, Virginia
               , North and 
                        South Carolina
                    , and 
                        Georgia
                    —had 55 representatives; the New 
                        England
                     states—
                  Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut
               , and 
                        Rhode Island
                    —had 35 representatives; and the Middle Atlantic
                            states—
                  New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania
               , and 
                        Delaware
                    —had 42, of whom the great majority (35) were from 
                        New York
                     and Pennsylvania.
            While it is obviously difficult to draw lines of division between New 
                        England
                     and the Middle Atlantic states, there is some reason for considering the five South
                    Atlantic states and the three 
                        Mississippi
                     Valley states as separate areas with distinctive interests. In some accounts of the
                    coming of the War of 1812 much stress has been laid on a western-southern alliance. Others have
                    pointed out, however, that though the representatives of the 
                        Mississippi
                     Valley states cast nine and those from South Atlantic states cast thirty-seven votes
                    for war, thirty-three other votes had to be obtained from the Middle Atlantic states and New 
                        England
                    . In view of the fairly large number of votes for war that came from outside those
                    areas, is there any validity in crediting a western-southern alliance with bringing about the
                        war?6
            
            An analysis of the debates in the Twelfth Congress does support the view that congressmen from the
                    West and the South were vital to the movement for war against 
                        England
                    . Indeed, they appear to have had a far greater importance in promoting war during the
                    first six months of the session than they did in the actual vote in June, 1812. Though the reporting
                    of debates in the Annals of Congress is inadequate, it does indicate the main
                    speakers, the gist of their arguments, and some of their enthusiasm and vigor. If one includes 
                  
                     5
                            
                                Louisiana
                             was admitted to statehood in April, 1812, but the representative to the Twelfth
                            Congress, Thomas B. Robertson, did not take his seat until December, 1812.
                  
                     6 The historiography of the war to 1940 is discussed in Warren H.
                            Goodman, "The Origins of the War of 1812: A Survey of Changing
                            Interpretations," 
                        
                                    Mississippi
                                 Valley Historical Review, XXVIII (September, 1941), 171-86. For
                            publications on the war since 1940, and for a survey of the war period, the bibliographies
                            and references in Perkins, Prologue to War, and in Reginald Horsman, The Causes of the War of 1812 (

                            , 1962), are useful. There is also discussion of recent work in this field in
                            Norman K. Risjord, "1812: Conservatives, War Hawks, and the Nation's
                            Honor," William and Mary Quarterly, XVIII (April, 1961), 196-210,
                            and in Bradford Perkins (ed.), The Causes of the War of 1812: National Honor or
                                National Interest? (
                                New York
                            , 1962).
               
                     among the ranks of the War Hawks those who in the winter of
                    1811-1812 spoke actively for war as the only way out of America's dilemma and urged action
                    upon the dilatory American Congress, the House debates reveal that only some twenty-one
                    representatives can be called War Hawks. Among them are found such familiar names as Henry Clay of 
                        Kentucky
                    ; John C. Calhoun, Langdon Cheves, and William Lowndes of 
                        South Carolina
                    ; Felix Grundy of 
                        Tennessee
                    ; and John A. Harper of 
                        New Hampshire
                    .7
            
            When these twenty-one members of the House are viewed in terms of the regions they represented, a
                    clear pattern emerges. By far the largest number—twelve—came from the South
                    Atlantic states. The next largest number—five—came from the 
                        Mississippi
                     Valley states. The Middle Atlantic states had only two reasonably articulate supporters
                    of the war; one was Peter B. Porter of 
                        New York
                    , chairman of the House foreign relations committee, and the other was Adam Seybert of
                    Pennsylvania. And only two outspoken war advocates came from New 
                        England
                    ; one of these was John A. Harper of 
                        New Hampshire
                    , a man who lived on the outer fringes of that state, and the other was William Widgery
                    of 
                        Massachusetts
                    . Widgery's arguments, however, were at times somewhat equivocal, and it could
                    well be argued that he should not be called a true War Hawk.
            Congressional debates, however, do not provide a truly reliable estimate of the support that any
                    individual was giving to a particular course of action, and an attempt to discover the War Hawks on
                    the basis of the debates is obviously impressionistic. A more effective method of discovering the
                    true war enthusiasts in the Twelfth Congress is to examine the votes taken in the period from
                    November, 1811, to June,

                     1812. At least it should indicate how many consistently voted
                    for measures leading toward war, though the voting patterns are confused by those who supported war
                    measures in the hope of persuading 
                        England
                     to yield.
            The number of key House votes in the Twelfth Congress was not excessive. During most of the winter of
                    1811-1812 they covered three main aspects of war preparation—military, naval, and
                    financial. By April, 1812, the votes were on measures leading directly to the actual conflict. For
                    the purposes of this paper eleven votes were studied; they include the important and some of the
                    less important measures.
            The first of the three votes on military matters to be examined was the measure to increase the
                    regular army. The bill, which had been passed by the Senate and sent to the House, called for an
                    increase of 25,000 men; it was amended in the House foreign relations committee to call for only
                    15,000 additional men. After debate the House reinstated the 25,000 figure but was willing to
                    provide initially for only part of the commissioned officers needed for the increased force. The
                    amended bill passed the House by a large majority on January 6. The second vote to be considered
                    took place on this same measure three days later after the Senate had declined to accept the major
                    House amendments. On January 9 the House reluctantly decided to agree to the Senate version of the
                    bill. Those who urged the House to yield to the Senate on this issue argued that a quarrel with the
                    Senate (even if justified) would only serve to slow down war preparations. The third military
                    measure examined was that calling for volunteers; this passed by a substantial margin on January 17
                    after a bitter argument over whether the militia could be used outside the country.8
            
            Two votes on naval matters were reviewed. The first, which provided for the arming of merchantmen,
                    passed with little opposition on December 19, 1811. The second was the proposal to eliminate from
                    the navy bill the clause calling for the building of new frigates. This passed by three votes on
                    January 27, 1812, defeating the efforts of those, including Henry Clay, who wanted to increase the
                    navy in order to combat 
                        England
                     on the seas.9

                        Ibid., 565-66, 999.
            
            
            On financial matters three votes were examined. The first was the defeat on February 28 by three
                    votes of the resolution to levy a tax of 20 cents on each bushel of imported salt. The second was
                    the reconsideration and passage of this same resolution by twelve votes on March 2. The third was
                    the agreement on March 4 to accept all the tax resolutions taken together. These were the taxes
                    which it was presumed would enable the 
                        United States
                     to fight a war against 
                        England
                    .10
            
            The other three votes examined include two that were basic to the declaration of war and the
                    declaration itself. On April 1, 1812, by a vote of 70 to 41, the House passed a sixty-day embargo
                    (subsequently increased to ninety days by the Senate) which was looked upon by those who argued for
                    it as a direct precursor of war against 
                        England
                    . On April 25 the House agreed by the narrow margin of seven votes to postpone
                    indefinitely the subject of an adjournment. This proposal had gained support earlier in the month
                    but was opposed by most war advocates, who viewed it as a means of delaying, and possibly avoiding,
                    a decision. Finally, on June 4, 1812, the House approved a declaration of war against 
                        England
                     by a vote of 79 to 49.11
            
            It can be argued that the ardent enthusiast for war would have voted affirmatively on ten of these
                    eleven issues, the exception being the proposal to eliminate from the naval bill the section calling
                    for the building of new frigates. Thus a war advocate would have voted for an increased army in
                    spite of the manner in which the Senate had imposed its will on the House; would have supported the
                    arming of merchantmen and the building of new frigates in spite of western warnings that a large
                    navy would lead to bankruptcy and despotism; would have agreed to the various taxes in spite of
                    historic Republican objections to such impositions; would have advocated the sixty-day embargo as a
                    measure which would lead directly to war; would have opposed adjournment as a vacillating device to
                    avoid a decision; and finally, on June 4, would have voted triumphantly for war. Such consistency
                    was exceedingly rare.12

                        133.
            
            
            Only five members of the House had perfect records on behalf of the war party, although it can be
                    assumed that the speaker, Henry Clay, would also have supported the war party on all these measures
                    if he had been eligible to vote. Of the five, only one—John C. Calhoun of 
                        South Carolina
                    —is really well known and spoke ardently in the Twelfth Congress. The other
                    four consistent supporters of war—two from 
                        Massachusetts
                     and one each from 
                        Maryland
                     and 
                        North Carolina
                    —were content to vote rather than speak.13
            
            Though those with perfect records are rare, the list is increased somewhat if one includes those who
                    never cast a ballot against the move for war, but were absent or did not vote on one or more
                    occasions. This adds nine who had perfect records; seven of them were from the South. Five of the
                    nine—Peter B. Porter of 
                        New York
                    , Burwell Bassett of 
                        Virginia
                    , William Blackledge of 
                        North Carolina
                    , Langdon Cheves of 
                        South Carolina
                    , and George M. Troup of 
                        Georgia
                    —are also to be found among the band of twenty-one or so who urged war in the
                    debates of that winter. Of this group of fourteen men who cast no adverse votes on the measures
                    tending toward war, ten were from the South Atlantic states, one from the Middle Atlantic states,
                    and three from New 
                        England
                    . Representatives from the South Atlantic states dominated numerically in this group
                    just as they did in the debates of the Twelfth Congress.14
            
            When one considers those congressmen who though generally supporting war measures did on one occasion
                    vote in opposition to the core of the War Hawks, another definite trend becomes evident. Some
                    thirteen representatives cast one vote which might be said to have injured the war effort. Ten of
                    these thirteen disagreed with naval preparations; eight of the ten—Felix Grundy of 
                        Tennessee
                     and William R. King 
                  
                     13 These four were Isaiah L. Green and Charles Turner, Jr., of 
                                Massachusetts
                            , Peter Little of 
                                Maryland
                            , and Willis Alston of 
                                North Carolina
                            .
                  
                     14 The four others in this group of nine were Obed Hall of 
                                New Hampshire
                            , Samuel Ringgold of 
                                Maryland
                            , James Pleasants of 
                                Virginia
                            , and Richard Winn of 
                                South Carolina
                            . Two who cast no adverse votes have been omitted; they are Francis Carr of 
                                Massachusetts
                            , who did not take his seat until June, 1812, and so voted only on the war
                            declaration, and Daniel Avery of 
                                New York
                            , who voted on only three of the eleven measures.
               
                     of 
                        North Carolina
                     were among them—opposed the plan to build frigates, and
                    two—William Lowndes of 
                        South Carolina
                     and Alexander McKim of 
                        Maryland
                    —opposed the arming of merchantmen; two of the remaining three would not
                    accept the Senate version of the army bill, and one opposed the tax on imported salt. Once again the
                    majority—seven in this group of thirteen who voted only once against war
                    measures—was from the South Atlantic states. In addition, three were from the West, three
                    from the Middle Atlantic states, and none from New 
                        England
                    .15
            
            Thus some twenty-seven representatives can be included among those who attended most of the session,
                    voted on most occasions, and yet cast no more than one vote against those measures which were
                    leading toward war against 
                        England
                    . Seventeen of these twenty-seven were from the South Atlantic states, four from the
                    Middle Atlantic states, three from the West, and three from New 
                        England
                    . The three—four counting 
                        Clay
                    —from the West were of course out of a total representation of only ten,
                    whereas the three from the New 
                        England
                     states were out of a total of thirty-five. One surprising factor, however, is that less
                    than half of those who had spoken as War Hawks in debate are to be found in this group of consistent
                    voters for war measures.
            If the net is spread farther to include those who cast only two votes that hindered the war effort,
                    then eighteen more members of the House can be included in the regular war party. This group, like
                    those who voted once in opposition, showed greatest dissatisfaction on the issue of naval
                    expansion—seventeen of the eighteen were opposed to the plan to build more frigates. Most
                    of the other opposition votes were related to the withdrawal of the House from its amendments to the
                    Senate armed forces bill; there were also some votes against the arming of merchantmen and the tax
                    on imported salt. The sectional pattern becomes far less distinct in this group of eighteen: the
                    South Atlantic and Middle Atlantic states contributed seven and six representatives 
                  
                     15 The other nine who voted once in opposition were Lewis Condict of 
                                New Jersey
                            ; William Anderson and Abner Lacock of Pennsylvania; John Clopton, John Dawson,
                            Thomas Newton, and John Roane of 
                                Virginia
                            ; and Anthony New and Stephen Ormsby of 
                                Kentucky
                            . Six of this group of thirteen missed one or more votes.
               
                     respectively; New 
                        England
                     contributed two and the West three.16
            
            This brings to forty-five the total number of representatives who cast no more than two adverse votes
                    on the eleven war measures under consideration. Though the detailed account is difficult to follow,
                    the broad outlines are reasonably clear. In these key tests of support for war against 
                        England
                     most of the opposition was related to naval expansion, which was attacked as an
                    expensive luxury that would bring the 
                        United States
                     to bankruptcy and would endanger the republican form of government. Twenty-five of the
                    forty-five representatives who generally supported the war effort voted against the proposal to
                    build additional frigates for the 
                        United States
                     navy.
            When one adds to the forty-five already studied the sixteen representatives who cast three votes in
                    opposition to the war drive, the feeling against naval expansion becomes even more apparent.
                    Thirteen of these additional sixteen opposed the proposal to build new frigates. Most of the other
                    opposition votes in this group were directed against the Senate armed forces bill and the tax on
                    imported salt.17
            
            There were, then, sixty-one representatives who can be described as usually giving their support to
                    measures leading to war. The sectional alignment of these sixty-one members of the House is fairly
                    distinct: ten were from New 
                        England
                    , fifteen from the Middle Atlantic states, twenty-nine from the South Atlantic states,
                    and seven from the West. Eighteen of the twenty-one who can be considered the vocal supporters of
                    war in the debates of the Twelfth Congress are included 
                  
                     16 These eighteen were Samuel Shaw and William Strong of 
                                Vermont
                            ; Ebenezer Sage of 
                                New York
                            ; William Findley, John M. Hyneman, Aaron Lyle, Adam Seybert, and George Smith
                            of Pennsylvania; Stevenson Archer and Joseph 
                                Kent
                             of 
                                Maryland
                            ; Peterson Goodwyn of 
                                Virginia
                            ; William Butler, Elias Earle, and Thomas Moore of 
                                South Carolina
                            ; William W. Bibb of 
                                Georgia
                            ; John Sevier of 
                                Tennessee
                            ; and Joseph Desha and Richard M. Johnson of 
                                Kentucky
                            . Two others, Robert LeRoy Livingston of 
                                New York
                             and Meshack 
                                Franklin
                             of 
                                North Carolina
                            , cast only two adverse votes, but neither was recorded on the eventual vote for
                            war.
                  
                     17 These sixteen were James Fisk of 
                                Vermont
                            ; Samuel Dinsmoor and John A. Harper of 
                                New Hampshire
                            ; Ebenezer Seaver and William Widgery of 
                                Massachusetts
                            ; James Morgan of 
                                New Jersey
                            ; Roger Davis, Joseph Lefever, Jonathan Roberts, and John Smilie of
                            Pennsylvania; Aylett Hawes, William McCoy, Hugh Nelson, and John Taliaferro of
                                    
                        Virginia; Israel
                      Pickens of 
                                North Carolina
                            ; and John Rhea of 
                                Tennessee
                            . One other who cast only three adverse votes, Ezekiel Bacon of 
                                Massachusetts
                            , has been omitted since he was not recorded on the vote for war.
               
                     among these sixty-one representatives. The exceptions are
                    Samuel McKee of 
                        Kentucky
                    , Robert Wright of 
                        Maryland
                    , and David R. Williams of 
                        South Carolina
                    . The records of all three are somewhat surprising. McKee and Wright both spoke for war
                    in Congress but, for varying reasons, managed to cast four votes out of the eleven against war
                    measures. McKee was bitterly opposed to naval expansion and thought the war could be won by an
                    invasion of 
                        Canada
                    . He voted against the arming of merchantmen and the building of new frigates, would not
                    yield from his support of House amendments to the army bill, and did not wish to see the matter of
                    adjournment postponed indefinitely in late April, 1812. McKee was an outspoken and independent
                    westerner. Wright's chief stumbling block was the question of taxes. He opposed the tax on
                    imported salt, its reconsideration, and the general tax resolution which was passed early in March,
                    1812. Wright also opposed the arming of merchantmen. Williams, though speaking for war, voted
                    positively on only four occasions of the eleven and missed four votes; he opposed the arming of
                    merchantmen and the building of frigates, and did not want the adjournment postponed in April, 1812.
                    The manner in which these three managed to speak for war and at the same time vote against various
                    measures which were to make it possible typifies the difficulties of the war party in the Twelfth
                    Congress.
            The whole period from November, 1811, to June, 1812, demonstrates clearly the importance of the five
                    South Atlantic states in bringing about the war. These states provided half of the sixty-or-so
                    regulars who could reasonably be depended upon to support war measures. The West could offer little
                    numerically, but its representatives were usually—and often
                    enthusiastically—in favor of war. The Middle Atlantic states provided more total votes
                    but they had more representatives in opposition than the West, and New 
                        England
                     contributed less than a third of her representation to the ranks of the more than sixty
                    who generally supported war measures.
            When an attempt is made to single out the twenty or thirty true enthusiasts—the War Hawks
                    who harangued and finally persuaded the other members of the House that war was the only way out of
                    the American dilemma—the part played by the South and West becomes even more evident.
                    Some 50 per cent of the representatives from the West and over 20 per cent of those from the South
                    Atlantic states  worked actively for war; less than 6 per cent
                    of those from New 
                        England
                     and less than 3 per cent of those from the Middle Atlantic states were in this
                    category. These percentages mean little in detail, but the general impression they give is
                    reinforced by the voting records. Some twenty-seven representatives cast not more than one vote
                    tending to hinder the war effort out of the eleven votes considered here. Among these the South
                    Atlantic states had almost 31 per cent of their representatives, the West 20 per cent, and the
                    Middle Atlantic states and New 
                        England
                     together had less than 10 per cent. Both the debates and the voting records show the
                    South and West by far the most enthusiastic supporters and advocates of the drive for war.
            Though the party allegiance of the members of the Twelfth Congress is not always distinct, all
                    twenty-one of those who supported the war in the debates of the House of Representatives can
                    reasonably be classified as Republicans; the same is true of all the sixty-one who gave most support
                    to the various war measures. The main support for war after November, 1811, came from a combination
                    of western and southern Republicans. The true enthusiasts were remarkably few, but they were able to
                    enlist a solid group of Republicans to vote with them on most of their measures and eventually
                    obtained enough beyond this solid core to pass a declaration of war.
            The records of the Twelfth Congress abound in instances of the difficulties which beset the advocates
                    of war. Even those who were willing to speak in its behalf were frequently unwilling to support the
                    measures which would make it possible. It is not uncommon for nations to go to war in a burst of
                    enthusiasm or desperation and worry later about the specific details of conducting the war. In 1811
                    and 1812 the 
                        United States
                     argued over the details, announced her difficulties to the world, and painfully crawled
                    toward war. The difficulties were great. The true enthusiasts—the War
                    Hawks—certainly numbered less than forty, and it can be argued that there were fewer than
                    thirty. And the total group that usually could be depended upon to support war measures was not much
                    more than sixty. Out of a House of Representatives of 142 members this was a remarkably poor
                    representation on which to base a war. It is surprising not that it took six months for war to be
                    declared, but that it was declared at all.

                  19 Individual voting records are given on the following selected measures
                        numbered 1 to 11 in the table: (1) Resolution calling for the arming of merchant vessels.
                        Passed, 97-22, December 19, 1811. Annals of Congress, 12 Cong., 1 Sess.,
                        565-66. (2) Senate bill, as amended by the House, to increase the regular army by 25,000 men.
                        Passed, 94-34, January 6, 1812. Ibid., 691. (3) Motion to revoke a House
                        amendment to the Senate armed forces bill. Passed, 67-60, January 9, 1812. Ibid., 717-18. (4) Bill authorizing the President to accept and organize certain volunteer
                        military corps. Passed, 87-23, January 17, 1812. One of the affirmative votes was not listed and
                        the analysis does not consider that vote. Ibid., 800-01. (5) Motion to strike
                        out the building of frigates from the navy bill. Passed, 62-59, January 27, 1812. Once again the
                        analysis does not consider one vote. Ibid., 999. (6) Resolution to levy a tax
                        of 20 cents a bushel on imported salt. Defeated, 57-60, February 28, 1812. Ibid., 1114-15. (7) Second vote on the resolution to tax imported salt, after the vote to
                        reconsider. Passed, 66-54, March 2, 1812. Ibid., 1127. (8) Agreement to all
                        the tax resolutions taken together. Passed, 56-34, March 4, 1812. Ibid., 1155.
                        (9) Embargo bill. Passed, 70-41, April 1, 1812. Ibid., 1598. (10) Motion to
                        postpone indefinitely the question of adjournment. Passed, 62-55, April 25, 1812. Ibid., 1341-42. (11) Declaration of war. Passed, 79-49, June 4, 1812. Ibid., 1637. Y — Yea; N — Nay; a blank — the
                        representative was absent or not voting.
               
                  20 (R) — Republican; (F) — Federalist. The table
                        gives only a general idea of the comparative strength of Republicans and Federalists since those
                        who could be designated Republicans were split into many factions. Niles'

            The War Hawks of 1812: An Historical Myth

            Historians have long presumed the existence of a belligerent Republican faction, the War Hawks,
                    genuinely bristling and warm for a war with Great Britain. Urged by economic grievances,
                    expansionist designs, a hypersensitive sense of national honor, or simply the conviction that no
                    other course remained open, these men, led by Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun, drove their more
                    reluctant colleagues into a contest for which the country was ill-prepared.1
                    Federalist opponents of the war, men not privy to the views of Republicans, coined the term War
                        Hawk.2 They relied on false appearances. No Republican ever answered this
                    description. There were differences among Republicans as to the time for beginning hostilities and
                    the initial strategy to be followed. But there is no firm evidence of heedless bellicosity among
                    either the Republican leaders or the rank and file.
            The immediate cause of the Republican declaration of war in 1812 was the apparent determination of
                    Great Britain to maintain her Orders in Council limiting American commerce with Napoleonic Europe.

                     this issue had become clear during their negotiations with the
                    British minister to the 
                        United States
                    , Augustus J. Foster, held in Washington in July, 1811. Following these negotiations the
                    two American leaders came to the conclusion that Great Britain would not repeal the Orders in
                    Council unless compelled to do so by armed force. 
                        Monroe
                     described this conclusion as follows: "Nothing would satisfy the present
                    ministry of 
                        England
                    , short of unconditional submission, which it was impossible to make. This fact being
                    completely ascertained, the only remaining alternative, was to get ready for fighting, and to begin
                    as soon as we were ready."3
            
            That the refusal of Great Britain to repeal left no alternative but force was also the basis of
                    Republican war sentiment in Congress. Letters written by twenty-seven Republican members of Congress
                    from every section of the country—south, west, and north—show Republican
                    representatives and senators agreeing with President Madison and Secretary Monroe that diplomacy
                    unsupported by force no longer offered any hope of redress. The correspondence of Jesse 
                        Franklin
                    , a veteran Republican senator from rural 
                        North Carolina
                    , illustrates how one member of Congress felt on the question. In 1813 
                        Franklin
                     told a constituent: "I voted for the war but not untill I believe that every
                    effort had been made to preserve the peace of the nation that every point of the political compass
                    had been trid. and every Honorable offer made to the present enemy, notwithstanding what may be said
                    by those in the opposition." 
                        Franklin
                    's statement represents the views of Republican members of Congress who
                    believed that force and force only would induce Great Britain to cease her maritime aggressions.4

                        negociation—and look to a war or a most base and disgraceful submission as the only
                        alternatives," George M. Bibb to Charles Scott, February 23, 1812,

                        statements by twenty-four additional members, see Roger H. Brown, "A Republic in Peril:
                        The Crisis of 1812" (Ph.D. dissertation, Dept. of History, 
                            Harvard
                         University, 1959).
            
            
            Recent writing on the causes of war in 1812 strongly supports this thesis. Norman K. Risjord,
                    Bradford Perkins, and Reginald Horsman, in publications that have appeared within the last three
                    years, all agree in locating the basis for war in a feeling that the peaceful policies of diplomacy
                    and commercial restrictions, operative since 1806, no longer offered hope of redress. Nevertheless,
                    significant differences arise among these writers on the matter of when and how Republicans reached
                    this consensus. Risjord and Horsman see the process as one of gradual conversion, a process that
                    began with the agitation of war advocates as early as 1809, then gathered strength and numbers as
                    more "conservative" Republicans gradually joined their ranks. Perkins, on the
                    other hand, finds no war advocates until late 1811 when by word and action a belligerent wing of the
                    party began forcing peace-minded "scarecrow men" and "moderates"
                    into hostilities.5
            
            It is true that some Republicans had given up all hope in peaceful methods as early as 1809.
                    Certainly one was George Washington 
                        Campbell
                    , senator from 
                        Tennessee
                    . 
                        Campbell
                     told a colleague in the winter of 1811-1812: "There appears at present no
                    honorable ground upon which war can be avoided—a change in the measures of G. Britain
                    towards us could alone preserve peace—and there is no stronger reason to calculate on
                    such an event now, as than there has been for several years past." And William H. Crawford,
                    senator from 
                        Georgia
                    , put no confidence in anything less than war if the embargo were repealed. Early in
                    1809 he wrote: "When the embargo is repealed, war, or submission is plain ground, but all
                    between, is mere whipping the devil round the stump." But their numbers were
                    limited—a handful. Wilson Cary Nicholas of 
                        Virginia
                    , a Republican leader in the House of Representatives, resigned from Congress in 1809
                    rather than go along with another try at peaceful measures. At that time he wrote to former
                    President Thomas Jefferson that few agreed with him. If a war bill were to be introduced,
                    "the vote wou'd be small"; given such a state of antiwar opinion,
                    "you can judge how little probability there is that I cou'd

                     have been of the least service." Nicholas'
                    resignation is a measure of his isolation in 1809.6
            
            We may learn much on this point from the views of the two most famous members of the Twelfth
                    Congress—Henry Clay of 
                        Kentucky
                     and John C. Calhoun of 
                        South Carolina
                    . It is undeniable that both men were important in the final march toward hostilities;
                    working closely with the administration, they helped to shape much of its program and guide it
                    through the House. Both men, their letters and speeches clearly demonstrate, believed the country
                    had before it only the two alternatives of war or submission. 
                        Clay
                     in November wrote an acquaintance that we must have war with Britain.
                    In December he voiced confidence that Americans would support the administration in its views and
                    policies "now that war was the only alternative left to us by the injustice of one of the
                        powers."7 Calhoun, too, saw no other way out. Addressing the House
                    he declared: "The extent, duration, and character of the injuries received; the failure of
                    those peaceful means heretofore resorted to for the redress of our wrongs, is my proof that it [war]
                    is necessary." One month before war began he wrote a former schoolmate: "War, I
                    regret, has become unavoidable."8
            
            There is no clear evidence that 
                        Clay
                     and Calhoun had been for war before the fall of 1811. Contrary to frequent accounts 
                        Clay
                     did not press for war in 1810 when addressing Congress. True, he did at that time tell

                        Canada
                     is in your power," and when peaceful commercial resistance "is
                    abandoned without effect, I am for resistance by the sword." But he also
                    made it very clear that the time for forcible resistance had not yet come. He then proposed either a
                    more stringent nonimportation law or congressional authorization for arming merchant ships to take
                    effect after another negotiating attempt. In the early months of 1811 he intimated that Britain
                    still might repeal her Orders in Council. In August, 1811, he told a party colleague that repeal was
                    possible, but that if Britain did not follow 
                        France
                    's example by repealing her edicts, war would be
                    "inevitable." During the war session he said again and again, in public and
                    private statements, that war had now become necessary owing to British
                        intransigence.9
            
            Nor does Calhoun appear to have advocated war before the fall of 1811. Nowhere in the first volume of
                    his papers is there any indication that before that time he believed war necessary. His biographer,
                    Charles M. Wiltse, hypothesizes that Calhoun campaigned for Congress in 1810 on a war program.10 Yet during the war session Calhoun seemed concerned as to how his
                    constituents would take the prospect of a coming British war: his letters suggest that he was
                    anxious about their response to war and its financial burdens.

                            , 1944), 51, 53. Wiltse's evidence for his contention that Calhoun
                            campaigned for Congress in 1810 on a war platform is, in my judgment, inconclusive. I can
                            find no supporting evidence in Correspondence of John C. Calhoun, ed. J.
                            Franklin Jameson, Annual Report of the American Historical Association for the
                                Year 1899, Vol. II (Washington, 1900), which Wiltse cites. Other sources given by
                            Wiltse consist of the personal reminiscences of a former editor of the

                                Report of the American Historical Association for the Year 1899, II, 65-89. But
                            none of these sources states explicitly that the campaign of 1810 was fought on the issue of
                            war or that Calhoun at that time advocated war. The most they suggest is that 
                                South Carolina
                             voters were disgusted with the members of the Tenth Congress who had voted to
                            repeal the embargo.
               
                     Would he have been unsure had he campaigned and been elected on
                    a war platform in 1810? There are other indications he followed the line of thought of 
                        Clay
                    . "Experience," he told a friend in February, 1812, had proved
                    commercial restrictions and negotiation to be "improper for us." Again, he told a
                    correspondent in May, 1812, that regretfully war "has become unavoidable";
                    military preparations, he implied, had proved no more successful than previous measures in bringing 
                        England
                     to yield. As Bradford Perkins has accurately perceived, "most congressmen came
                    to Washington in the fall of 1811 unpledged, probably undecided."11
            
            Precisely when and how did the members of Congress reach consensus that no alternative remained but
                    war? A close study of congressional correspondence for the period November, 1811, to June, 1812,
                    shows widespread agreement developing among Republican members during the first month of the
                    session. President Madison's message, transmitting the results of the negotiations of July,
                    1811, with the British minister and recommending military preparations, reached Congress on November
                    5. As a result, Republicans in the House and Senate quickly agreed in general terms that it had
                    become necessary to devise some new policy to protect American commerce. As George Poindexter,
                    delegate from the 
                        Mississippi
                     Territory, observed shortly after receipt of the message: "We cannot tell what
                    will be done, until the Committees report. No one has suggested a specific measure; but all agree
                        that something must be done."
               12
            
            Still, there had yet to develop among Republicans an agreement as to what, exactly, the new policy
                    should be. Perceiving the incoherent state of opinion, Representative William Lowndes of 
                        South Carolina
                     complained on November 7 that "the want of some controuling or at least
                    concentrating influence" was "very obvious." On this basis members

                     could predict that impending reports of the House and Senate
                    foreign relations committees would afford the needed rallying point. Calhoun noted at this time that
                    members were "generally very anxious as to the course that will be persued" and
                    predicted that the report of the House foreign relations committee "will in a great measure
                    determine the course that will be persued."13 On November 29, Chairman
                    Peter B. Porter of 
                        New York
                     presented the report of the House committee. After reviewing past efforts to induce
                    repeal of the Orders in Council—commercial restrictions, appeals to justice, repeated
                    negotiations—and describing Britain's obduracy in maintaining her Orders, the
                    committee, as Porter subsequently declared, "did not hesitate to give it as their opinion
                    that we ought to go to war in opposition to the Orders in Council."14
            
            Following presentation of this report, Republican opinion began moving swiftly toward a war position.
                    It is clear that the document made an impact on Republicans and brought into sharper focus incipient
                    ideas and tentative positions. The rapid development of agreement is to be seen in the sudden
                    confidence of Republicans that there would be war. In mid-November Representative Jonathan Roberts
                    of Pennsylvania had complained that the "house wants [lacks] men to take the lead"
                    and confessed: "In politics I know not whether to say we shall have bold & great
                    measures or not." On November 30, the day following the report, he could write with
                    assurance: "I think these principles will go into effect—& they must
                    speedily lead to peace or War." A week later on December 8 he told his brother:
                    "Congress will declare War against Britain if she does not do us justice before we rise. I
                    shall vote for it." Following the report other members were confident Congress would
                    declare war. On December 2 Representative John A. Harper of 
                        New Hampshire
                     affirmed: "I feel no hesitation in saying, that the present Session will not
                    be closed, without an arrangement, or an actual war with

                     Great Britain." Many other Republicans believed with
                    George Poindexter that "We shall assuredly have war."15
            
            There were Republicans—very few at most—who did not back war until well into
                    the session when retreat from war seemed impossible without absolute disgrace. Representative John
                    Smilie of Pennsylvania was one. He admitted that at the beginning of the session he had been for
                    commercial restrictions, not war. He had been against the 25,000-man army, "but as the
                    House have determined otherwise he would now go to war—if we now recede we shall be a
                    reproach among all nations." It is unlikely there were many others. Calhoun—who
                    certainly should have known—believed that a majority had felt that war was necessary and
                    that the "same sense of the justice and necessity of the [war] measures, which originally
                    induced Congress to adopt them, will also coerce us to resort to that last redress of a
                    nation's wrongs."16
            
            It is doubtful that there were many "bluffers" among those Republicans who
                    originally supported measures of military preparation, hoping Britain would retreat under the threat
                    of hostilities but having no idea of war if she did not. Members frankly and openly expressed hopes
                    that military preparations still might possibly produce repeal. Representatives William Findley of
                    Pennsylvania and Hugh Nelson of 
                        Virginia
                     both avowed that military measures might prevent war, but both men were clearly willing
                    to vote for war if threats proved unsuccessful. But this was true of virtually all Republicans, who
                    clung to a dim hope that preparations might possibly produce British repeal and would have rejoiced
                    in such an event. Calhoun expressed the party sentiment

                     when he wrote in May, 1812: "War, I regret, has become
                    unavoidable. I did hope, 
                        England
                     would have returned to a sense of justice, when she saw this country determined to
                    avenge her wrongs."17
            
            No Republican genuinely hoped for war or joined the consensus that war had become necessary with any
                    other feeling than deep reluctance and regret. Thus Nathaniel Macon asked the rhetorical question of
                    his congressional colleagues whether there was "a man in the House" who
                    "wishes to go to war if it could possibly be avoided?" Jonathan Roberts accurately
                    perceived this mood when he wrote in January: "There seems to be no disposition to relax
                    our war measures but I beleive [sic] every body would be exceeding glad to remain
                    at peace, the federalists seem sanguine the orders in council will be revoked—I confess I
                    hardly allow myself to hope it."18
            
            These men did not minimize or close their eyes to the disadvantages and evils of war. Historians have
                    portrayed the leaders as bellicose, fervent, enthusiastic, and heedless as to the evils of war. A
                    reading of their correspondence suggests that this does not do them justice. A few Republicans
                    foresaw danger in a standing army, a swollen national debt, corruption of public virtue, and a
                    possible alliance with Napoleon. All foresaw hardships and dangers in war—casualties,
                    expenses, taxes, and commercial and business losses. The nation's military and naval
                    establishments were weak. There was great concern as to whether public opinion would wholeheartedly
                    and unitedly support war against Great Britain at this time with all the hardships and sacrifices it
                    entailed, and which Federalists were bound to exploit.19

            Calhoun, for example, was particularly anxious on this score and expressed fervent hopes that
                    Americans would show courage and patriotism in support of the war. "God grant that the
                    people may have sperit to maintain our interest and honor in this momenteous period." He
                    showed anxiety in other ways. He kept careful and close track of military preparations, called at
                    the war department to learn the progress of recruiting, showed relief when informed of advances in
                    stockpiling military supplies, and betrayed regret and discouragement at the slow pace of
                    preparation and the President's lack of vigor and leadership.20
            
            Henry Clay was aware of many difficulties and dangers ahead. Following news of the famous Battle of 
                        Tippecanoe
                     between the forces of Governor William Henry Harrison and those of Tecumseh at the
                    Prophet's Town early in November, instead of calling for immediate chastizement of hostile
                    tribes, he expressed hopes that "as the Indians were repulsed, they will not be disposed to
                    prosecute the War. It will certainly add to our embarrassments if we have to carry on a war with
                    them, as well as their good friends, the English." One enemy at a time was certainly
                    enough, even for the sanguine-tempered leader from 
                        Kentucky
                    ! Against advocates of 10,000 or 15,000 additional troops he urged authorization of
                    25,000 men, holding that only a force of this strength, with the 10,000-man army already authorized,
                    would be sufficient to defend our coasts and invade 
                        Canada
                     at the same time. One suspects he worried about public support for the war. Did the
                    American people have the necessary qualities to support the hardships of war? 
                        Clay
                     thought probably they did, but he was not altogether certain. "God grant us a
                    happy result to this new & untried experiment to which the only free government upon earth
                    is about to be subjected! That such will be the issue of the contest I entertain no doubt if the
                    people possess the fortitude and firmness which I believe they do." Significantly, he
                    indicated that the expiration date of a short-term embargo, which he proposed to Secretary of State 
                        Monroe
                     in mid-March, should coincide with the return

            Other Republican members of Congress showed much anxiety as to wartime dangers and difficulties.
                    Senator Charles Tait of 
                        Georgia
                     believed that war "is deeply to be regretted," and that we
                    "ought not, if we could, conceal from our view the inconveniences, the suffering, not to
                    say calamities which must necessarily be attendant on a War with G.B." Representative
                    William W. Bibb of Georgia wrote: "So much do I deprecate a war at the present time, and
                    under the existing circumstances of Europe, that I have had great difficulty in bringing my mind to
                    the 'sticking place;' but I consider it unavoidable (unless the steps of our enemy
                    be retraced) without a sacrafice greater in its extent, than will be the calamities of
                    war." House member William Lowndes of 
                        South Carolina
                     was obviously concerned when he told his wife in early November that "the
                    situation indeed of the country is so embarrassing as to divert the attention from individual
                    difficulties." Representative 
                        Israel
                     Pickens of 
                        North Carolina
                     told a constituent that "I could not have come [to Congress] in a more serious
                    & critical moment." Jesse 
                        Franklin
                    , senator from 
                        North Carolina
                    , affirmed "that there is not a man in the nation woud be more rejoiced than
                    myself to see some event that Shoud render our Military preparations unnecessary but we must make
                    the best of a bad Bargain." Representative Stevenson Archer of 
                        Maryland
                     wrote that war "is a calamitous event, & is at all times if possible
                    to be avoided." Representative Samuel L. Mitchill of 
                        New York
                     affirmed that the time had come when "we must combine our strength, try our
                    resources, and atchieve all we can. We must, on this just & necessary occasion, encounter a
                    war, with all its privations, contributions and hardships." Representative Charles Turner
                    of 
                        Massachusetts
                    , describing efforts of his party to arouse the country for war, exclaimed: "On
                    them rests the tremendous responsibility; I feel its pressure; as we need, so I trust we shall have
                    the prayers of all, who wish well to their Country." Representative

                     Felix Grundy of 
                        Tennessee
                    , so often held up as the epitome of irresponsible bellicosity, told Andrew Jackson that
                    a "Seat in Congress, at present, is too responsible a Station to be even tolerably
                    pleasant." George Washington 
                        Campbell
                    , Grundy's Senate colleague from 
                        Tennessee
                    , wrote that the prospect of avoiding war was "very gloomy," and later
                    implied that no Republican took the war lightly when he expressed the hope that "resolution & judgment" would overcome "fears, & apprehensions" in holding men firm for
                    war—for the "honor of our Country—& of human
                        nature."22
            
            True, a good deal was said in debate to suggest that some Republicans were spoiling for a fight with
                    Great Britain. In their speeches men did wax belligerent, they did ignore or minimize the evils of
                    war, and they did predict quick and easy victory. They talked heatedly and emotionally of
                    accumulated British aggressions on national rights and honor—Orders in Council,
                    impressment, British-incited Indian attacks, the Chesapeake affair, and much else.
                    They seemed eager for war, for a chance to get revenge for half a decade of un-redressed injuries
                    and insults. But one should consider the situation they were then facing. The country needed to be
                    aroused. The recruitment of men for the new army, the subscription to the $11,000,000
                    loan, and the conversion of the economy to a war footing, all required the war to seem credible and
                    worthy of sacrifice to private citizens. And how were these objects to be met except by rousing
                    speeches that received a wide circulation through the public prints?23 Henry

                        Clay
                     well understood the problem. His principal argument for a brief embargo in March was
                    that it would "give tone to public sentiment," repress "indiscreet
                    speculation," enable the prudent "to put under shelter before the storm,"
                    and "above all powerfully accelerate preparations for the War."24
            
            One should consider other motives also. While Congress had as yet no official stenographer and kept
                    no record of its debates, such speeches as were taken down by newspaper reporters and printed in the
                        National Intelligencer and other town and country papers reached a wide
                    national audience. The opportunities in the situation should be obvious. While motivation is
                    extremely difficult to prove, there is the case of Jonathan Roberts, a freshman representative from
                    Pennsylvania. Roberts regretted the need for war—"every body would be exceeding
                    glad to remain at peace," he wrote his brother. Yet it was not inconsistent with this
                    attitude for Roberts to wish to seem "active" on his first introduction to the
                    national legislature, or to worry that a speech of his would be so placed, in the Intelligencer's, account, as to appear "to little
                        advantage."25 Observers were probably right when they surmised that
                    members often spoke with an eye to the gallery.26 Possibly, too, members wished
                    to justify their conduct before constituents. Would voters approve their decision for war simply on
                    the basis of Britain's refusal to repeal the Orders in Council? Should they not be reminded
                    of the long catalogue of unredressed aggressions from this hostile power? Finally, the heavy
                    concentration of belligerent speeches during the December debates suggests the possible operation of
                    another motive. A faint hope remained that Great Britain needed only to be convinced that the
                    Republican majority genuinely meant war, and she would repeal the Orders. By January

                     when the time for such warnings to have effect had pretty well
                    passed, speeches became more moderate. Federalists, taking note of the shift in tone, erroneously
                    believed Republicans meant to back out of war. As one Federalist observed at the end of January, the
                    "war fever" seemed to have "all evaporated," thereby confirming
                    his opinion that the war had all along been a bluff.27
            
            In sum, the speeches of individual congressmen afford a false impression of eagerness for war. Fiery
                    and belligerent and oblivious of the consequences as they may seem at first glance, they give a less
                    accurate picture of prevailing reluctance than do private letters. It was undoubtedly with some such
                    possibility in mind that William Plumer of 
                        New Hampshire
                    , a former 
                        United States
                     senator, asked a senatorial acquaintance to write him privately concerning the news of
                    Congress: "By the National Intelligencer, which I regularly receive, I obtain a pretty full
                    account of the debates votes & proceedings of Congress; but it is from private letters only
                    that we can obtain information of the motives views & designs of the Administration
                    & of Congress."28
            
            On the existence of a conflict between War Hawks and "peacemen," the evidence is
                    far from conclusive. There was no consistent division within the party over war measures—
                    the army, navy, taxes, or adjournment—that might reveal such a struggle; the same men may
                    be found on different sides of these issues at different times. There were
                    Republicans—Grundy was one—who were very suspicious of
                    "bluffers" in their own party. But suspicion does not prove fact; indeed, Grundy
                    was suspicious of 
                        Madison
                     and 
                        Monroe
                    , who were not bluffing, although in view of some ambiguous pronouncements they could
                    well have seemed to be.29
            
            To say all this is not to deny the importance of leadership in the Republican march toward war. 
                        Clay
                     and Calhoun deservedly won reputations for their roles in shaping and guiding the
                    Republican war program through the Congress.

                     Their energy and determination impressed members of both
                    parties, and their contribution to the business of legislating the means of war was vital. Without
                    their presence Congress might have been paralyzed in squabbles over the details of war legislation.
            Nor is it the contention of this study that Republicans were generally agreed on the manner and
                    timing of hostilities. A sizable group in the party wanted an undeclared limited maritime war
                    instead of the full-scale hostilities that a declaration of war would bring. Some of the same men,
                    and others, wanted to postpone hostilities until the nation was more adequately prepared. But these
                    were differences over strategy, not over the more fundamental question of war or peace.
            It is contended, however, that the main body of the Republican party was not divided into two
                    factions which differed during most of the session over the question of war or peace; that the great
                    majority of Republicans reached a consensus between the termination of the Foster negotiations at
                    the end of July, 1811, and the report of the House foreign relations committee at the end of
                    November, 1811, that no acceptable alternative to force remained; that most Republicans came to this
                    decision with no little regret and reluctance, however much some might appear in their speeches to
                    be eager and bellicose. If these contentions are correct, perhaps the time has come to relegate a
                    misleading term—"the War Hawks of 1812"—to the realm of
                    partisan misunderstanding and historical mythology.
         
         
         
            The War Hawks of 1812: A Critique
            
                    Alexander DeConde
                    ∗
                
            Causation and its problems have always fascinated the historian. In the literature of American
                    history the exploration of the causes of the War of 1812 has been particularly attractive to the
                    scholar and has led to a number of controversial interpretations. Several recent books, articles,
                    and these two essays by Professors Reginald Horsman and Roger H. Brown show that the interest in the
                    causes of the War of 1812 is as vigorous as ever and the question still open to controversial, and
                    even contradictory, conclusions.
            These two papers attempt to isolate and analyze one element in the chain of causation—the
                    group of men in the Twelfth Congress who favored war and provided the leadership that led to the
                    declaration of war against Great Britain in June, 1812. The identities of all these men, who have
                    been dubbed the War Hawks, have never been entirely clear. Both essays attempt to bring needed
                    clarity to the subject, but each author, after surveying the evidence, offers an argument and a
                    conclusion that seemingly contradicts the findings of the other. It would appear, therefore, that
                    instead of clarifying the issue Horsman and 
                        Brown
                     have added to the interpretive confusion in the historiography of the War of 1812.
            A close reading of the essays and their documentation, however, indicates that the views of these two
                    investigators are not in themselves contradictory. The contradictions stem mainly from methodology,
                    the nature of the data these historians chose to use in support of their theses, and from semantic
                    differences. Horsman not only insists that there were War Hawks, but also that they were important
                    and can be identified with reasonable accuracy—or at least with greater precision than in
                    the past. 
                        Brown
                     argues that the term War Hawks is a misleading one and is based upon myth. In his view,
                    in the sense that the term implies that Republican leaders were bellicose and eager for war, there
                    were no War Hawks in the Twelfth Congress.

                        of

                         at Santa Barbara.
            
            
            While admitting that there are limitations in his methodology, Horsman arrives at his conclusions
                    through a statistical analysis of the debates and votes of the Twelfth Congress on selected issues
                    which he believes were decisive war measures. On the basis of this technique he stresses throughout
                    the essay that western and southern Republicans in the Congress provided the leadership for war
                    against 
                        England
                     and hence were the War Hawks. He maintains that their eagerness for war was not a quick
                    emotional enthusiasm, but a sustained desire running from November, 1811, to June, 1812. Since,
                    according to Horsman's interpretation, the War Hawks were Republican partisans who numbered
                    only about thirty in a House of Representatives of 142 members, it is not surprising that the
                    declaration of war came slowly, even reluctantly.
            
               
                        Brown
                    's argument hinges on this Republican reluctance to vote a declaration of war.
                    "No Republicans," he writes, "genuinely hoped for
                    war…". Unlike Horsman, 
                        Brown
                     maintains that "the speeches of individual congressmen afford a false
                    impression of eagerness for war." A better tool of analysis, he believes, is the study of
                    the private letters of the legislators of the Twelfth Congress. Human motivation and true desires,
                    he maintains, are usually revealed with greater candor in personal correspondence than in public
                    debates. 
                        Brown
                    , therefore, bases his analysis primarily on a study of the private correspondence of
                    the men in the Twelfth Congress who provided the leadership that led to the declaration of war.
            The theoretical basis of 
                        Brown
                    's analysis appears sound and convincing, but its practical application in this
                    case is so difficult that it casts doubt on his sweeping conclusion. While it is seemingly true that
                    men's speeches frequently do not reveal their inner motives, it does not necessarily follow
                    that legislators do not vote their convictions, particularly on war measures. Furthermore, it
                    appears from 
                        Brown
                    's documentation that not all the private correspondence of the members of the
                    Twelfth Congress, or even of the alleged War Hawks, is available for close investigation or for an
                    analysis that can be tabulated. Yet all the votes of the Twelfth Congress are on record and
                    truncated versions of debates are also available for study.
            
            Nonetheless, Professor Brown has performed a valuable service in reiterating that the men of 1812 did
                    not plunge the nation into war in a moment of fiery and belligerent passion; in this sense, he is
                    correct in arguing that they, or their leaders, were not War Hawks. Yet, as he himself admits, some
                    of the Republicans sought war with greater eagerness than others, and actually did provide the
                    leadership that brought a reluctant Congress to declare war. In this sense, then, one can argue that
                    there were War Hawks and, through rigorous analysis as shown by Professor Horsman, that these War
                    Hawks can be identified. Moreover, the term War Hawks has long been a legitimate generalization for
                    the historian to use when describing men who sought war for various reasons, whether in 1812 or at
                    some other time. I see no reason why, especially with reference to 1812, the term should be
                    discarded or relegated to the realm of mythology.
            Regardless of points of view, 
                        Brown
                     and Horsman have written essays that give evidence of careful and extensive research on
                    a significant subject. Even more important, they have applied critical and rigorous analysis to
                    their material, and in so doing have given their subject new meaning. Both have attempted to tell
                    not only what happened, but also how it came about. Horsman has succeeded in defining the term War
                    Hawks with greater precision than have other historians and 
                        Brown
                     has shown how and why the term can be misleading if not used with care. Both essays
                    reveal how important it is for the historian to be self-concious in his methodology and in his use
                    of generalizations in any pattern of explanation.
         
         
         
            The War Hawks and the War of 1812

            Political factions are nebulous things. It is easy to discuss them and their ideas; it is much more
                    difficult to define them with any precision. This laborious task Professor Reginald Horsman has
                    performed for the War Hawks through an examination of voting patterns in the Twelfth Congress. This
                    has enabled him not only to count the War Hawks, but to determine their consistency and the extent
                    of their support for war. And it has enabled him to offer statistical evidence to support the
                    impression gained by all who have read the debates of the Twelfth Congress—that the South
                    provided both the enthusiasm and the votes for war, the West furnished only enthusiasm, and the
                    great silent mass of representatives from the middle states provided only votes.
            Horsman's technique is certainly scientific, but an attempt to extract behavior patterns
                    without reference to personalities or to the historical context can be misleading. For example, he
                    lists the vote to increase the army by 25,000 as a significant war measure, and, indeed, it would
                    appear to be so. The bill actually originated in a Senate committee headed by William Branch Giles
                    of 
                        Virginia
                    , a leading Republican critic of the administration. Since the President had asked for
                    only 10,000 men and there was some doubt that the treasury could finance an army of 25,000, it was
                    widely suspected that Giles was interested only in embarrassing the administration. Secretary of
                    State James 
                        Monroe
                    , at least, felt that the bill actually hindered the war preparations.1 It is quite possible, therefore, that several genuine supporters of war voted against the
                    measure.
            The complex of factions and personalities that made up the Republican party is not revealed by a
                    simple examination of voting patterns. The antiadministration faction in the
                    Senate—frequently called the "invisibles"—had been demanding
                    a warlike policy for years, but their motives were suspect

                     because in the end they got cold feet and tried to block the
                    declaration of war. It seems likely that their belligerence was largely a pose which permitted them
                    to criticize the foreign policy of the President and the fiscal policy of treasury secretary Albert
                    Gallatin. This would explain, for instance, the behavior of Representative Robert Wright of 
                        Maryland
                    , whose verbal demands for war and votes against it seemed to puzzle Horsman. Another
                    enigmatic figure was David Rogerson Williams, representative from 
                        South Carolina
                    , who loudly demanded war yet voted against taxes, the navy, and the expansion of the
                    War Department. Williams was a former Quid who had not completely cast off the spell of 
                        Virginia
                    's Representative John Randolph and the Old Republican "principles of
                    1798."
            This is to argue only that the behaviorist approach needs to be softened by historical perspective
                    and the use of other kinds of evidence. Voting patterns alone reveal little of personal motives,
                    passions, or fears. This, however, is but a minor reservation concerning Horsman's method.
                    With his conclusions no one can disagree.
            While Horsman identifies and counts the adherents of war in the Twelfth Congress, Professor Roger H.
                    Brown denies that the War Hawks even existed as an identifiable faction. The two views, however, are
                    not necessarily incompatible. Horsman's discovery of a remarkably small group of consistent
                    supporters of war is perhaps explained by the reluctance which 
                        Brown
                     observed. Perfect consistency, after all, is too rigid a criterion by which to judge
                    any politician. It is obvious that some people were more eager for war than others. The more
                    reluctant had to be converted gradually, and there was much backsliding—particularly on
                    issues involving Republican principles, such as taxes and the navy.
            With 
                        Brown
                    's thesis that Congress went to war with great hesitation and many misgivings I
                    agree completely. War sentiment evolved only gradually, in company with growing disillusionment with
                    the policy of commercial retaliation. But the evolution of war sentiment began earlier than 
                        Brown
                     suggests—well before the summer of 1811. It should be noted, for instance,
                    that of the twenty-seven representatives listed by Horsman as being most consistent in their votes
                    for war in the Twelfth Congress, seventeen had served  in
                    previous Congresses. And many of these began the process of conversion from Jeffersonian pacifists
                    to War Hawks well before 1811. In connection with my study of the Old Republicans I have had
                    occasion to investigate the extent of war sentiment in the Eleventh Congress (1809-1811), using much
                    the same technique as Horsman. Although the Eleventh Congress never faced a clear-cut issue of war
                    or peace, there were a number of political issues—coastal fortifications, proposed
                    convoys for American merchant vessels, the size of the army and navy—which reveal a
                    certain degree of belligerence. Examining nine such issues, I discovered that fourteen
                    representatives voted consistently for military and naval preparedness and another eighteen stood
                    for warlike measures in all but one of their votes.2
            
            Considering the extent of belligerent sentiment in the Eleventh Congress revealed by these statistics
                    (only twenty-seven men had a similar record in the Twelfth Congress, although the issues there were
                    more clearly defined), why did the Eleventh Congress appear so weak and vacillating? 
                  
                            
                        2 The nine measures indicating the belligerency of the Eleventh
                                Congress are: (1) Motion to reduce the appropriation for coastal fortifications.
                                Defeated, 47-84, June 8, 1809. Annals of Congress, 11 Cong., 1 Sess.,
                                255-56. (2) Motion to sell the gunboats. Defeated, 53-73, June 22, 1809. Ibid., 392-93. (3) Motion to call up for a vote the bill to provide armed
                                convoys for American merchant vessels. Defeated, 50-61, April 12, 1810. Annals of Congress, 11 Cong., 2 Sess., 1790-91. (4) Resolution to reduce the
                                army. Passed, 81-31, April 17, 1810. Ibid., 1883-84. (5) Resolution to
                                reduce the navy. Passed, 65-46, April 17, 1810. Ibid., 1884-85. (6)
                                Resolution to reduce both the army and the Navy. Passed, 60-31, April 17, 1810. Ibid., 1885. (7) Amendment to the navy bill to strike out section
                                reducing the number of frigates. Passed, 76-32, April 25, 1810. Ibid.,
                                1977. (8) Amendment to the navy bill to strike out section reducing size of marine
                                corps. Passed, 49-43, April 25, 1810. Ibid., 1982. (9) Amendment to
                                the navy bill reducing the navy to the 1806 level. Passed, 49-35, April 28, 1810. Ibid., 2014-15.
                            Republican representatives who voted consistently for preparedness included eight
                                northerners (Orchard Cook and Gideon Gardner of 
                                    Massachusetts
                                ; John Nicholson, Ebenezer Sage, and Thomas Sammons of 
                                    New York
                                ; William Anderson and William Findley of Pennsylvania; and James Cox of 
                                    New Jersey
                                ), five southerners (John Brown, Alexander McKim, Nicholas R. Moore, and
                                Roger Nelson of 
                                    Maryland
                                ; and Thomas Newton of 
                                    Virginia
                                ), and one westerner (Benjamin Howard of 
                                    Kentucky
                                ). Republican representatives who voted for preparedness on all but one
                                issue included an additional eight northerners (Jonathan Fisk and Erastus Root of 
                                    New York
                                ; David Bard, William Crawford, John Porter, and George Smith of
                                Pennsylvania; and Adam Boyd and Henry Southard of

                                ), eight southerners (John Montgomery of 
                                    Maryland
                                ; John Clopton, John Dawson, Walter Jones, John Love, and John Roane of 
                                    Virginia
                                ; and Joseph Calhoun and Richard Winn of 
                                    South Carolina
                                ), and two westerners (Pleasant Miller and John Rhea of 
                                    Tennessee
                                ).
                        
               
                     Why was the issue of war never squarely faced? I can only
                    conclude that it was a lack of leadership. The administration offered no encouragement, and
                    congressional leaders, such as Representatives Nathaniel Macon of 
                        North Carolina
                     and John Taylor of 
                        South Carolina
                    , were still wedded to commercial retaliation. Would-be War Hawks, moreover, exerted no
                    leadership. Representatives Peter B. Porter of 
                        New York
                     and Ezekiel Bacon of 
                        Massachusetts
                     were absent or not voting on key issues. Representatives Richard M. Johnson of 
                        Kentucky
                     and George M. Troup of 
                        Georgia
                     whimsically voted often with John Randolph and the Quids. The growing national
                    frustration needed leadership to crystallize it into a declaration of war—this was the
                    function of the War Hawks in the Twelfth Congress.
            Even in the Twelfth Congress the War Hawks had a continuous job of persuasion and conversion. If, as 
                        Brown
                     insists, the consensus in favor of war was formed as early as November, 1811, when the
                    Twelfth Congress opened, it took an inordinately long time to get around to declaring war. Since the
                    Federalists provided only an ineffective and vacillating opposition, it is apparent that the long
                    delay resulted from the necessity to convert reluctant Republicans—a process that
                    continued down to the very eve of the war declaration.
            With 
                        Brown
                    's conclusions I have no serious dispute—except to suggest that the
                    evolutionary process began earlier than the summer of 1811, and continued into the spring of 1812
                    before the "great majority" (to use 
                        Brown
                    's phrase) of Republicans wholeheartedly supported war. 
                        Brown
                    , after all, does not really abolish the War Hawks. He admits the importance of
                    leadership, and the term is usually applied only to the leaders of the Twelfth Congress. He merely
                    suggests that they were not as lighthearted as perhaps some historians have supposed.
         
         
         
            Minutes of the Board of Trustees for 
                        Vincennes
                     University (February 5, 1843—July 3, 1849)
            
                    Edited by Robert Constantine
                    ∗
                
            In the four installments of the minutes of the 
                        Vincennes
                     University board of trustees that have been published in the Indiana
                        Magazine of History,1 the most persistent theme is that of financial
                    distress and crisis. In its efforts to deal with this constant problem—a universal one in
                    the history of antebellum education, especially in the West—the board raised funds by
                    selling and leasing land, by conducting an ill-fated lottery, by circulating school subscription
                    lists, by accepting "in kind" tuition fees, by collecting certain penal funds from 
                        Knox
                     County sheriffs and justices of the peace, and, in 1839, by selling its seminary
                    building to the Catholic diocese of 
                        Vincennes
                    . These measures enabled the university to sponsor a variety of elementary- and
                    academy-level schools for three decades following the completion of its first building in 1811, but
                    they did not save it from extended periods of suspended operation nor did they ever make possible
                    the establishment of a complete college program.
            In the following installment, which covers the period from 1843 to 1849 and concludes this series,
                    the board was successful in developing a source of financial aid which proved to be of decisive
                    importance in the ultimate survival of 
                        Vincennes
                     University. At a meeting in June, 1843, the board adopted a resolution to
                    "enforce the right of 
                        Vincennes
                     University to the land in 
                        Gibson county
                    ."2 The decision to reassert the university's
                    claim to land granted to it in 1806 by the territorial legislature but subsequently transferred by
                    the Indiana General Assembly in 1822 to the Indiana State Seminary at 
                        Bloomington

                     that lasted for more than a decade. In the process, the
                    university was involved in litigation ranging from eviction suits in the 
                        Gibson County
                     circuit court to a suit against the state of Indiana in the Indiana Supreme Court and a
                    successful appeal to the Supreme Court of the 
                        United States
                    . Meanwhile the board had called upon the legal services of Chancellor James 
                        Kent
                     of 
                        New York
                     and the success of its "day in court" against the state of Indiana
                    owed much to that eminent jurist's opinion. The university realized approximately
                    $40,000 from its suit against the state. These funds, combined with the proceeds from the
                    sale of its original properties, provided the means for beginning in the decade before the Civil War
                    a continuous educational program housed in the university's own buildings.
            During the period from 1840 to 1852, when the board was developing and pressing its claims against
                    the state for the "unconstitutional arrest and detention of their property" in 
                        Gibson County
                    , the 
                        Vincennes
                     University Grammar School and the Preparatory Department were conducted in rented
                    rooms. In 1846 the principal of the Preparatory Department reported there were 81 male students and
                    31 female students in attendance and remarked that although the school was called
                    "Preparatory," instruction was given in "any branch necessary to a full
                    collegiate course."3 In 1852 the university erected a two-story brick
                    building for the 
                        Vincennes
                     University Male Seminary and, in 1855, a frame building for the 
                        Vincennes
                     University Female Classical Institute. By the mid-1850's the
                    university's legal identity was intact, its financial resources were more secure than they
                    had been for forty years, and its educational program was more stable than it had ever been. In all, 
                        Vincennes
                     University had passed through most of the ordeals which characterized education in the
                    ante-bellum period except the very common one of complete extinction.
            Later records indicate that the programs conducted in the two buildings constructed in the
                    1850's remained college-preparatory or secondary schools until the 1870's, when,
                    during the tenure of President Lewis Prugh, graduates of 
                        Vincennes
                     University Academic Department were admitted to the state university as sophomores. A
                    decade later the 
                        Vincennes
                     University catalogue for 1884-1885 stated that graduates of the Academic Department
                    could "enter the Junior Class of the State University without
                    examination…." 
                  
                     3 The principal's report is preserved in the archives of 
                                Vincennes
                             University. See also notes 27 and 31 on pp. 186 and 190.
               
                     Thus the functions of a junior college were being realized by
                    the university more than twenty years before the formal name of 
                        Vincennes
                     University Junior College was adopted in 1899.
            In the twentieth century the university again narrowly escaped corporate extinction in the
                    1920's, survived the financial crisis of the 1930's, and, in the period since
                    World War II, has made a truly remarkable recovery by all the indexes of educational growth and
                    prosperity—student body, quality of faculty, physical plant, and academic respectability.
                    Along the way the survival of the school has owed something to timely financial assistance from the
                    state of Indiana and from 
                        Knox
                     County, but it has owed at least as much to the notion that there "ought to
                    be" a 
                        Vincennes
                     University—a notion held by men like William Henry Harrison a century and a
                    half ago and Curtis G. Shake and Isaac K. Beckes in the present generation.
            February 5th 1843.1
            
            This being a Special meeting of Board called by order of the President. When there were present:
                    Samuel Hill, President, Messrs. Law, Robinson, Hitt, 
                        Wise
                    , Alexander, Harper, Burtch, Carnan, Ellis, Trustees.2
            
            
               
                  1 In editing these minutes original spelling has been faithfully-followed
                        and, with some exceptions, original punctuation has been retained. Periods have been added after
                        abbreviations and initials of persons; they have also been used at the ends of paragraphs.
                        Decimal points have been added. Commas have been inserted only to separate series of words and
                        phrases. The abbreviations "A.M." and "A.D." have been
                        standardized by uniform use of capital letters and periods. A colon has been used consistently
                        following "viz." and "to wit" and before each list of board
                        members present at a meeting, and a colon has been added occasionally where its use was clearly
                        indicated. Quotations and parentheses have not been closed if they were unclosed in the
                        original. Superior letters have been brought down to the line; unintentional repetitions have
                        been omitted. Space limitations have prompted the listing of members present and the recording
                        of votes in series instead of the columns which often appear in the original. Inconsistent or
                        unusual spacing used in the original minutes has dictated some modification of spacing and
                        paragraphing for the sake of clarity and uniformity; the locations of headings and signatures
                        have also been standardized. Topic headings and other notations which appear at times in the
                        margins of the minute book have not been included in this reproduction.

                        meeting were identified in Robert Constantine (ed.), Indiana Magazine of

            On motion Martin Robinson was appointed Secretary pro tem.
            Mr. Law on leave granted introduced the following Resolution:
            Whereas the Board of Trustees of "
                        Vincennes
                     University" have seen the publication of an act of the general assembly of the
                    State of Indiana at their last Session entitled "an act authorizing the Board doing county
                    business of the county of 
                        Knox
                     to adjust all claims with and against the Trustees of the late Nominal
                    
                        Vincennes
                     University in relation to the Sale of the Building and lots set apart for a county
                    Seminary by Law.3
            
            and Whereas the Board believes Said act to be unconstitutional, illegal, and Void, conferring powers
                    on an other Tribunial solely belonging to this, giving jurisdiction where non[e] can exist, untrue
                    in its preamble and unjust throughout.
            Therefore Resolved, That this Board hereby unanimously protest against said act for the reasons above
                    specified, and many others that might be adduced, and that should any action be taken in the
                    premises by the Board doing County business under said act, that the President of the Board employ
                    Counsel to defend the rights of the Board secured to them under the charter, of which they have
                    never been as yet divested.
            Resolved further that the President deliver to the Commissioners of 
                        Knox
                     County when called upon a copy of this Resolution.
            The said Resolution having been read and the Ayes and Nayes being called for said resolution was
                    unanimously adopted.
            The resignation of Joseph Somes4 as a member of this Board was introduced and on
                    motion the same was laid on the Table.
            The Board did then adjourn.

                  3 This act, approved on January 28, 1843, attempted to compel the
                        "trustees of the late nominal 
                            Vincennes
                         University" to turn over "all moneys … in their
                        hands" to the 
                            Knox
                         County commissioners, who were directed to use such funds for a "county
                        seminary" and for "congressional district schools." The act
                        authorized the county commissioners to sue in 
                            Knox
                         circuit court to recover the funds if the members of the university board of
                        trustees did not voluntarily relinquish them. Indiana, Laws (1842-1843), 159-60.

                    Satisfactorily performed by Mr. Judah for which the Committee allowed him $100, and for
                    which the Committee gave an order upon the Treasurer.
            Your Committee further report that they transmitted the Statement so procured from Mr. Judah to

            I have read and considered the above Documents and the Statement of Facts to which they are to be
                    applied, and I shall answer the general questions put to me upon the above case in the order in
                    which they have been stated.
            1st Question. The effect of the reservation in the act of Congress of 1804?
            This and the Two Succeeding Questions relate to the rights of the University.
            The Land in question, and which I understand to be the Gibson Township, belonged to the 
                        United States
                    , to which the Indian Title had been extinguished, when the act of Congress of 26th of
                    March 1804 was passed. That act contained a direction that "an entire Township, in the

                     District," be "located by the Secretary of
                    the Treasury for the use of a Seminary of Learning." This was a voluntary appropriation of
                    such a Township, or the creation of a Trust charged upon those lands for that use, and the Secretary
                    of the Treasury in Obedience to the law, located the Gibson Township in October
                    1806. The national faith was pledged by such an appropriation for such a purpose. It was consumated
                    by the official act of the officer of the government, and was valid and binding as the most formal
                    grant, being made by Statute it required no authentication by patent, a legislative grant is the
                    highest evidence of the Will of the Sovereign power and confers an absolute Title.
            This legislative grant of the Gibson Township has received frequent and the most undoubted
                    attestations both by Congress and the Legislature of Indiana.
            The act of the Legislature of the Territory of Indiana of the 17th of September 1807, Incorporating
                    the 
                        Vincennes
                     University was a recognition of this Title in the most explicit and emphatic manner, It
                    declared by way of recital that Congress had appropriated a Township of 23,040 acres of Land for the
                    use of the University or a public School in the District of 
                        Vincennes
                    , and that the Township had been Located and the boundaries designated, It authorised
                    the University so Incorporated to sell and convey 4000 acres of the above Township of Land, for the
                    purpose of putting into immediate operation the University, and it authorised the Corporation to
                    lease or rent the remaining part of the Township for the use of the University, For greater
                    Satisfaction to purchasers and perhaps to dissipate Scruples, the act of Congress of April 27th
                    1816, ch. 118, confirmed in fee the Title of purchasers of Land in the Township from the Board of
                    Trustees of the University, When the Territory of Indiana was admitted into the Union as a State
                    under the act of Congress of April 19th 1816 and formed the State Constitution in June of that year,
                    It was declared that "all rights, contracts and claims, both as it respected Individuals
                    and Corporations, should continue as if no change had taken place in the government; and that it
                    should be the duty of the general assembly to provide by law for the Improvement of such Lands actual as might thereafter be granted by the 
                        United States
                     to the State for the use of schools, and apply any funds which might
                    be raised from such Lands to accomplishment of the grand object for which they were
                    intended."
            There is no doubt that such rights, contracts, and duties as are alluded to in the
                    Constitution would upon general  principles of public Law and
                    morality have existed and been of binding obligation without that provision, But the declaration
                    serves to give a monitory and impressive Lesson of the sacred and indefeasible nature of such rights
                    and duties.
            Congress likewise by the act for admitting Indiana into the Union, shewed a still further and most
                    earnest solicitude for the endowment of Institutions of Learning, for they declared that one entire
                    Township, to be designated by the President, in addition to the one heretofore reserved
                        for that purpose, should be reserved for the use of seminaries of Learning, and vested in
                    the Legislature, solely for that purpose; This act may be Justly considered a
                    recognition of the reservation and appropriation by the act of March 1804 of the entire Township,
                    located by the Secretary of the Treasury in obedience to that Law as the Gibson Township, It is a
                    direct affirmance of the title, previously granted to the University, It had no other meaning or
                    application than to that Township.
            Here then is a title to the Gibson Township complete and perfect, under the repeated and Solemn
                    Sanction of the Governments both of the 
                        United States
                     and of Indiana, There has been no question, as I think may be assumed from the case, as
                    to the validity of the Title of the University to the Township down to the year 1820. The subsequent
                    pretext for Legislative invasions of the rights of the University to the Lands in question, is not
                    put upon any original defect of title, but upon the assumed forfeiture or loss of that title by the
                    default of the University, and which pretexts will here after be considered.
            2 question. The Interest of the corporation by virtue of their power to lease indefinitely?
            The Charter of Incorporation of the 
                        Vincennes
                     University designated that institution as the object or receptacle of the congressional
                    donation for charitable or literary uses of the Gibson Township. It located and vested the charity
                    in that institution, If there was any vagueness or uncertainty in the specific object or subject of
                    that grant, this Legislative Charter removed it. There cannot be any doubt of the legal right and
                    Seizen of that Donation of 1804, vesting in the University by means of the Charter, and it is a well
                    Settled principle in our jurisprudence, that a Subsequent act of Incorporation of a literary or
                    other charitable Institution, for the purpose among other things of an endowed capacity to receive a
                    prior grant of property for charitable uses, acts 
                    retrospectively and gives certainty, location, and a valid operation to the application of the
                    grant, ([John] Inglis vs [Trustees of the] Sailors' Snug Harbor 3 peters U. S. Rep., 99.

                        Ohio
                     Rep. 203.
            The charter of Incorporation of the 
                        Vincennes
                     University vested that institution with the usual powers of a Corporation in
                    perpetuity, to sue and be sued and to purchase, hold, lease and convey real and personal estate, and
                    it Secondly [?] authorized the Trustees or a majority of them to sell and convey to the amount of
                    4,000 acres of the Township and to lease the residue for the use of the University. That grant
                    implies and assumes an absolute right of disposition of the university Lands under the limitations
                    specially declared, I suppose the better construction to be that the general Power to convey was
                    limited by the subsequent provision conferring the power to sell to the amount only of 4,000 acres
                    and the power to lease the remainder. There are no prescribed limits given to the power to lease, It
                    is a power at large and it was competent for the Trustees of the University to lease for any term of
                    time however long, and upon any reasonable rent and upon any other usual conditions Known to the
                    Law, Without those restrictions, the power to sell and the power to lease would have been equally
                    unlimited and governed only by a sound and honest discretion.
            3 question. What right vested in the Legislature by Virtue of the 4th proposition in the 6th section
                    of the act of Congress for the admission of Indiana into the Union?
            I am of opinion that the proposition did not apply to the Gibson Township, previously appropriated
                    and given by the act of Congress of 1804. It related exclusively to another or new Township and was
                    appropriated for the use of a Seminary of Learning in addition to the one
                    "heretofore," as the act expressed it reserved for that purpose.
            4 Question. Under the Charter would removal from the State, or failure to attend the meetings of the
                    Board of itself without any action on the part of the Board, vacate the seats of
                    the members so removing or failing to attend?
            This and the two following relate to the effect of a loss of Trustees.
            
            I am clearly of opinion, that such a removal or default would not of itself produce that effect.
            A private eleemosynary Corporation such as the one before us, contains by its Charter a Contract between the  Government & the
                    Corporation, and the Legislature has not the lawfull power under the Constitution of the 
                        United States
                     to repeal, impair, alter, or vacate any of the rights and privileges conferred by the
                    Charter, against the consent of the Corporation expressly given or without the default of the
                    Corporation judicially ascertained and declared.
            This principle was avowed and settled in the Dartmouth College Case14 which has ever since been regarded as a kind of Magna Charta in
                    favour of Corporate rights, and which cannot be questioned or shaken without disturbing the
                    foundations of the Constitution of the 
                        United States
                    , grants of property and of franchises coupled with an Interest are beyond Legislative
                    control, unless that control be expressly reserved, in the Charter or grant, misuser or nonuser of
                    corporate franchises which are private or charitable and not of a civil and municipal character,
                    will not work a forfeiture, untill the corporation has been duly brought to answer and the default
                    and the forfeiture be adjudged by a court of Justice, Perhaps the rule may not be so strict, when
                    the integral part of a corporation is gone, without whose existance the functions of the corporation
                    cannot be excercised, and when there are no means left of supplying the integral part, and it
                    becomes incapable of acting and has no vitality left.
            That would be a singular case, but it has no application to the one we are considering. Here are a
                    number of Trustees remaining and competent under the qualifications in the charter; and as late as
                    1838 when the legislature of Indiana interfered by a special provision enabling the remaining
                    Trustees to supply vacancies, a majority of the former Trustees were still living, though not as
                    residents of the State, and their seats had not been declared vacant. The Charter provides for the
                    supply of vacancies in the Board of Trustees, arising either from resignation, removal, death, or
                    wilfull absence, and it is provided that "extraordinary meetings" of the Board
                    might be had by the President or any three of the Trustees on Ten days notice and at which such
                    vacancies might have been supplied.
            
               
                  14 One of John Marshall's most famous Supreme Court opinions
                        concerned the Dartmouth College case in 1819, which involved an attempt on the part of the state
                        legislature of 
                            New Hampshire
                         to alter the charter of Dartmouth College. The Court stated that the attempted
                        alteration violated the contract clause of the federal Constitution. There were similarities
                        between the action of the 
                            New Hampshire
                         legislature and the measures dealing with 
                            Vincennes
                         University passed by the Indiana General Assembly. See Constantine, Indiana Magazine of History, LVII (December, 1961), 360-67.
            
            
            5 & 6 questions. What would be the effect of an actual reduction of the Trustees to a number
                    less than a majority? and could less than a majority supply vacancies at a Charter meeting?
            The charter in this case declared that vacancies in the Board of Trustees should be supplied, by the
                    Board itself at their stated meeting, and that the whole number which Originally
                    consisted of 23 and after a regular course of reduction according to the charter, should not be less
                    than fifteen, and every vacancy there after, should be supplied at the stated meeting. I should
                    think that an integral part of the corporation, in respect to this Power of electing Trustees was
                    definite, and that a majority of this integral part must be present When vacancies were to be
                    supplied, and the powers of the corporation were accordingly suspended from this
                    action for the want of this majority of the Board, It is true that the charter provides that extraordinary meetings of the Board may be had, by the president or any three of
                    the Trustees, but this means only that meetings other than the ordinary stated semi annual meetings
                    may be called by the President or three Trustees, and I conclude from a review of the adjudged cases
                    on the subject, that less than a majority of the fifteen qualified Trustees after the reduction, or
                    less than a majority of original Twenty three Trustees before any regular reduction, were
                    incompetent to supply vacancies. I do not consider that the corporation was thereby disolved Its
                    franchises were suspended, and it was capable of reanimation and its vitality
                    restored to action by the Legislature without any new charter, and this was done by the act of the
                    Legislature of February 1838 The new Board of Trustees under this act possessed all the powers which
                    belonged to their predecessors, and all the rights and privileges which belonged to the corporation
                    prior to the act remained unimpaired, The proviso to the act left the rights of the University and
                    its title to the Gibson Township just where it found them, and though the university might have been
                    subjected to a judicial process of forfeiture for its default in loosing the competency of the Board
                    of Trustees, it would be absurd to suppose that the act intended that the corporation should still
                    be liable to such a judicial process of forfeiture, for a cause which the legislature had itself
                    removed, all pretence of forfeiture on that ground I consider to have been effectually taken away
                    The office of a proviso is only to qualify and restrain the generality of the enacting clause  and to exclude all ground of misinterpretation of its extent,
                    The act of 1838 assumes that the incorporation of the University was still a valid subsisting
                    Corporation, not withstanding that its franchises might be suspended from the want of a competent
                    Board of Trustees. It would indeed have been a violent and disastrous consequence, to have fixed an
                    absolute dissolution of the Corporation with all its ruinous result, without a trial, or hearing, or
                    judgment, The regular course for such an Inattention or negligence in leaving the Board of Trustees
                    in a minority.
            The act of 1838 is to be considered as putting an end to every pretext of forfeiture from the want of
                    a requisite quorum of the Board of Trustees and as removing all difficulty as to the capacity of the
                    remaining Trustees by restoring the Board to its original competency and vigor.
            7th Question. What is the effect of the proviso in the act of 1838, and could the
                    Legislature impair or destroy the rights under the Charter?
            These questions have been anticipated and answered under the heads of the three last questions.
            8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th questions. These all relate to the remedy assuming that
                    the original chartered rights of the corporation remain unimpaired and unaffected by Legislative
                    Interference?
            The rights of the corporation to bring suits by ejectment or writs of Disseisen, to recover
                    possession of Lands in the Gibson Township, against Intruders holding adversely under legislative
                    sales is unquestionable. The University has an equal right to lease the land, unsold by them, and
                    unoccupied by adverse Intruders, the real difficulty lies in the duration of
                    adverse Possession, held under adverse Titles derived from sales ordered by the State.
            It is stated that in 1820 and 1822 a portion of the lands were held under leases from the Corporation
                    In that case adverse possession had not then commenced, and the statute of limitations had not begun
                    to run, It is further stated that all the lands are now held by purchasers under the State, and the
                    grave question of fact then occurs has 20 years already run in favour of the adverse claimants, so
                    as to bar an ejectment or the Writ of Disseisen, and ripen the adverse claims and occupancy into a
                    right of possession? as to this fact I am not sufficiently informed, By the joint ressolution of the
                    legislature of Indiana of January 22nd 1820 (nearly 24 years ago) a superintendant was appointed of
                    the lands  claimed by the University, with directions to collect
                    the rents accruing on leases granted by the University, If submitted to by the Tenants, it was an
                    ouster of the right full possession of the University, On the 22nd day of January 1822 (nearly 22
                    years ago) the legislature followed up this violent intrusion, by the statute authorising
                    commissioners to execute deeds on behalf of the state for lands sold by the University, Under the
                    Joint resolution above named, it seems that the state authorities took the control of the Lands and
                    received the profits and sold all that could be sold and received payments into the State Treasury,
                    The assumption of right and of adverse Possession by the exercise of ownership over the Land under
                    the Joint resolution of 1820, and as purchasers and Lessees have been in possession claiming right
                    and title under the state such possession continuing for 20 years would be a bar to actions now to
                    be commenced by the corporation, The act of the Legislature in 1838 reorganizing the Board of
                    Trustees I do not consider, as a waiver of their right and Title set up against the lands and
                    conveyed by their authority to purchasers under them, for the proviso to the act
                    saves and reserves the existing claims of right, (whatever they may have been) to the lands in the
                    Gibson Township, and forbids the construction that the act confers any right or power to the
                    Trustees over that Township, or to the funds which had or might there after accrue from sales of the
                    Lands therein. Here the proviso has significancy and efficacy. The act of 1838 would seem to have
                    intended to resusicate the University, but stripped of all its valuable powers and means to promote
                    the cause of Learning.
            I do not see how any form of action will help the case, if the adverse possessions have existed for
                    20 years, a much shorter period of Limitation would bar the action for use and occupation or the
                    action of account, If there was no such adverse possession barring the right, I should think that
                    the corporate Title would bear down and destroy the operation of all legislative Ressolutions and
                    statutory enactments, The provision in the Constitution of the 
                        United States
                     that "no State can pass laws impairing the obligation of contracts,"
                    would be a Bulwark of protection, If it were not for the unacountable negligence of the Trustees of
                    the University, sleeping the sleep of death on its rights.
            The University states in its forcible and affecting petition to the Legislature, that they did not
                    wish to disturb the Titles of the numerous Body of Purchasers of their valuable lands and would be
                    willing to receive the proceeds of the sales made  by the State,
                    and confirm the sale, Nothing can be more reasonable and just than this offer, & unless
                    there be some equitable considerations which do not appear for this invasion of corporate rights,
                    and charity funds and property, I am of opinion that the legislature of Indiana is bound by the most
                    imperious obligations of Justice and honor to indemnify the University for this unconstitutional
                    arrest and detention of their property.

            The Board met persuant to adjournment, present: Messr. Burtch, Bishop, 
                        Wise
                    , Ellis, Harper, Carnan, Johnson, Martin, & Judah.
            Mr. Carnan was appointed chairman.
            Mr. Ellis from the committee appointed in relation to the Gibson Co. Law suits made a report, and
                    submitted certain resolutions as follows:
            Whereas in the opinion of the Board of Trustees for the 
                        Vincennes
                     University, their claim to the Gibson Seminary Township is clear and indisputable, but
                    that it is equally clear and indisputable that the holders of these lands have a just claim on the
                    State for a full indemnity.
            And whereas, the Board of Trustees in view of the just responsibility of the State and of the
                    equitable claims of the Holders, are willing that the State shall defend the suits brought by the
                    Board of Trustees to try the title to the Said Lands, in place of the Holders; and also are willing
                    to accept from the state a just remuneration for the value of the said Lands in the place of the
                    Lands themselves.
            Therefore resolved, That the Senator and Representative from 
                        Knox
                     County23 be requested to procure the enactment 
                  
                     23 The representative from 
                                Knox
                             County at the time was Robert N. Carnan; the senator was Abner T. Ellis.

                    the shortest time and at the least expense in such manner as will afford satisfaction to all
                    parties; and also if possible to procure such an arrangement by the state as in case the Trustees
                    succeed in their claim, will relieve the Holders, and yet compensate and satisfy the Trustees.
            And Resolved, That Mr. Ellis be requested to communicate this Resolution to Saml. Hall24 Esq. to be submitted to his clients.

                    , Ellis, Harper, Carnan, Johnson, & Martin, & [one name illegible].
            On motion A. T. Ellis was appointed Secy, pro tem.
            And on motion the following resolution was unanimously adopted:
            Be it resolved by the Trustees for the 
                        Vincennes
                     University—that the act of the late General Assembly of the State of
                    Indiana—Entitled—an act to authorise the Trustees for the 
                        Vincennes
                     University to bring suit against the State of Indiana, and for other purposes approved
                    Jany. 17. 1846. be and the provisions thereof are hereby adopted and accepted by the Board of
                    Trustees for the 
                        Vincennes
                     University.
            
               
                  24 Samuel Hall was a leading attorney and "counsel of the Holders
                        of the Lands" in 
                            Gibson County
                        . He served as circuit court judge of that county from 1832 to 1835, was a member of
                        the Indiana General Assembly from 
                            Gibson County
                         (1829, 1830, 1845), was elected lieutenant governor of Indiana in 1840, and was a
                        delegate to the Indiana constitutional convention in 1850-1851. Stormont, History

            Resolved further that the counsel employed for the prosecution of the claims of the University upon
                    the Gibson Seminary township of Land do as soon as practicable prepare and file in the 
                        Marion

                    provisions of said act.25
            
            Resolved further that said Counsel also cause to be dismissed the Suits now pending in the Gibson
                    circuit court in favour of the University & make the best arrangement they can in relation
                    to the costs that have occured in the same.

                  25 Indiana, Local Laws (1845-1846), 233-34. This act,
                        which authorized the trustees of the university to sue the state of Indiana, stated that such a
                        suit against the state was preferable to "a great number of suits against the
                        individual owners of said land, who purchased the same in good faith from the State, not
                        doubting but that their titles were good…." If the court found in favor of
                        the trustees of 
                            Vincennes
                         University, the state of Indiana would be responsible for compensating the
                        university for the township of land. In December, 1847, the 
                            Marion
                         circuit court awarded the trustees of 
                            Vincennes
                         University "30,099 dollars and 96 cents, being the proceeds of a portion
                        of the lands in said township … which were paid into the state treasury for the use
                        of the Indiana University." This decision was reversed by the Indiana Supreme Court in
                        its November term in 1850. State v. Trustees of 
                                Vincennes
                             University, 2 Indiana Reports 293 (1850). Two years later the case was
                        heard by the 
                            United States
                         Supreme Court, which cited the Dartmouth College case, overruled the Indiana
                        Supreme Court, and confirmed the decision of the 
                            Marion
                         circuit court. Trustees for 
                                Vincennes
                             University v. State of Indiana, 14 Howard 268 (1852). In
                        a report to the university's board of trustees which is recorded in the minutes of July
                        20, 1855, the board's counsel, Samuel Judah, noted that the "Amt. of recovery
                        is $66,585. and 2200 Acres or thereabouts of land," but that his fees and
                        expenses would reduce to slightly under $40,000 the amount of money the board might
                        realize. Litigation over these expenses continued into the 1860's before it was finally
                        resolved. Judah v. Trustees of 
                                Vincennes
                             University, 16 Indiana Reports 56 (1861). The precedent of state
                        obligation to the university established in the litigation of 1847-1852 led to subsequent
                        payments by the state of $15,000 in 1895, $120,000 in 1911, and the annual
                        appropriations now derived from state funds.
               
                  26 Two pages following the minutes of the February 25 meeting were left
                        blank, presumably in order to transcribe the act of the General Assembly discussed at this
                        meeting. No explanation has been found for listing both Ellis and Judah as secretary at this
                        meeting or for occasional similar duplications in the minutes of other meetings.
            
            
            July 27. 1846
            The Board met persuant to adjournment—present: Messr. Alexander, prst., Ellis, Bishop,
                    Decker, Johnson, Martin, 
                        Wise
                    , Somes, and Judah, Secy., and Burtch.
            Mr. Alexander submitted a report from his committee on the preparatory school and a communication
                    from the Teacher Mr. Jocelyn—which was read.27
            
            On motion of Mr. Alexander seconded by Mr. Judah, it was resolved—that the sum of
                    $100. be appropriated for the rent of the School House for the ensuing
                    year—and that the further sum of $50. be appropriated to assist in the payment
                    of an assistant teacher—and that said sums be paid by the Treasurer, on the orders of the
                    present committee who are assumed to continue their services.
            On motion, ordered that the acct. of the officers of the Gibson Circuit Court for fees
                    $240.22 be allowed and that the treasurer be authorised to pay the balance due on the
                    same, first deducting the sum of $ heretofore payd the clerk.28
            
            ordered that suit be instituted against Mr. Eberwine unless he pay the interest on his debt, and that
                    execution be issued on the College decree unless the interest be paid.
            Mr. Burtch presented the acct. R. Y. Caddington for printing &c. $7.00 which was
                    not allowed.
            Ordered that the Board adjourn until 5th day of January next.
            Saml. Judah Secy.
            
               
                  27 The communication from Jocelyn is preserved in the archives of 
                            Vincennes
                         University. In it Jocelyn reported that 112 students had been enrolled in the
                        preparatory school during the past year, including 31 female students. In a rather long passage
                        Jocelyn set down his philosophy of education, and assured the board that he and the instructors
                        had "endeavored to expand the minds under their charge and instill into their hearts
                        correct moral principles," convinced as he was that "if the heart be not
                        educated, education would be a curse … and the children … moral
                        monstrosities." Among his suggestions for the board's consideration Jocelyn
                        recommended greater publicity for the institution as a means of attracting students from
                        "abroad … giving us greater character and standing," and
                        "letting the world know that at 
                            Vincennes
                         there is a Protestant Institution for the education of the young."
                        Further, he reminded the board that his assistant, who had been paid $175 during the
                        past year, could not be expected to stay for that amount, which would "scarcely pay his
                        immediate expenses." In a conclusion strikingly modern in its content and tone, Jocelyn
                        stated that "the people in this community cannot and need not expect that qualified
                        teachers will come here and wear away their lives for the sake of their children, and receive no
                        remuneration."
               
                  28 On October 7, 1844, the board had authorized a payment to the clerk of 
                            Gibson County
                         of $135.36 for the expenses of change of venue in six cases at
                        $22.56 for each case.

                        Wise
                    , Hitt, Smith, Johnson, & Somes.
            On motion Dr. Decker was appointed President pro tem, and Dr. Somes Secy, pro tem.
            On motion A. W. Tracy29 was elected a Trustee in the place of Mr. Alexander

                    declines to serve.
            Messr. Hitt & Johnson The Com. appd. and contd. to visit the preparitory dept. reported as
                    follows: That said com. rented the whole House of Judge Bishop, and that Mrs. Shaw30 continues to occupy about one third of said House, much to the detriment of said
                    institution; and the Com. ask the Board for instructions.
            And on motion: Resolved: That the Com. be and they are hereby directed to inform Mr. Bishop that they
                    shall retain one third of the Rent for the length of time the part occupied by Mrs. Shaw is so held
                    and kept from the Committees use for the present year.
            Ordered that the Board adjourn until next.

                    Harper appeared.
            Dr. Somes submitted the following resolution:
            Resolved, That the Treasurer forthwith invest $2000, part of the cash now on hand in the
                    stock of the

                     Branch of the State Bank of Indiana35 which was
                    seconded—when Mr. Ellis moved to amend the same by striking out the second clause; and

                    so the same was so amended.
            And thereupon Mr. Ellis moved to strike out $2000. and insert $3000. in the
                    first clause of said resolution, which being seconded the ayes & Noes were demanded a
                    division of the question was ordered—whereupon on the question of striking out the vote
                    was Ayes. Somes, 
                        Wise

                            Wabash
                         Navigation Company was chartered by the Indiana General Assembly on January 13,
                        1846, for "the improvement of that part of the 
                            Wabash
                         River which is subject to the concurrent jurisdiction of 
                            Illinois
                         and Indiana." Several of the men who were, or had been, on the
                        university's board of trustees were named commissioners of the company, including
                        Samuel Judah, William Burtch, John Wise, John Ross, and David S. Bonner.

                        Western Sun, March 6, 1847. The minutes of the board of trustees indicate that
                        at least during the next two decades representatives of the university board attended meetings
                        of the stockholders of the 
                            Wabash
                         Navigation Company. No information has been found regarding the final outcome of
                        this investment.
               
                  35 The State Bank of Indiana was chartered by the legislature in its
                        1833-1834 session and "books for receiving subscriptions to [the 
                            Vincennes
                         branch] were opened on April 6, 1834." Many of the men who served on the
                        university's board were officers and/or shareholders in the 
                            Vincennes
                         branch of the bank, including John Law, a director; D. S. Bonner, president; and
                        John Ross, cashier. 
                            Vincennes

                        27, 1845. During the depression which followed the Panic of 1837 the bank was bitterly opposed
                        in the Indiana General Assembly by a faction led by Samuel Judah, but it survived both the panic
                        and the anti-bank sentiment of the state legislators, and before its 25-year charter expired in
                        1859 it had acquired a reputation of being better than any other bank in the west at protecting
                        itself and taking care of its customers. Logan Esarey, State Banking in Indiana,

            And on the question, shall the resolution as amended be adopted? the ayes and noes were called and
                    the vote was as follows:—Ayes. Somes, Carnan, Robinson, Ellis, Bishop, Burtch, Johnson,
                    Judah, Hitt, Pres. Noes 
                        Wise
                    , Martin, Harper And so the resolution as amended was adopted.

                            Greek. A total of 92 "scholars" had paid a total of $375.04 in
                            tuition to Jocelyn, who was pleased with their academic progress, except for a few who were
                            "petted and caressed at home— permitted to do as they please and [paid]
                            little or no attention to the request of their teacher." Among other
                            recommendations, Jocelyn suggested that the board establish a "living
                            salary" for the teacher and do away with the system under which his salary was
                            derived from tuition fees. The additional statement requested of Jocelyn by the board at
                            this meeting, though apparently presented by one of the trustees at the board meeting on

                    statehood, as well as one of an enduring and devoted friendship. All the letters published in this
                    volume are in the Gallatin Papers in the New-York Historical Society, the letters from Gallatin to
                    Badollet having been returned to Gallatin in 1846 by a member of Badollet's family.
            Badollet and Gallatin were both born in 
                  Geneva,
                            Switzerland
               , of well-known families, and both were
                    college trained. Attracted by the free atmosphere of America they determined to emigrate. Gallatin
                    came in 1780. After traveling for several years he settled in western Pennsylvania in 1785 and urged
                    Badollet to join him. The latter arrived by 1786. In 1795 the two, with three other men, purchased
                    650 acres and laid out the town of New 
                        Geneva
                    , with a view to attracting a Swiss colony. In 1799 the partnership broke up; Badollet
                    returned to his Pennsylvania farm and Gallatin, who had begun a career of public service, spent most
                    of his time in 
                  New York, Philadelphia
               , and Washington. Badollet found it difficult to
                    maintain his family although he had a position of modest importance in the region. Gallatin, who had
                    become secretary of the treasury under Jefferson, obtained for Badollet the position of register of
                    the newly created land office at 
                        Vincennes
                    . He highly recommended Badollet as being of strict integrity, and having an excellent
                    command of English. "This is the only instance of favoritism discovered during
                    Gallatin's long service in the Treasury Department" (p. 14) and was to be amply
                    justified by Badollet's faithful service. The correspondence begins in April, 1804, with
                    Gallatin's notification to Badollet of his appointment. Badollet took the oath of office in 
                        Vincennes
                     on September 19.
            Badollet was full of misgivings as to his ability to cope with the duties of the office and poured
                    out to Gallatin his problems and fears. Gallatin was too occupied with affairs of state to answer as
                    fully, but he wrote encouragement and never lost confidence in his friend. Soon Badollet assumed a
                    place among the more important citizens of 
                        Vincennes
                    , being a member of the first board of trustees of 
                        Vincennes
                     University, first president of the 
                        Vincennes
                     Library Company, and later president of the Historical and Antiquarian Society.
            Badollet's letters indicate that he soon became disillusioned about the morals of Americans.
                    Of unswerving honesty himself, he was highly critical of the often devious methods of his
                    fellow-citizens to rise in  the world politically and
                    financially. At first an admirer, he soon became violently critical of William Henry Harrison and
                    other officials in 
                        Vincennes
                    . With his love of freedom, he could not reconcile himself to the machinations of the
                    slavery party to abrogate the provision of the Ordinance of 1787 against involuntary servitude. He
                    wrote that he did not approve Harrison's relations with the Indians; in fact nothing the
                    governor did was right. In a letter to Gallatin in 1809 Harrison speaks highly of
                    Badollet's integrity, but says that he is "extremely irritable & Pevish
                    & altho possessed of a sound understanding he is so extremely diffident of himself &
                    so little acquainted with the world that there is not a man on earth more easily duped" (p.
                    111). Previously Gallatin had written Badollet who had complained of persecution: "As to
                    your squables & disappointment, they are matters of course. At what time, or in what
                    country, did you ever hear that men assumed the priviledge of being more honest than the mass of the
                    society in which they lived, without being hated & persecuted? … When you are
                    tired of struggling with vice & selfishness, rest yourself, mind your own business, and
                    fight them only when they come directly in your way" (pp. 106-07). In spite of this good
                    advice from his devoted friend, Badollet continued to write his criticisms of local persons and
                    conditions. Gallatin, too, was critical of society, but being more a man of the world accepted it
                    more calmly.
            Along with others, Badollet believed that the Prophet was leading his group of Indians in the right
                    direction by encouraging habits of industry and sobriety, and that Harrison's enmity toward
                    Tecumseh and the Prophet was due to a wish to "stifle the murmurs of the 
                        Wabash
                     Indians in relation to the late treaties and the unwarrantable means employed to effect
                    them" (p. 195). He felt that the 
                        Tippecanoe
                     expedition was unnecessary, as most of the Indians were entirely peaceable and the
                    occasional outrages were the work of only one tribe, the Potawatomi. He considered Harrison a poor
                    military leader, not, however, questioning his personal bravery. He was apprehensive of being
                    falsely accused of communicating with the Indians. Inevitably he became involved in the squabbles
                    over the relative merits of the Regulars under Col. John P. Boyd and the militia, and felt that the
                    fact that he had subscribed to resolutions praising Boyd had put him in danger of physical violence.
                    For some time after the battle he was in a state of terror regarding possible Indian attacks and
                    criticized Harrison as having no plan for the defense of 
                        Vincennes
                    . But fear of the Indians simmered down, and Harrison left 
                        Vincennes
                     as commander-in-chief of the army.
            Badollet's letters then focused on removal of the capital from 
                        Vincennes
                     to Corydon and the attainment of statehood. Badollet was a member of the Constitutional
                    Convention and served on several committees. He introduced sections having to do with education,
                    care of the indigent, and establishment of libraries. In spite of their devoted friendship, Badollet
                    and Gallatin met only once after 1804 when, in 1825, Badollet journeyed to New 
                        Geneva
                     where Gallatin was then living. The correspondence ends with Badollet's last
                    letter to Gallatin, penned in October, 1836.
            
            It seems strange that Badollet did not mention John Cleves Symmes Harrison, son of the governor, who
                    became receiver of the 
                        Vincennes
                     land office in 1820 and continued in that position until 1830. Young Harrison was
                    popular and well thought of, and perhaps Badollet found nothing in his conduct to critieize. This
                    volume, ably edited by Gayle Thornbrough, is well introduced and annotated and fully indexed. It is
                    of great value to those interested in the early days of 
                        Vincennes
                     and Indiana.

            The biography of Charles Evans reads like a modern Horatio Alger story. It is the incredible
                    narrative of a lowly inmate of the 
                        Boston
                     Asylum and Farm School for Indigent Boys. As a nine year old, the orphaned Evans was
                    admitted to the distinguished charitable institution "that supplied the sense of direction
                    and training which would lead to opportunities for his life's work" (p. 3), that
                    of creating one of the greatest bibliographical works of all times. For, in spite of
                    "ghosts and omissions, errors and inaccuracies, complexity and inconsistency,"
                    this monumental work is often cited for praise as well as blame. From the titles in a volume for a
                    given year it is possible to obtain "a splendid picture of the cultural, intellectual,
                    political, and social conditions of that period of American history" (p. 320).
            
               
                        Indianapolis
                     librarians, scholars, and citizens should find this biography of special interest
                    because of Evans' connection with the public library of that capital city. In 1872, when
                    Evans was but twenty-two years of age, he became the first librarian of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Public Library. In a few years he had placed it among the leading American libraries.
                    Among his goals "was a collection of source materials for the study of Indiana
                    history" (p. 44). His determination to make the library the depository for all materials
                    relating to the city and state was demonstrated by his becoming a member of the Indiana Historical
                    Society where he hoped to exert sufficient influence for the support of this venture.
                    Evans' efforts to promote social, literary, and aesthetic culture, however, did not
                    materialize until January, 1877, at which time the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Literary Club was organized. The following year 
                        Indianapolis
                     failed to reappoint its first librarian. "As the board rejected Charles Evans
                    for personal and political spite, it turned its back on six years of almost phenomenal library
                    progress" (p. 76). After an interval of over ten years he was again selected librarian of
                    the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Public Library. This appointment, however, lasted for only about three years.
                    Fortunately, whenever Evans lost a post, his staunch supporter, William F. Poole, was usually
                    successful in placing him in some other library. Among the libraries that Evans served were the
                    Enoch Pratt Free Library, Omaha Public Library, Newberry Library, and the 
                        Virginia
                     Library of McCormick Theological Seminary. In 1896 he was appointed librarian of the 
                        Chicago
                     Historical Society.  Still Evans' evil
                    genius continued to pursue him, and seven years later the Society dismissed him. "Charles
                    Evans was capable of rare kindliness and geniality … but he never strove to apply these
                    charms to board members. This was a serious oversight and it made his career as a librarian a
                    failure" (p. 194).
            Evans was a charter member of the American Library Association, and he regarded it a real honor to
                    hold membership in the American Antiquarian Society. Through these organizations he met many
                    outstanding scholars, which proved to be a definite advantage when he was dismissed as librarian of
                    the 
                        Chicago
                     Historical Society. By that time, luckily, Evans had gained the recognition of several
                    influential friends who were able to obtain grants from the American Council of Learned Societies
                    which made it possible for him to devote the remainder of his life to the American
                        Bibliography.
            
            All the stress and strain of the past was forgotten by Evans on June 18, 1934, when 
                        Brown
                     University conferred upon him the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters. "

               The Quest for Power: The Lower Houses of Assembly in the Southern Royal Colonies,
                        1689-1776. By Jack P. Greene. (

            The thesis of this work—the emergence of the lower houses as the dominant element in
                    colonial government during the eighteenth century— is familiar to anyone who has ever
                    read a basic textbook in American history. Related to the major theme is the proposition that
                    British measures after 1763 threatened the power of the lower houses, and that the Declaration of
                    Independence was indeed an accurate, valid statement of grievances against King and Parliament. 
                        Greene
                    's book could have provided an excellent opportunity to test the thesis set
                    forth by Bernard Bailyn in an address delivered at 
                        Williamsburg
                     some years ago that appeals to the constitutional power of the lower houses were the
                    rationalizations of newly emerging economic and social elites against an entrenched local group
                    whose political authority stemmed from the imperial government. Aware of this thesis, 
                        Greene
                     thought originally to consider the economic and social position of colonial politicians
                    as it was related to the structure of political power, but found this too large a task for a single
                    volume. Consequently, he has designated his work an institutional and constitutional rather than a
                    political study. Unfortunately this type of history is artificial, for men, not institutions, make
                    history. In 
                        Greene
                    's treatment, a monolithic institution, seemingly with a mind—and
                    one mind at that—is the actor. But how can we explain those members of the lower houses
                    who were Loyalists, or the fact that so very often disputes were between factions within the lower house, one supporting and the other opposing the royal executive and
                    imperial government?
            
            But this is to criticize 
                        Greene
                     for not writing a different book. He is vulnerable, nonetheless, on the work he did
                    produce for his conclusions are at worst non sequiturs and at best none too
                    convincing. 
                        Greene
                     discusses in great detail sixteen powers won by the lower houses before 1763 to prove
                    that they had become the dominant element in colonial government and describes the relationship of
                    these powers to the measures adopted by the British government after the French war. Yet by 
                        Greene
                    's own admission British acts after 1763 did not interfere
                    with or threaten the power to frame money bills, audit accounts, disperse money, regulate fees, or
                    control the internal proceedings of the lower houses, the public works or public printers, or the
                    existing regulation of the militia. He further acknowledges that salaries for governors and
                    comparable matters did not become important issues. The disputes on appointment of agents, control
                    of Indian affairs, church patronage, and paper money were resolved before the Revolution on terms
                    favorable to the assemblies. 
                        Greene
                    's entire case rests on Parliamentary taxation and a few measures (many
                    abandoned before 1774) in particular colonies purportedly designed to tighten imperial control.
                    These last points in themselves, he argues, were insufficient to bring on the Revolution. In
                    attacking British policy 
                        Greene
                     emphasizes Parliamentary taxation as a threat to home rule and the power of the lower
                    houses and assumes that men always believe and act on the basis of what they publicly profess. But
                    is there no room for propaganda or self-delusion? 
                        Greene
                     does not demonstrate the immediacy, reality, or even the potentiality of the supposed
                    imperial threat. How and why did Whig leaders come to such an erroneous conclusion? British
                    officials would have allowed home rule under a formula recognizing the theory but not the exercise
                    of Parliamentary authority; they would not allow a challenge to governmental authority. Could any
                    responsible government do differently? Professor 
                        Greene
                     might have contributed to a better understanding of the unstated motives of the Whig
                    leaders and the development of the Revolution by considering the economic, social, and political
                    structure of power for which he felt he did not have time.

            Professor 
                        Brown
                    's book is the most recent account of the Regulator movement in 
                        South Carolina
                    . It is based on extensive research, and it brings together more facts about the
                    movement and its members than any other study. Together with the documents edited by Richard J.
                    Hooker in The Carolina Backcountry on the Eve of the Revolution: The Journal and other
                        Writings of Charles Woodmason, it provides all the information the general reader needs in
                    order to understand the movement.
            The 
                        South Carolina
                     Regulators, as distinguished from those of 
                        North Carolina
                    , are here portrayed as conservatives who were driven to take the law into their own
                    hands because there was no law. After a brief moment of excess, they were opposed by equally
                    conservative  men known as Moderators, men who for their own
                    reasons had refused to become Regulators. Both groups, once the writ of the King could reach into
                    the Back Country under the aegis of the Circuit Court Act of 1769, relinquished their organizations
                    and their extralegal activities. By 1771—certainly by 1774—the movement was
                    dead, its grievances satisfied or at least legally expressed through the grand juries'
                    presentments to the circuit courts.
            To substantiate this thesis, 
                        Brown
                     details the heightened social disorganization in the interior following the Cherokee
                    war of 1760-1761, which aggravated the long-standing grievances of the Back Country, and he points
                    to the decline of extralegal activity once law was established. He also analyzes the property
                    holdings and subsequent political and social positions of 120 Regulators (all he could identify out
                    of several thousands), finding them to be for the most part men of substance or young men on the
                    rise with positions to make and opportunities to protect.
            On the negative side, 
                        Brown
                     disposes of two closely related conventional interpretations of the 
                        South Carolina
                     movement. The threat posed by the Back Country to the Low Country, 
                        Brown
                     holds, was confined both in intent and practice to rhetoric. The major grievance was
                    not the lack of representation or the existence of discriminatory taxation, but the failure to
                    provide courts to protect family and property from the lawlessness of the frontier brigands and from
                    the shiftlessness and immorality of the "lower people." The absence of major
                    sectional conflict 
                        Brown
                     finds confirmed in the attitudes of the Regulators toward the American Revolution.
                    Instead of finding the few Regulators whose attitude he is able to identify as overwhelmingly
                    Loyalist in sympathy, he finds more of them to have been Patriots.
            In short, what 
                        Brown
                    's study does is to take away from the Regulator movement in 
                        South Carolina
                     its significance as a conflict between the established East and the frontier West and
                    its connection with the division in 
                        South Carolina
                     over the Revolution. In this sense, his findings are essentially negative and they
                    reduce the subject to local history. As a substitute, he sees in the extralegal measures taken to
                    preserve law and order an aspect of the American character which was later given the name of
                    vigilantism.
            "The opposing strands of obedience and revolution have been ultimately reconciled in the
                    over-all American character," concludes 
                        Brown
                    . "The vigilante movement is a striking example of the way in which [these]
                    ideals … may unite in the same institution. The great desire of the 
                        South Carolina
                     Regulators as vigilantes was for the establishment of law and order, but in the absence
                    of social stability and mature institutions they found it necessary to resort to illegal acts of
                    violence to clear the way for the normal function of law and order. Violence was a means to an end.
                    When it had served its purpose, it was discarded. The significance of the Regulators' use
                    of violence remains as a measure of the intense devotion which respectable men of property give to
                    the principles of law and order" (p. 142).
            
               
                        Brown
                     is probably right in his conclusions. At any rate, I do not have the facts at hand to
                    refute the extensive array he has compiled, and I doubt that they exist. But one may legitimately
                    ask if the facts  that can be ascertained by industrious (and in
                    this case, imaginative) dredging among the sources can really tell us what the significance of the
                    movement is. I shall use this book and the information presented in it to help me understand the
                    coming of the American Revolution as well as the nature of that Revolution. The failure of the
                    British to provide adequate local government, reasonable equality of taxation, proper
                    representation, educational and religious facilities, the protection of property, and a means of
                    resolving conflicts between groups within the colonies is represented in microcosm in 
                        South Carolina
                    . That these conditions, which existed for a decade, perhaps decades, just prior to the
                    Revolution, had no connection with the Revolution itself, can hardly be an acceptable conclusion,
                    implicit or explicit. In my opinion, 
                        Brown
                     has written a more important book than he realizes, and his second book should not be,
                    as he promises, a further study of the vigilante movement, but volume two in the coming of the
                    Revolution in

               Royal Raiders: The Tories of the American Revolution. By North Callahan. (

            The Tory view of the American Revolution and the actions which resulted from that view form the theme
                    of Royal Raiders. Professor Callahan thinks that Americans have long had a
                    one-sided conception of the war for independence, with the mistaken notion that the colonists rose
                    as one unified body to expel the enemy. Now they are realizing more and more, he feels, that the
                    struggle also pitted Americans against Americans.
            By Professor Callahan's definition, the Tories comprised those Americans who preferred the
                    security of the Empire to the uncertainty of a new government under inexperienced leaders. From this
                    kind of change they shrank, perhaps aware that they stood to lose a job, land, trade, a hoped-for
                    bishop, or their idolized king. Many Tories who had approved a little rioting as a means of bringing
                    the British government to terms later opposed the movement when propertyless mobs began to destroy
                    for the sheer joy of destruction and when those without political privilege cried loudest for
                    liberty. When war came, about 50,000 Tories helped the British armies with enthusiasm and vigor.
                    Their failure arose from a lack of unity, leadership, arms, and aggressiveness; furthermore, their
                    position was defensive and they had no positive program, for they were satisfied with a system which
                    had been successful for 150 years.
            Many familiar stories appear in the book, but there is also a definite effort to present the truth
                    about some Tory leaders whose reputations have been distorted by hatred and propaganda. One meets
                    Thomas Hutchinson, who loved his country and deplored some of the British policies; the Reverend
                    Jonathan Boucher, who preached with loaded pistols on the pulpit cushion; and the delightful
                    Congregationalist,  the Reverend Mather Byles of 
                        Boston
                    , who gravely marched guard, musket on shoulder, before his own door while his official
                    " 'observe-a-Tory'" ran an errand for him. One also meets
                    Americans—on both sides—who persecuted, tortured, and defiled graves.
            A topic such as this is difficult to organize, and at times the reader comes away with impressions of
                    a rambling, repetitive account; for instance, the same prominent families that were split by
                    opposing sympathies are named on pages 92 and 101. And in view of the fact that at least a dozen
                    books treat Loyalists and their problems, it is strange to read that "they have
                    … virtually lost their place in history" (p. 35).
            There are a few errors such as an incorrect reference to Lord George Germain, secretary of state for
                    American affairs. The index is very inadequate; for example, because the individual colonies or
                    states are not entered, it is impossible to draw together what Professor Callahan says about any one
                    of them.
            All in all, the book rounds up much information about the Tories and is especially valuable because
                    the author has used Tory materials. The evaluations are so fair and moderate that Professor Callahan
                    has certainly given a frequently maligned devil his due.

               Foreign Policies of the Founding Fathers. By Paul A. Varg. ([East Lansing]: 
                        Michigan
                     State University Press, 1963. Pp. xi, 316. Notes, index. $6.50.)
            In this volume Paul A. Varg surveys American foreign policy from the outbreak of the Revolution to
                    the declaration of war in 1812. Although monographs on aspects of the period abound and there are
                    several general surveys of only slightly smaller scope than Varg's, his volume is the first
                    to perform this precise task. For the general reader or beginning student, Foreign
                        Policies of the Founding Fathers will perhaps be useful as an introduction. Varg writes
                    clearly, tells an uncomplicated story, and generally apportions his space reasonably. He describes
                    such matters as 
                        Madison
                    's nationalism and Jefferson's dislike of Genet with an air of
                    discovery that makes his treatment seem fresh. Because his fairly numerous errors concern matters of
                    detail (Washington did not "deliver" the Farewell Address, the Tripolitanians did
                    not "arrest" the 
                  
                            Philadelphia
                        's crew, 
                        Madison
                    's pamphlet of 1806 does not carry the title Varg gives it), these errors will
                    irritate the scholar rather than seriously mislead the tyro.
            As original scholarship, Varg's book has little to offer. He presents few new
                    interpretations, although in analyzing the diplomatic implications of the Constitution he plows
                    ground too long fallow. Aside from the 
                        Madison
                     manuscripts, he has examined almost no non-printed sources. Given the scope of his
                    volume, this is perhaps not surprising. More upsetting is the absence of reference to the printed
                    works of many American statesmen and to numerous important historical studies, although the text
                    sometimes shows an awareness of material and interpretations 
                    pretations not specified in the footnotes. Still, for the period of the American Revolution alone,
                    the reader finds no reference to Gerald Stourzh, Felix Gilbert, C. Page Smith, Samuel Flagg Bemis,
                    Alfred L. Burt, or Vincent S. Harlow.
            Varg's basic theme is the interplay of ideals and reality, particularly economic reality.
                    The need for foreign assistance caused many reluctant Americans to favor independence in 1776, and
                    commercial considerations played a decisive part in the formation of a new government in 1789.
                    Thereafter, says Varg, there was a conflict between the realistic Hamiltonians, with whom the
                    author's sympathies lie, and the "agrarian" idealists led by 
                        Madison
                    . Washington, Adams, and to a lesser degree Jefferson, receive much less attention. The
                    conflict became worse, he correctly observes, because each side wildly misrepresented the position
                    of the other. Varg is less safe when he declares, commenting on the Republican regime that gained
                    power in 1801, that "Jefferson and Madison began by rejecting existing realities and sought
                    to implement an ideal" (p. 146), and then in succeeding passages both describes and singles
                    out for notice the many compromises with idealism, some forced and some voluntary, made by Jefferson
                    and 
                        Madison
                    . War finally came in 1812, he says, primarily as a consequence of economic pressures
                    upon a people who preferred idealism as a course of action.

            This volume, the second by Professor Cunningham on the Jeffersonian Republican party, will not
                    disappoint those who awaited its appearance. It is a clearly written, scholarly study of the
                    practical operations of the party during the Jefferson administration. It continues
                    Cunningham's account of party operations which was terminated in the first book with the
                    election of 1800.
            The first transfer of national power from one party to another forced Jefferson and the party leaders
                    to evolve patronage policies. The new President was more sanguine, and unrealistic, than many in his
                    party in anticipating a Federalist-Republican amalgamation. In this spirit he wrote that he would
                    disturb no man "for mere difference of principle" (p. 24). Those to be dismissed
                    included officials guilty of misconduct, the Adams lame duck appointees, and federal attorneys.
                    Uncompromising Federalist activity, however, ended any hope of a rapprochement; meanwhile party
                    pressure compelled Jefferson to announce an expanded program of removals in his famous reply to the 
                        New Haven
                     remonstrance. Although he later resumed a cautious policy, his own calculations
                    revealed that the Republicans held 60 per cent of the appointive offices by 1803. Throughout his
                    administration he was aware that his policy suited few in either party.
            In discussing congressional leadership, Cunningham concentrates on the House of Representatives. A
                    struggle for leadership marked  House proceedings during the
                    Seventh Congress. It did not prevent, however, the passage of the party's program.
                    Jefferson was not completely satisfied with John Randolph's work in the succeeding
                    Congress, but his efforts to groom Caesar Rodney for House leadership were frustrated. After 
                        Randolph
                     broke with the administration, the President experienced continued frustration in this
                    respect, although his major policies were approved by the House.
            Factionalism based on personal ambition, patronage disputes, and policy considerations was a constant
                    threat to Republican unity. As regards state level controversies, this account demonstrates that
                    Jefferson maintained correct relations with all factions but endorsed none publicly. The discussion
                    of the isolation of Aaron Burr and the counter-measures against 
                        Randolph
                     reveals Jefferson's success in molding national party policy. Professor
                    Cunningham follows his own recent article on the Quids to demolish the older notion that they were a
                    third party united under 
                        Randolph
                    's leadership.
            A commendable feature of the book is its examination and analysis of the party machinery in every
                    state—a welcome contrast to the first volume which was selective in its treatment of
                    state material. By the time of 
                        Madison
                    's inauguration the Middle Atlantic states had the most advanced party
                    organizations; in the South, with the exception of 
                        Virginia
                    , informal influences and occasional local organizations directed affairs.
                    Electioneering techniques, particularly in the South, and basic national party issues are described.
                    While Jefferson's anonymous newspaper articles are brought into full view, the drive of
                    party leaders to enlarge and improve their newspaper coverage is treated in rather broad terms.
            It is lamentable that this fine account contains no recognition and assessment of the implications
                    for the party of Chilton Williamson's work on suffrage reform. Nevertheless, the book is
                    distinguished for its perceptive qualities and its judicious balance in the treatment of national
                    and state party operations. While the thoughts and activities of Jefferson and his close adviser,
                    Albert Gallatin, are examined in great detail, other national captains and significant local leaders
                    are not ignored. Nor is Cunningham afraid to point to Jefferson's inconsistencies, although
                    he writes with an understanding pen. Based as it is on prodigious research, this excellently printed
                    volume is a valuable contribution to the study of Jefferson the President and the Republican party.

            This rich, lively, and representative collection of descriptions and commentaries on the Jacksonian
                    era is the fourth book in a six-volume series entitled The American Epoch Series
                    under the general editorship of Frank Freidel of 
                        Harvard
                     University. Clement Eaton of the University  of 
                        Kentucky
                    , who has collected and edited the book, is to be congratulated for having brought
                    together contemporary accounts which admirably delineate the character and the color of the time as
                    it appeared to a rather catholic and frank group of observers representing both American and foreign
                    backgrounds. A random sampling of these writers—including such well-known luminaries as
                    Andrew Jackson, Thomas H. Benton, John C. Calhoun, Martin 
                        Van
                     Buren, Sir Charles Lyell, Harriet Martineau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, William Gilmore
                    Simms, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Alexis de Tocqueville, to name but a few—? indicates both
                    the variety of their backgrounds and approaches and the competence of their analyses. Certainly the
                    book lives up to the claim on the jacket that it is "a compact library of the original
                    sources."
            The general introduction written by the editor is helpful in setting the scene for the primary
                    writings, and in recalling some of the main issues and characteristics of the period. A short
                    introduction to each of the sections points up particular issues and ideas which are to be found in
                    the contemporary writings that follow and also assists the reader in identifying the authors.
            Occasionally it is difficult from reading the Table of Contents to decide what the subject or point
                    of view of a particular selection may be, because the titles of the selections and the brief
                    quotations which follow them are not always very revealing. The use of these short quotations,
                    however, is generally fresh and interesting as well as informative.
            The organization of the book is clear and logical. Attempting to cover a variety of subjects from a
                    variety of viewpoints, the book might well have developed into chaotic history, but the editor has
                    managed to maintain both variety and order by orienting the writing around political, geographic,
                    social, and ideological facets of American life. Thus there are sections on government, the North,
                    the Old South, the 
                        Mississippi
                     Valley, the reformers and preachers, the plain people, the emigrants and Manifest
                    Destiny, and the American character. Finally, and most important of all, the writings are most
                    judiciously selected and therefore represent vividly and accurately the kaleidoscope of opinion then
                    extant on all these areas and topics. The grace and chivalry of the Old South, for example, is
                    contrasted with the evils of slavery; the raw ebullience and sharp practice of the Yankee are placed
                    alongside the sturdy egalitarianism of the yeoman farmer. It appears that no significant area of
                    American life has been neglected or slurred over with protective bias.
            While the book can only whet the appetite of the professional historian for more of the same, even he
                    can find here a useful collection of primary accounts. The less sophisticated student making his
                    first foray into the sources may well come to a much deeper understanding of the color, the flavor,
                    and the vitality of history. In short, he will learn something about the raw material out of which
                    history is written, and will perhaps begin to understand better the way in which historical
                    generalization grows out of the infoi-mation and insight derived from the original sources. It is
                    difficult to see how he could avoid catching some of the perennial excitement of the historian at
                    his task.

                    $5.00.)
            This book is well written and researched and accomplishes in the main what its author intended. By
                    taking as his vantage point the Democratic party, Professor Hollingsworth presents a number of
                    original insights into the personalities and events forming his rightly named whirligig in the
                    decade from 1893 to 1904, a time when party platforms tended to come full circle and when party
                    loyalties veered with the winds of changing conviction.
            Since, as the Preface points out, most major national problems had also to be fought out within the
                    only truly national political party, a study of internecine Democratic battles provides an
                    especially colorful reflection of the times. The reflection, to be sure, is a distorted one, for
                    Democrats and their singularly wrongheaded leaders acted with even more than the normal degree of
                    American irrationality in developing issues with sufficient emotional appeal for voters. The
                    Democrats' job was often easy, for opinion over our hotheaded stumbling into the world
                    power arena at the turn of the century was divided and acrimonious. And even more explosive was the
                    issue of silver, that metallic touchstone of the misguided. Never understood and seldom even
                    objectively approached, the silver question immeasurably complicated domestic American politics by
                    injecting volatile elements of self-interest aligned on class and regional lines in a fashion more
                    dangerous than anything seen since the Civil War.
            Professor Hollingsworth provides a lucid account of how the one political party with a potential for
                    uniting the country could instead tear itself apart by rallying behind leaders like Bryan and 
                        Cleveland
                    , men dedicated to sharpening divisive issues at a time when conciliation of those
                    issues would have meant Democratic success on a national scale. Understandably, Democratic party
                    fortunes underwent a rapid decline from control of both White House and Congress in 1893 to the low
                    of 1904, when virtually the only Democrats left in office were persistent perennials of the Solid
                    South.
            In analyzing the Democratic decline, The Whirligig of Politics passes the major
                    tests of a good book. Both scholarly and readable, its judgments are supported by superbly
                    wide-ranging evidence skillfully sifted for significance, as in the ingenious detective work on the 
                        Chicago
                     vote of 1896 (p. 99). The focus of the study is suitably balanced between the detail
                    essential to an understanding of individual behavior in local episodes and the panoramic sweep
                    required for events on a national scale. Among the book's more important contributions to
                    our understanding of the period is the corrective applied to Nevins' version of the
                    "courageous" 
                        Cleveland
                    : viewed as a party leader 
                        Cleveland
                     was stubbornly tactless and dangerously ignorant of his role. Important, too, is
                    Professor Hollingsworth's conclusion that the effect of the free silver crusade was far
                    less destructive of Democratic unity and urban strength than has been generally supposed. His vivid
                    account of Bryan's extraordinary behavior at the 1904 Democratic convention goes far toward
                    explaining the nomination of the innocuous Judge Alton B. Parker.
            
            Written with a fond understanding of the frailties of the American political process, the book has
                    many of the attributes of a good yarn, including perceptible movement and a discernible beginning,
                    middle, and end. Nevertheless, since scholarship consists also of minutiae, the reviewer must look
                    for faults and report even minor ones. In my overseas location I have been able to make only a
                    limited check for accuracy, but the results were a bit disconcerting. For example, TR's
                    biographer appears as "Herbert" rather than Henry F. Pringle (p. 202) and the
                    source given for Bryan's daily average of speeches in 1896 (p. 86) can hardly be correct.
                    Calling 1893 "the worst depression in the nation's history" (p. 10) is
                    probably only evidence of inexact expression, but even the most tolerant reader may wonder about
                    statements in the same paragraph that Bryan "had gone unobserved by most commentators on
                    national affairs" but that he had "attracted nationwide attention with his
                    speeches" (p. 50).∗ Then, too, while the book's
                    documentation is exhaustive to the point of including M.A. theses and papers read to learned
                    societies, the best source is not always brought in nor do footnotes always appear at the most
                    applicable spot. But they are, mercifully, at the bottom of each page of text, and the
                    bibliographical essay at the end provides a fine general evaluation of sources.
            The impression remains that in this book a skilled young scholar has contributed admirably to his
                    field. More works like this growing out of doctoral dissertations would go far toward settling
                    discussions on the value of that traditionally required "contribution to
                    knowledge."

               Federal Conservation Policy, 1921-1933. By Donald C. Swain. University of 
                            California
                         Publications in History, Volume 76. (Berkeley: University of 
                        California

                    $4.00.)
            This book deals with the idea of conservation, particularly the history of the movement in its
                    American aspect during the administrations of Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover. Swain devotes a chapter
                    each to the federal administrative and conservation policies touching the commonly recognized
                    resources of water, timber, soil, wildlife, minerals, and natural beauty. A final chapter posits the
                    Republican era as a prelude to the New Deal. The author attempts "to establish the
                    direction in which the sprawling federal conservation program was moving during the 1920's
                    and to indicate those facets of national resource policy which contributed to the progress of the
                    conservation movement" (p. 8).
            The author has utilized much unpublished material in the National Archives, the Library of Congress,
                    and the records sections of the departments and bureaus of the federal government. His research
                    reveals that the 1920's were productive years for conservation in 
                  
                     ∗ After this review of The Whirligig of
                                Politics was completed an errata slip covering several points, including one
                            mentioned here, was received from the publisher.
               
                     America. Indeed, Swain concludes that it was in that decade
                    that the foundations for subsequent New Deal conservation achievements were laid. True to his
                    scholarly interest in the evolution of science in America, Swain carefully notes the growth and
                    emphasis upon scientific research in almost every facet of conservation. He documents the struggle
                    leading to the acceptance of principles of multi-purpose resource planning and how it went hand in
                    hand with increased federal reliance upon science.
            Perhaps the most interesting point made—but one on which the author fails to
                    capitalize—is the leadership role in the progress and achievement of any worthwhile
                    venture. Swain observes Harding's and Coolidge's utter lack of anxiety in matters
                    of conservation and comments upon the ambivalent attitude of Hoover. But in this vacuum of executive
                    leadership appear Gifford Pinchot and his successors William B. Greeley and R. Y. Stuart on the one
                    hand and Stephen Mather and his alter ego Horace M. Albright on the other. This is, to borrow a
                    phrase from Shakespeare, "a paradox that chastens as it mocks." Swain is at his
                    best when writing about the foresters' commitment to utilitarian conservation and the
                    parkmen's to preservation. The reader becomes vividly aware of the high devotion and
                    ceaseless energy of Greeley, Stuart, Mather, and Albright on behalf of their respective causes.
            Once the historian discovers that in the administrations of three American
                    presidents—Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover—there existed on the part of the
                    chief executive no conservation leadership, then there is room for further comment. It is not enough
                    to observe that "Nevertheless, the Park Service bureaucracy attained its success while
                    operating within the pattern of Republicanism" (p. 142). In such an atmosphere of executive
                    unconcern and laissez faire we can be thankful for men of vision like Stephen Mather and Gifford
                    Pinchot. But, the next moment we must observe the waste of human and monetary resources in the
                    pointless struggle between the forest and park services. Pinchot speaks of forestry and conservation
                    as if he had a monopoly on its concept. Indeed, the words which Pinchot repeatedly stated,
                    "Conservation means the greatest good to the greatest number for the longest time"
                    (p. 7), are a paraphrase of the definition of his theoretician W J McGee. No less wrong, the
                    preservationists speak of conservation as if they alone possessed its wisdom. Conservation is
                    many-sided. Herein lies the difficulty. Thus, it never was a question of exclusiveness. And an
                    interested Republican or Democratic chief executive should embrace a conservation philosophy which
                    includes Gifford Pinchot and Stephen Mather. Furthermore, it is the President's task to
                    make them appreciate the opposite viewpoint and work together for the good of the nation.
            From 1921 to 1933 not only was there uneven bureaucratic leadership, but there were also sporadic
                    attempts by congressional leaders to oppose the Republican chief executives. Professor Swain
                    concludes his interesting and important monograph: "Contrary to widely held opinion, the
                    national conservation program did not deteriorate in the 1920's. It expanded and
                    matured" (p. 170). Yet when the vigorous conservation leadership rendered by the two
                    Roosevelts is recalled, some followers of Clio would be tempted to dwell upon what might have been.

               In Search of Peace: The Senate Munitions Inquiry, 1934-36. By John E. Wiltz. ([
                        Baton Rouge
                    ]: 
                        Louisiana
                     State University Press, 1963. Pp. xi, 277. Illustrations, bibliographical essay, notes,
                    index. $6.50.)
            It is a commentary upon the partiality of contemporary observers, upon the eagerness of the mind to
                    believe what it wills to believe, and upon the tendency of writers of general histories to accept
                    widely held subjective judgments as fully and objectively valid that the task of setting the record
                    straight is left to monograph writers of later generations. Thus within the year, Armin Rappaport,
                    for example, revised an all-but-universally-held evaluation of the role of the Navy League; Wayne S.
                    Cole put the career of Senator Gerald P. Nye in proper perspective; and now John E. Wiltz has
                    provided a balanced (but lively) account of the Senate Munitions Inquiry of 1934-1936 which will
                    demand a revision of prevailing historical interpretations in regard to the processes of foreign
                    policy and public opinion formation in the mid-1930's.
            Wiltz traces the origins of the munitions inquiry; he analyzes the varied roles and contributions of
                    its senatorial members and its staff (Stephen Raushenbush, not Alger Hiss, was the crucial staff
                    member); he provides a detailed description of its procedural methods and a summary of its
                    substantive findings; he sets forth those factors and forces which led to its demise; and finally,
                    on the basis of the evidence, he offers an evaluation of its impact both upon public opinion and
                    upon legislation.
            Among his many conclusions the author demonstrates that although the Senate committee set out to dig
                    up proof that during World War I munitions manufacturers had been "merchants of
                    death," it found but scraps of evidence to support its hunch, and that it failed,
                    therefore, "to establish existence of an international munitions conspiracy" (p.
                    98). So also in its investigation of the ship-building industry, of war profiteering, of J. P.
                    Morgan and other financiers—-the evidence would not support a conspiracy interpretation
                    of national and world events. The committee majority, Professor Wiltz concludes, "hoped to
                    persuade Americans that the 
                        United States
                     should avoid economic ties with countries at war, that it should not become an arsenal
                    for belligerents" (p. 227). But the investigation, he reports, "bore only a minor
                    responsibility in passage of the neutrality laws" (p. 228). It failed to win an effective
                    control of international munitions trade; it failed to secure restrictions upon lobbying; it failed
                    to win means for the control of collusive bidding. It won a few modest achievements—the
                    passage of a loan-credit amendment to the Neutrality Act, for example; it contributed to the
                    establishment of the National Munitions Control Board; its findings made possible a more effective
                    mobilization after 1941. Wiltz concludes, moreover, that the committee's investigations
                    were usually carefully conducted, that witnesses were not hounded or harried, and that the committee
                    was no more guilty of "politics" than is usually the case in such inquiries.
            The book has the ring of truthfulness because it portrays the real complexity of events where once
                    simplicity prevailed. Studies such as  this demonstrate again
                    the hazards of attempting general overall interpretations of an era (particularly one so close to
                    the present) before the hard, detailed research has been accomplished.

            Of indefinite projection, these are the first eight volumes in the Figures
                    Canadiennes series of paperbacks. Quick digests of salient biographical information about some
                    of the men prominent in Canadian history, apparently for consumption by the layman, the commuter
                    trade, or the student, they range in time from the establishment of New 
                        France
                     into the early decades of the present century.
            With one exception, each is concerned with the life, sometimes the life and times, of one man. The
                    exception, Les Fougueux Bâtisseurs, is a series of thumbnail sketches
                    of adventurers who were animated by "une ferveur qui par sa qualité se rapproche
                    de l'enthousiasme presque religieux des compagnons de Roland" (p. 5). They include
                    Charles Le Moyne, colonizer and head of a famous family of sons; Pierre d'Iberville, one of
                    the sons, who merits a place "très particulière" in the
                    history of New 
                        France
                     and who should have a full scale biography in this series; Louis Hebert,
                    "valeureux apothicaire" and 
                        Canada
                    's first farmer; Marc Lescarbot, historian and poet; François Hertel
                    who ravaged New 
                        England
                     villages; Nicolas Perrot, a voyageur who established "une
                    généreuse entente" with the Indians and left his valuable Memoire; Pierre Boucher, pioneer governor and historian; Pierre Radisson and
                    Médart Groseilliers, fur traders and explorers who ranged over vast areas of the
                    wilderness and who later inspired organization of the Hudson's Bay Company; and Louis
                    Jolliet, "grand voyageur devant l'Éternel."
            There is considerable qualitative difference among these volumes. Those by Serge Fleury and Pierre
                    Benoit are substantially superficial and romanticized. By its very inclusiveness, Fleury's
                    book can hardly do more than skim the surface. Benoit's account of Paul de Chomedey, Sieur
                    de Maisonneuve, founder of Montreal, leaves Maisonneuve still in need of a first-class biography and
                    Montreal of a first-class history.
            
            Rosario Bilodeau's Cham-plain and Roger Viau's La
                        Salle are quite respectable and are based upon familiar sources and secondary accounts.
                    They are acceptable reliable introductions to their subjects. Although the lives of John George
                    Lambton (Lord Durham) and Guy Carleton (Lord Dorchester) are still fruitful fields of study for
                    historians, Viau and Benoit, each two timers in the series, have written useful summaries.
            While the makings of a biography on Wilfrid Laurier are perhaps easier to come by than for any other
                    man in these eight volumes, it is disappointing that Raymond Tanghe does not take advantage of this
                    by introducing new information to his readers and by offering his own interpretations of the age of
                    Laurier. Despite this, Laurier: Artisan de VUnite Canadienne is one of the best of
                    the Figures Canadiennes.
            
            In most respects, the best is the Frontenac biography. Although something is
                    inevitably lost in the process, Franchise de Tilly deserves much credit for this translation of Frontenac: The Courtier Governor, first published in English in 1959. Even though
                    the format of the series does not permit it, it is still regrettable that the documentation and
                    other historical apparatus which William Eccles presented in the English edition could not be
                    included in this one.
            Most of these books serve their purpose fairly well. Except for bringing conformity to the format of
                        Figures Canadiennes, editorial supervision is apparently exercised at a
                    minimum. An extension of editorial scrutiny and standards—with the Tanghe and Eccles
                    contributions as examples—would improve the qualitative tone of the volumes to come.
                    Additions to Figures Canadiennes are awaited with interest. And if perhaps the
                    publishers entertain the idea of an English equivalent, this too would be of merit.

                        California
                     Press, for the Bancroft Library, 1963. Pp. viii, 379. Index. $15.00.)
            To researchers in the fields of Latin American and Western American history the Bancroft Library at
                    the University of 
                        California
                     has long been an academic citadel. In this magnificent library are housed more than
                    four million manuscripts pertaining to the above mentioned fields. An important portion of these
                    manuscripts, together with the largest single collection of printed books (40,000) in these areas,
                    were initially collected by the historian Hubert Howe Bancroft and were sold to the University of 
                        California
                     in 1905. Since then, especially under the directorships of Herbert Eugene Bolton and,
                    more recently, George P. Hammond, these original collections have been appreciably augmented.
            For the library staff and users alike, these materials have been habitually referred to as the
                    "old" (the original collection) and the "new" collections. Until
                    the publication of the present volume the best and perhaps only complete guide to the
                    "old" manuscripts was in the voluminous footnotes and bibliographical references
                    appearing in Bancroft's  colossal thirty-nine volume
                    history based upon his own collection. Gradually card catalogues developed, and
                    now—thanks to many devoted members of the staff and especially to the editors of the
                    present volume—there is currently being produced a three-volume guide to the manuscript
                    collections presently housed in the Bancroft Library. The particular volume discussed here, and the
                    first to appear, covers the American West, minus the 
                        California
                     manuscripts. To come are a one-volume guide to the 
                        California
                     materials and a one-volume guide to the manuscript materials relating to Mexico,
                    Central America, and Spanish Colonial America. In preparation for these guides the director relates
                    that the entire classification of the collections was altered in such a way as to bring the
                    "old" and the "new" into proper physical relationship
                    "without loss of identity" of each. For all this the fraternity of Western
                    American scholars owes much thanks to Director 
                        Hammond
                    , who possessed the imagination to see what was needed as well as the administrative
                    ability and fortitude necessary to execute this grand design.
            The volume now published is the epitome of simplicity. The various manuscript items or collections
                    are arranged alphabetically by states. The contents of each unit are noted and briefly described.
                    Thus under 
                        Oregon
                     one finds listed: "Lane, Joseph, 1801-1881. Autobiography.
                            
                  Portland, Oregon
               . 1878." A call number follows. And this in turn is
                    followed by a four- or five-line statement as to the contents of this particular manuscript. When
                    the last of the three volumes appears, George P. Hammond, with the able assistance of Dale L.
                    Morgan, will have achieved a highly laudable goal he set for himself when in 1946 he assumed the
                    directorship: the finding of a way to make the resources of Bancroft Library better known and more
                    readily available to scholars.

                    Much of the research for this account was done in local newspapers and courthouse records,
                    especially in old documents concerning the county commissioners, real estate transactions, census
                    data, and marriage records. Information was also obtained from talking with residents, from
                    tombstones, from correspondence, and from previous histories of the locality.

                    in Lima. As noted in the Introduction, documentary material concerning the migration to 
                        Oregon
                     during the fifties is less abundant than for the forties. The medical experiences and
                    observations of Dr. White add interest and value to this letter, and the editorial comments increase
                    its usefulness. This letter was made available for publication by Mrs. Fred Deal of La Grange,
                    Indiana.
            
               Amish Society. By John A. Hostetler. (
                        Baltimore
                    : The Johns Hopkins Press, 1963. Pp. xviii, 347. Notes, maps, charts, tables,
                    illustrations, bibliography, index. $6.50.) This is among the best of the many books that
                    have been published about the Amish. The author was Amish by birth, but his family was later
                    "excommunicated" from the fold. While obtaining his doctorate at Pennsylvania
                    State University and since, Hostetler has studied and written about the Amish. This book gives
                    particular attention to the Amish of Pennsylvania but considers also their settlements in 
                        Ohio
                    , Indiana, 
                  Iowa, Canada
               , and  elsewhere. It
                    interprets Amish religious beliefs, analyzes their society, and describes their family life.
                    Hostetler uses enough of the jargon of the sociologist to indicate his professional status but not
                    enough to spoil his volume for the general reader. Especially interesting is the description of the
                    variety and cleavages which exist within Amish society, the tendency toward revolt among Amish
                    youth, and the manner in which change creeps into Amish life. The description of how one Amish
                    church in Pennsylvania gradually adapted its rules and practices to permit automobiles is intriguing
                    (pp. 298-304). Amish Society, however, is a descriptive scholarly study and not an
                    expose.
            
               Life in 
                            Detroit
                         under Pontiac's Siege. By Howard H. Peckham. (

                    : 
                        Wayne
                     State University Press, for The 
                        Detroit
                     Historical Society, 1964. Pp. ix, 24. Paperbound, $.75.) This booklet
                    reproduces the fifteenth annual Lewis Cass lecture, presented by Peckham in April, 1963, before the 
                        Detroit
                     Historical Society. The Cass Lectureship, inaugurated in 1948 by the Society, provides
                    for its members "speakers and scholars of renown to promote and maintain cultural and
                    historical interests." Though these lectures have not provided new contributions to
                    historical knowledge, they have—as this address by Peckham illustrates—indeed
                    been useful in developing interest in the history and culture of 
                        Michigan
                     and the Midwest as well as the 
                        Detroit
                     area.
            
               Song of Metamoris. By Milford E. Anness. (
                  Caldwell, Idaho
               : The
                    Caxton Printers, Ltd., 1964. Pp. xviii, 509. Illustrations. $5.95.) 
                        Milford
                     Anness has long been interested in Indiana's history, especially that
                    connected with the pioneer era and the historic Indians. His Song of Metamoris is
                    a novel of Indian-white relations in the Old Northwest during the early nineteenth century.
                    Metamoris is a legendary chief of the 
                        Delaware
                     and one of the few fictional characters in this novel; he is also the personification
                    of Tecumseh. Supporting characters include William Henry Harrison, John Conner, Little Turtle, and
                    other historical persons of the period. Anness attempts to picture early relations between Indians
                    and whites from the Indian point of view. The author believes that the Indians had the same basic
                    outlook on life, on God, and on nature as had the frontiersmen.
            
               True Indian Stories with Glossary of Indiana Indian Names. By James Piatt Dunn.
                    Reprint. (North 
                        Manchester
                    , Ind.: Lawrence W. Shultz, 1964. Pp. 320. Illustrations. $4.00.) This volume
                    of Indian stories, which first appeared nearly six decades ago, is based both on historical sources
                    and on traditions about the Indians. Despite considerable research on and knowledge of the Indians
                    exhibited by Dunn, the word "true" in the title infers an accuracy not then or
                    even now possible in many items about Indians. The stories are nevertheless interesting, include
                    much that is reliable, and are valuable in introducing students and adults to important
                    personalities and questions concerning Indian history. Dunn's True Indian
                        Stories can be very useful in teaching Indiana history to junior high school students.
